Few studies have combined traditional methods and molecular tools for the analysis of dispersal in fragmented landscapes. Here seed dispersal distances were documented for the tree Dipteryx panamensis in continuous forest and two forest fragments in Costa Rica, Central America. Distance matrices were calculated between adult trees (n = 283) and the locations of seeds (n = 3016) encountered along 100 × 4-m transects (n = 77). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the density of seeds dispersed > 25 m from the nearest adult (n = 253) among sites. There was a strong correlation between the locations of dispersed seeds and the locations of overstorey palms favoured as bat feeding roosts in continuous forest and both fragments. Exact dispersal distances were determined for a subset of seeds (n = 14) from which maternal endocarp DNA could be extracted and matched to maternal trees using microsatellite analysis. Dispersal within fragments and from pasture trees into adjacent fragments was documented, at a maximum distance of 853 m. Results show no evidence of a fragmentation effect on D. panamensis seed dispersal in this landscape and strongly suggest bat-mediated dispersal at all sites.",

The total length of the circular M. ricketti mitogenome is 17,098 base pairs, containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and a non-coding control region (D-loop region). The gene order and organisation of this mitogenome are similar to most of other determined vertebrate mitogenomes, with the nucleotide base composition of A 34.22%, T 30.32%, C 22.80%, and G 12.66%. Besides, the mitogenomic D-loop region contains 29 copies of a tandem repeat sequence of six nucleotides (CATACG). The phylogenetic analysis indicates that M. ricketti is closely related to M. macrodactylus and M. petax. This study will contribute to the investigations of phylogeny and evolution for Myotis and its relevant taxa.",

No detectable karyotypic difference was found between the two species (2« = 38, FN = 54). By comparison of G-band patterns between Vespertilio species and Nyctalus lasiopterus (2n = 42, FN = 50), it was revealed that the four pairs (M-l, 2, 3 and 6) of six large M-autosome pairs found in Vespertilio are homologous to the four large biarmed pairs (nos. 1, 2, 3 and 8) in N. lasiopterus, and the remaining two large M-pairs (M-4 and 5) in Vespertilio have been formed by centric fusions of the four medium-sized A-pairs (nos. 5 and 9 for M-4, and nos. 6 and 11 for M-5). This indicates that Vespertilio evolved from a certain Nyctalus species, such as N. lasiopterus, having a somewhat derived karyotype (2» = 42, FN = 50).The similarity of the C-band pattern on the complements of Vespertilio species and N, lasiopterus suggests that the karyotypic alteration from N. lasiopterus-]ike form to Vespertilio might have accomplished without a significant change in amount of C-band material.",

The lower incisors of Eptesicus fuscus, several species of Myotis, and Nycticeius humeralis (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae) are distinctive in general shape, the degree of rotation of each tooth, and the extent of overlap of each tooth. The incisor group is wider in Eptesicus than in the other species studied. Eptesicus shows very little rotation of the incisors, but the incisors of species of Myotis show rotation up to 150 degrees from the midline of the mandible. Incisor 1 shows the least rotation and incisor 3 shows the most rotation among the three incisors in Myotis. Overlap of the incisors appears to be indirectly related to rotation, with Eptesicus showing the most overlap and Myotis the least.",

            "abstractNote": "Daily torpor can provide significant energy savings, but in bats may reduce rates of fetal and juvenile development and spermatogenesis. We examined the use of torpor during the day by male and female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in the field during the female gestation, lactation, and postlactation periods. While both sexes used torpor, males used it significantly more often and used deeper torpor than did reproductive females, indicating that the costs of torpor are higher for reproductive females. We suggest that by using shallow torpor, females may gain some of the benefits of torpor while minimizing the fitness costs. The different patterns of torpor may be responsible for observed differences in day-roost location amongst males, reproductive females, and nonreproductive females. Males should choose roosts with lower ambient temperatures than do females in order to increase the energy savings of torpor. Males and nonreproductive females roosted away from the maternity colonies more often than did reproductive females. Within one maternity colony, males roosted in the west end of the colony, while females roosted in the east end. These patterns of roosting may be related to how the roost warms during the day.",

Xenorhinos halli, gen. et sp. nov., differs from all other hipposiderids in, among other features, its broad rostrum and interorbital region, exceptionally short palate, constricted sphenoidal bridge, and pronounced rotation of the rostrum. Its precise phylogenetic relationships remain obscure, but it appears to be part of an early hipposiderid radiation that includes species of Coelops, Cloeotis, Triaenops, and Rhinonycteris. and that is widely distributed throughout the Old World tropics. From analogy with living hipposiderids, the peculiar rostral and palatal morphology of X. halli is probably correlated with ultrasound production and emission, and, less certainly, with size and structure of the noseleaf.",

            "abstractNote": "Pteronotus davyi, Davy’s naked-backed bat, is a tropical bat whose current distribution in Mexico covers the watersheds of the Pacific and the Gulf coasts of Mexico, converges at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and continues into the Yucatan peninsula. We evaluated phylogeographic relationships among 18 populations in Mexico using data from the nucleotide sequence of the hypervariable II domain of the mitochondrial DNA control region from 105 specimens. Extant populations were distributed over 3 geographic regions (Pacific Coast, Gulf Coast, and Southeastern) that were delineated a priori according to floristic characteristics and biogeography. Coalescent simulations supported a phylogeographic model of 2 refugia situated in the south of Mexico (Arc and Soconusco refuges) during the late Pleistocene, followed by expansion into Pacific Coast, Gulf Coast, and Southeastern groups. The populations of the Southeast were genetically divergent from the Pacific and Gulf Coast populations, supporting the existence of 2 distinct lineages of P. davyi in Mexico, likely due to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec acting as a geographical barrier. Examination of our data revealed genetic differentiation of the Pacific and Gulf coastal groups but at a lower level relative to the Southeast. This pattern suggests that the Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, and Sierra Madre del Sur act as physical barriers to dispersal for P. davyi. DOI: 10.1644/08-MAMM-A-212R3.1.",

This genus forms a wellsupported monophyletic clade with at least twenty-one recognized species, as well as several others under taxonomic review. Sturnira parvidens is a widespread frugivorous bat of the deciduous forests of the Neotropics, is highly abundant, and is a major component in fruit dispersal to regenerate ecosystems. Methods. We used a technique based on Illumina paired-end sequencing of a library highly enriched for microsatellite repeats to develop loci for S. parvidens. We analyzed millions of resulting reads with specialized software to extract those reads that contained di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide microsatellites.",

Our goal was to determine the genetic identity of individuals belonging to different roosting groups. We tested the hypothesis of kin selection as a major force structuring group composition. We used 9 microsatellites designed for E. alba to determine the genetic identity and probability of parentage of individuals. We analyzed parentage and kinship using the software ML-Relate, GenAIEx, and Cervus. The obtained relationship probabilities (0.5) revealed a clear maternal relationship between female adults and offspring with allele compatibility, and at least 5 relationships between male adults and pups. We found a low degree of relatedness within roosting groups. Between roosting groups at different sites, the mean probability of a half-sibling relationship ranged from 0.214 to 0.244 and, for full-sibling relationship, from 0.383 to 0.553. Genetically, adult individuals were poorly related within clusters, and kinship as an evolutionary force could not explain group membership.",

The acarine infracommunities associated with this bat were analyzed, comparing bat populations from three arid regions of Mexico: an abandoned factory in Nombre de Dios, Durango; a cave in Santiago, Nuevo Leo´ n; and a church in Concepcio´ n del Oro, Zacatecas. The acarine infracommunity in Nuevo Leo´ nÕs bats exhibited the highest levels of diversity as reßected by a higher richness, a lower dominance, and a moderate and relatively homogeneous abundance in this locality in relation to the other two. This pattern is inßuenced by stable cave conditions relative to artiÞcial habitats. Notwithstanding, further studies are required to determine whether or not different habitat conditions are a primary factor in the process of structuring the acari infracommunities.",

In order to protect hibernating bats effectively, more knowledge about mortality factors is needed. During the winters of 2003–2015, we found 214 dead bats in 12 hibernacula in The Netherlands province of Zuid‐Holland. Most bat remains were found in December and January, with a second peak in April. Their remains showed a typical pattern of lesions consistent with those caused by predation by the wood mouse (\n              Apodemus sylvaticus\n              ). Trail camera surveys showed that wood mice actively searched for bats. Predation pressure seemed to vary between winters, with a peak in the winters of 2004, 2011 and 2015. The annual mortality (relative to the maximum winter population size) caused by wood mouse predation varied between 0.1 and 8.8 %, with a maximum local effect of 83.6 %. The years with high wood mouse predation pressure were characterized by a long frost period and a low mast production of common oak in the preceding autumn. The size of a hibernaculum and the population density of its bats had an effect on predation‐dependent mortality. The highest predation risk occurred near the entrance of bunkers. From these results we tentatively conclude that predation is not incidental and that wood mice actively search for and kill hibernating bats or scavenge for weakened individuals.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Sarawak has one of the highest diversity of fruit bats species (family Pteropodidae) in Malaysia, with 19 species described. Most coronavirus (CoV) studies have mainly focused on insectivorous bats, resulting in a lack of information on CoVs present in frugivorous bats. In addition, bat CoV surveillance activities are lacking in Malaysia.\nObjectives: Our study focuses on determining the presence of bat CoVs in dusky fruit bat (Penthetor lucasi).\nMethods: Guano samples belonging to P. lucasi were collected from Wind Cave Nature Reserve. The samples were screened for the presence of CoVs using validated heminested consensus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase consensus primers.\nResults: The bat CoV positivity rate was 38.5% (n = 15/39), with the viruses belonging to two subgenera: Alphacoronavirus (α-CoV) and Betacoronavirus (β-CoV). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that CoVs from 14 samples of P. lucasi belong to the genus α-CoV and may represent previously described genetic lineages in insectivorous bats in Wind Cave. However, only one sample of P. lucasi was detected with β-CoV which is closely related to subgenus Nobecovirus, which is commonly seen in frugivorous bats.\nConclusions: This study provides the first available data on CoVs circulating in P. lucasi.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats constitute one of the most numerous mammalian species. Bats have a wide range of dietary habits and include carnivorous, haematophagous, insectivorous, frugivorous and nectivorous species. The salivary glands of these species have been of particular research interest due to their structural variability among chiropterans with different types of diets. Myoepithelial cells (MECs), which support and facilitate the expulsion of saliva from the secretory portions of salivary glands, are very important for their function; however, this cell type has not been extensively studied in the salivary glands of bats. In this study, we characterized the MECs in the major salivary glands of the fruit bat Artibeus jamaicensis. Herein, we describe the morphology of the parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands of A. jamaicensis at the light- and electro-microscopic level and the distribution of MECs in these glands, as deﬁned by their expression of smooth-muscle markers such as a-smooth muscle actin (SMAa) and desmin, and of epithelial cell markers, such as KRT14. We found that the anatomical locations of the major salivary glands in this bat species are similar to those of humans, except that the bat sublingual gland appears to be unique, extending to join the contralateral homologous gland. Morphologically, the parotid gland has the characteristics of a mixed-secretory gland, whereas the submandibular and sublingual glands were identiﬁed as mucous-secretory glands. MECs positive for SMAa, KRT14 and desmin were found in all of the structural components of the three glands, except in their excretory ducts. Desmin is expressed at a lower level in the parotid gland than in the other glands. Our results suggest that the major salivary glands of A. jamaicensis, although anatomically and structurally similar to those of humans, play different physiological roles that can be attributed to the dietary habits of this species.",

A pilot study of nine adult male bats was conducted to determine whether use of the cave was regular enough for a homing study. Eight bats returned to the cave over the 3-week monitoring period, six on the night following release. Nine additional bats carrying radio transmitters were then released at three sites (three at each site) c. 5, 10 and 20 km due east of the cave; sites estimated to be located within, on the border of, and outside the population's known familiar area respectively. All but one of these nine bats were subsequently detected at the cave. Results suggest that adult long-tailed bats are able to return home following displacement both inside and outside their familiar area. Implications of these findings for translocations of bats and the possession of a potential long-distance navigation system by this species are discussed.",

Correlations of variation in CF with variation in body size, body condition, environmental humidity and presence of ecologically similar species are studied in an attempt to identify the forces driving the evolution of CF. We found that bats may adapt the frequency to humidity, and that CF may evolve under interspeci®c interactions, either of ecological or of social nature. The results support an adaptive value for the high values of CF, and challenge the `Allotonic Frequency Hypothesis'. We found correlation between frequency and a body condition index, which may trigger social selection processes in this species sexually dimorphic in CF. Combined social and environmental selection on CF could trigger diversi®cation of bats along ecotones separating habitats with contrasting air humidity.",

There were two main types of lingual papillae, mechanical (filiform) and gustatory (fungiform and circumvallate). The tongue was divided into three parts (apex, corpus and radix), and then, each part was subdivided into three regions (two lateral regions and a median region). There were six subtypes of the filiform papillae—three types on the anterior part (small, scale‐like and giant), one type on the middle part (leaf‐like papillae) and two types on the posterior part (rosette‐shaped filiform and conical filiform papillae)—in addition to transitional papillae presented on the corpus and radix. Two types of gustatory papillae were represented by a small number of fungiform papillae that are scattered among the filiform papillae on the lingual apex and corpus, while three circumvallate papillae on the posterior part are arranged in a “V” shape pointing directly at the larynx.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Acoustic signals play a crucial role in transmitting information and maintaining social stability in gregarious animals, especially in echolocating bats, which rely primarily on biological sonar for navigating in the dark. In the context of foraging without relying on tactile, visual or olfactory cues, acoustic signals convey information not only on food but also on ownership and defense of resources. However, studies on such information remain fragmentary. In the present study, we aim to document the social vocal repertoire of\n              Myotis macrodactylus\n              at natural foraging sites. Multiple acoustic analyses and spectrographic classification revealed a rich foraging vocal repertoire comprising 6 simple syllables and 2 composites. Discriminant function analyses associated with a subset‐validation procedure provided an optimal method to spectrographically classify all recorded sounds into different syllable types. Multidimensional scaling of median values of multiple parameters further confirmed notable differences among these syllables in a 3‐D space. In addition, Euclidean distance analysis showed that there were some spectral similarities between specific social vocal syllables and feeding buzzes, which implied a potential jamming role. Altogether, the data indicate that bats at foraging sites under natural conditions used variant social vocalizations with different functions in addition to echolocation calls, providing supporting evidence for further work on the function and vocal mechanisms of acoustic communication in mammals.",

In 15 September 2015, one Vespertilionid bat with a well-defined ochraceous collar running from the base of ears across the throat was collected at Shuijia Village, Guizhou Province, China. Based on its morphological characteristics and phylogenetic inference using partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, it was identified as T. aureocollaris, ­representing the first record of the species in China. This northernmost occurrence largely extends the species’ potential distribution area, and through Maxent modeling, its potentially suitable habitats are mapped herewith.",

            "abstractNote": "We used both highly variable mitochondrial and nuclear loci to investigate the large mouse‐eared bat species complex in the Western Palaearctic to clarify their systematic position. Although mitochondrial lineages show no species segregation and some haplotypes are shared between\n              \n                M\n                yotis myotis\n              \n              and\n              \n                M\n                yotis blythii sensu lato\n              \n              , Bayesian clustering methods based on multilocus genotypes indicate highly concordant nuclear and morphological species assignment. These multilocus, nuclear analyses detected only a single putative F\n              1\n              hybrid in the extensive areas of sympatry sampled, thus confirming the biological species status of\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii s.l\n              . We propose that the strong cytonuclear discordance in these species complex results from a combination of prior spatial isolation of the two species in different glacial refugia, followed by a succession of mitochondrial introgression events that occurred during the eastward and westward expansions of\n              M. myotis\n              and of\n              M. blythii\n              , respectively. The nuclear markers further indicate the presence of a notable genetic discontinuity within\n              M. myotis\n              that broadly separates populations into an eastern and a western component with an overlap zone in the Balkans. This eastern and western discontinuity is also apparent in the mitochondrial lineages with the D haplogroup largely confined to samples found in Thrace and Asia Minor. None of these genetic discontinuities correspond to the distribution of the two commonly recognized\n              M. myotis\n              subspecies (\n              myotis\n              and\n              macrocephalicus\n              ). We also show that distinct morphological subspecies within\n              M. blythii\n              (\n              oxygnathus\n              ,\n              omari\n              ,\n              risorius\n              and\n              lesviacus\n              ) in Europe and the near‐East do not correlate with significant evolutionarily units, whether identified by mitochondrial or nuclear data and thus only represent local morphological variants with little taxonomic relevance.",

In this study, we tested for sex and seasonal differences in the echolocation pulses of male and female big brown bats, and related these differences to mating activity. We recorded the echolocation pulses of adult female and male big brown bats in a controlled laboratory environment during the mating and three non-mating seasons. Factor analysis was used to reduce the number of call variables into two principle components (PC1 and PC2). Call components related to PC2 were significantly sexually dimorphic in the mating season. However, no call components were significantly sexually dimorphic in the non-mating season. In addition, we found a significant correlation between PC1 and the mating score of male bats. There was no significant correlation between principle components and the mating score of female bats. Our results provide additional support for the current literature that suggests a communicative function for bat echolocation pulses. Furthermore, it suggests that differences in the echolocation pulses of male and female bats may be important in the mating activity of this group.",

Large amounts of amyloid were detected in liver, spleen, kidneys, stomach, intestine, lymphatic tissues, and endocrine and salivary glands. Congo red staining and green birefringence identified amyloid; the Congo red staining was sensitive to potassium permanganate oxidation. The amyloid was further classified immunohistochemically. The deposits reacted with two anti-human-AA-amyloid monoclonal antibodies in a peroxidase-antiperoxidase reaction, whereas no reaction was found with antibodies specific for other types of amyloid. Thus, the bat amyloid deposits were identified as generalized reactive AA-amyloidosis.",

Individually, small islets with reduced human influence do not usually provide enough food for the barn owl. Consequently, the species expands its home range to include multiple islands or islets. This study is the first to document the regular crossing of broad sea channels (one of which exceeds 4.5 km) by barn owls in order to hunt. The islets provide the barn owls with prey otherwise considered as marginal (such as Oryctolagus cuniculus and Hydrobates pelagicus).",

Three samples were in good condition and the specimens redescribed. Litomosa hepatica (von Linstow, 1897) n. comb., sample ZMB Vermes Entozoa 3368, from the megachiropteran Pteropus neohibernicus, Bismarck Archipelago, resembles L. maki Tibayrenc, Bain & Ramanchandran, 1979, from Pteropus vampyrus, in Malaysia, but the buccal capsule differs. Both species display particular morphological characters which differ from species of Litomosa parasitic in microchiropterans. The remaining material originates from Brazil. The spicule morphology of Litomosoides circularis (von Linstow, 1899) Chandler, 1931, sample ZMB Vermes Entozoa 1059 from Hesperomys spec. (= Holochilus brasiliensis), Porto Alegre, confirms that it belongs to the sigmodontis group; the microfilaria presents characters of the genus Litomosoides, e.g. body attenuated at both extremities and salient cephalic hook. Taxonomic discussions by others confirm that species of Litomosoides belonging to the sigmodontis group and described subsequently are distinct from L. circularis. Litomosoides serpicula (Molin, 1858) Guerrero, Martin, Gardner & Bain, 2002, is redescribed, sample NMW 6323 from the bat Phyllostoma spiculatum (= Sturnira lilium), Ypanema. It is very close to L. brasiliensis Almeida, 1936, type host Moytis sp., but distinguished by a single ring in the buccal capsule, rather than two, supporting previous conclusions that the taxon L. brasiliensis, as generally regarded, may represent a complex of species. Samples NMW 6322 and NMW 6324, from other bats and also identified by Molin (1858) as Filaria serpicula, contain unidentifiable fragments of Litomosoides incertae sedis. Filaria hyalina von Linstow, 1890, sample ZMB Vermes Entozoa Q 3905 from Sorex vulgaris (= Sorex araneus), is incertae sedis because it contains two unidentifiable posterior parts of male, which might be an acuarid, Stammerinema sp. Filaria vesperuginis von Linstow, 1885, sample ZMB Vermes Entozoa Q 3929, from the bat Vesperugo serotinus (= Eptesicus serotinus), contains encysted nematode larvae and is a nomen dubium.",

The life cycles of five other species of Litomosoides are known; three are parasites of rodents, one of a marsupial and one of a bat. As with these species, the experimental vector of L. yutajensis used was the macronyssid mite Ornithonyssus bacoti. In nature, the main vectors are probably other macronyssids but transmission by O. bacoti, with its large host-range, could account for the characteristic host-switchings in the evolution of Litomosoides. Unlike the murine model L. sigmodontis Chandler, 1931, L. yutajensis is devoid of the endosymbiontic bacteria Wolbachia and may be of great interest.",

He named the new species Ia io, thereby creating a species name that is four letters in length—the shortest possible name allowed under the rules for naming a new species. In the time since, biologists have wondered why he chose this unusual name and what the name might mean in translation. The most widespread theory on the short name is that he was challenged by an American colleague to deliberately create the shortest species name possible. The question of what the name might mean in translation is more problematic. ‘Ia’ has been thought by most taxonomists to be a meaningless word, but ‘io’ has been suggested to refer to a mythological Greek priestess named Io. Herein, I show that the species name Ia io translates into ‘Shout hurrah!’ and demonstrate that the events in Oldﬁeld Thomas’s early professional life gave him an excellent reason for choosing this unusual species name in 1902.",

We tested whether male or female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) responded to variation in echolocation calls of the opposite sex in a manner that would suggest calls are used in a mating context. We presented 31 female and 10 male big brown bats with ultrasonic playbacks of differentially mating (i.e., high frequency copulators = HM versus low-frequency copulators = LM) individuals of the opposite sex. We measured 1) which side of the arena each subject selected first (HM versus LM), and 2) duration spent (seconds) on each side of the arena (HM versus LM). For both of these measures (i.e., first choice and duration) male subjects were more likely to select the echolocation calls of HM females, but the same respective tests determined that female subjects did not select echolocation calls of frequently copulating males over calls of infrequently copulating males. These results support the possibility that the echolocation calls of big brown bats provides information about the sender that may be important in a mating context.",

Some argue, however, that torpor is costly for both males and females and that individuals should only use it during times of poor foraging conditions. Others hypothesize that the costs are greater for females and that males should enter torpor more regularly. We tested these alternative hypotheses by using temperature‐sensitive radiotransmitters to monitor use of torpor and foraging by free‐ranging big brown bats (\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              ). During the pregnancy period, males used torpor at night more and foraged less often than did females. Males also went into deep torpor more often and remained in torpor longer than did females. When they foraged, males and females were away from the roosts for equal periods of time. During the lactation period, males and females rarely failed to forage and foraging times were again no different between the sexes, although males may roost at night away from the maternity colonies. Males again used torpor and deep torpor more often and for longer than females did. These results support the hypothesis that the fitness costs of using torpor are lower for males than for reproductive females and that males regularly use torpor as an energy‐saving mechanism. Females enter torpor only when foraging conditions are poor, presumably because torpor prolongs gestation and slows neonatal growth thereby leaving less time for females and their young to prepare for hibernation.",

Other Trypanosoma spp. that have been found exclusively in bats are not well characterized at the DNA sequence level and we have therefore used the SL RNA gene to differentiate and characterize kinetoplastids isolated from bats in South America. A Trypanosoma sp. isolated from bats in southern Brazil was compared with the geographically diverse isolates T. cruzi marinkellei, T. vespertilionis, and T. dionisii. Analysis of the SL RNA gene repeats revealed size and sequence variability among these bat trypanosomes. We have developed hybridization probes to separate these bat isolates and have analysed the DNA sequence data to estimate their relatedness. A new species, Trypanosoma desterrensis sp. n., is proposed, for which a 5S rRNA gene was also found within the SL RNA repeat.",

Aerodynamic theory is used to predict the most economical flight speeds, minimizing energy expenditure either per distance (maximal range speed,\n                    V\n                    mr\n                    ) or per time (minimal power speed,\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    ). When foraging in flight, flight speed also affects prey encounter and energy intake rates. According to optimal flight speed theory, such effects may shift the energetically optimal foraging speed to above\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Therefore, we predicted that if energetic considerations indeed have a substantial effect on flight speed of aerial‐hawking bats, they will use high speed (close to\n                    V\n                    mr\n                    ) to commute from their daily roost to the foraging sites, while a slower speed (but still above\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    ) will be preferred during foraging. To test these predictions, echolocation calls of commuting and foraging\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii\n                    were recorded and their flight tracks were reconstructed using an acoustic flight path tracking system.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Confirming our qualitative prediction, commuting flight was found to be significantly faster than foraging flight (9·3 vs. 6·7 m s\n                    −1\n                    ), even when controlling for its lower tortuosity.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    In order to examine our quantitative prediction, we compared observed flight speeds with\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    and\n                    V\n                    mr\n                    values generated for the study population using two alternative aerodynamic models, based on mass and wing morphology variables measured from bats we captured while commuting. The\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    and\n                    V\n                    mr\n                    values generated by one of the models were much lower than our measured flight speed. According to the other model used, however, measured foraging flight was faster than\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    and commuting flight slightly slower than\n                    V\n                    mr\n                    , which is in agreement with the predictions of optimal flight speed theory.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Thus, the second aerodynamic model we used seems to be a reasonable predictor of the different flight speeds used by the bats while foraging and while commuting. This supports the hypothesis that bats fly at a context‐dependent, energetically optimal flight speed.",

Their impact on disease dynamics is not completely understood, but their relationship with the local fauna can favour the emergence of zoonoses. We reported records of predation of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) by common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in the Brazilian Pantanal wetland and detailed how the traditional hunting, which involves castration management and hunting dogs, can represent a risk to emergency of rabies virus. With 1.43% of attack probability recorded by camera traps, we highlight the potential role of this interaction in disseminating zoonosis, especially in a scenario where hunting management has been prioritised as a policy tool in the control of exotic species. We alerted for the danger of rabies onset. Moreover, we suggested that the ranchers avoid contact with the pigs’ salivary secretions during hunting, to maintain up to date rabies vaccination on domestic animals, and pay attention to the clinical behaviours of rabies in their hunting dogs. Therefore, we must be aware of all the risks involved in interactions between humans and wildlife to reevaluate our practices and prevent viral outbreaks as we currently witness.",

At both sites, the original vegetation was Cerrado-Atlantic Forest ecotone and the bats were captured at elevations from 650 to 1,100 m. We compared our specimens of M. aztecus from southeastern Brazil with M. aztecus from Mexico, M. molossus from several parts of Brazil, M. coibensis from Panama, M. barnesi from French Guiana, and M. currentium from Paraguay. Capturing M. aztecus and M. molossus sympatrically reinforced their distinctiveness; they differ in morphometrical traits and qualitative characters of skull and pelage. We also found that specimens earlier identified as M. coibensis from Brazil, are referable to M. barnesi from French Guyana.",

Fresh fecal material was found under the bridges during every month of the year. We detected 5 insect orders, including 5 families, in fecal pellets collected from 25 August 2005 to 5 January 2007. Lepidoptera represented 93.7% of the total volume and was the only order observed in 100% of our samples. Coleopterans, mostly Scarabaeidae, were the second most abundant food item and represented 5.8% of the total volume. Hemiptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera together represented 0.4 % of the total volume. We observed Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera in fecal pellets collected under some, but not all bridges. No insect orders were observed that had not previously been reported as prey of Rafinesque’s Big-eared Bats. Our results were similar to those reported in studies conducted in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Florida, and we concluded that Rafinesque’s Big-eared Bats primarily prey upon lepidopterans in Louisiana.",

Many species exhibit an unusual reproductive cycle and extreme longevity without reproductive senescence, yet steroid proﬁles exist for few bats. Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) are temperate insectivores found throughout North America. They mate promiscuously in fall, store sperm during winter hibernation, and have delayed ovulation and fertilization in spring. Here, we report the ﬁrst urinary steroid proﬁle in bats by quantifying 17b-estradiol (E2) in captive male and female E. fuscus across their reproductive cycle. Male bats had higher urinary E2 levels than females, and adults had higher levels than yearlings following creatinine adjustment for hydration. In nonpregnant females, several seasonal differences in creatinine-adjusted and unadjusted urinary E2 levels were observed. Urinary E2 was higher in males than females in winter for both conditions and in autumn for creatinine-adjusted levels. We quantiﬁed progesterone (P4) in a subset of females. In nonpregnant females, urinary P4 was constant across seasons except for unadjusted levels, which were highest in the summer. In pregnant females, urinary E2 and P4 levels peaked beginning ~20 d before parturition, with both steroids returning to baseline in the following weeks. Knowing how urinary steroid levels ﬂuctuate with age and sex and across the annual season is key to understanding reproductive cycling in bats. Our research furthers the potential for bats as a model for medical reproductive research. Moreover, it complements previous studies on the potential role of steroids in primer pheromonal effects in bats.",

Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus (Palisot de Beauvois, 1796)) live in mixed-sex colonies and must differentiate between sexes to locate mates. We hypothesized that odour cues convey information about sex. In experiment 1, adult E. fuscus were recorded exploring a Y-maze that contained general body odours sampled from male or female conspeciﬁcs. One group of subjects was habituated to the Y-maze prior to experimental trials, whereas a second group was not. Bat exploration and the proportion of time spent near each scent were used as preference indicators for the body odour of a particular sex. Experiment 2 followed similar procedures except the odour cue tested was urine from either male or female conspeciﬁcs and without Y-maze habituation. Results found no evidence that E. fuscus prefer the body odours of a given sex, but females did prefer the odour of male urine. Non-habituated animals in experiment 1 were more likely to explore the Y-maze and approach a stimulus scent compared with habituated bats. These ﬁndings have important implications for courtship and mating behaviour in bats, as well for designing future behavioural studies.",

            "abstractNote": "The pollination biology and breeding system of Pseudobombax munguba, a tree species of the va´ rzea of the Amazonian ﬂoodplain, was studied by ﬁeld observations and hand pollinations using varying proportions of self and cross pollen. Progeny in sample fruits were tested for self or cross paternity using an isozyme genetic marker. Pseudobombax munguba has nocturnal, white, brushlike ﬂowers that, surprisingly, lack nectar, and they are pollinated by a single, large bat species, Phyllostomus hastatus. Although self pollen tubes penetrated ovules with equal facility to cross tubes, fully selfed ﬂowers failed to form fruits. Flowers with mixed (self + cross) pollinations set fewer fruits than those of full crosses, and the fruiting success decreased with self : cross pollen ratio (i.e., 1 : 1 vs. 3 : 1). Fruits from such mixed pollinations contained varying but generally low (mean 3.3%, range 0%–22%) numbers of selfed seed. We conclude that although P. munguba lacks a conventional stigmatic or stylar self-incompatibility mechanism, the combination of exclusive pollination by a wide-ranging bat vector and the death of most selfed ovules provide this species with a highly outcrossing mating system.",

Automatic bat detection units recorded 8728 bat passes and 933 feeding buzzes during 272 nights of sampling. In addition, five radio-tagged post-lactating female bats were each followed for an average of 13.0 ± 3.2 (SE) days. Home range size averaged 471.4 ± 50.9 ha (95% median minimum convex polygons) but core areas of activity (50% of fixes) were 54.4 ± 5.4 ha (11.6 ± 3.1% of the home range size). Patterns of activity varied in relation to time of year, time of night, temperature, invertebrate activity and habitat. Between January and March, long-tailed bats consistently emerged from day roosts at sunset and flew throughout the night, with peaks of activity shortly after sunset and before sunrise. After the beginning of April, long-tailed bats no longer flew throughout the night, but they had one peak of activity between the first and third hour after sunset. Both automatic monitoring and radio-telemetry showed extensive use by long-tailed bats of river and riparian habitats. Radio-tagged bats avoided foraging over open farmland, and repeatedly returned to the same sites on consecutive nights.",

            "abstractNote": "Barbastelles are commonly recorded in the vicinity of their wintering underground sites outside the hibernation season. It is uncertain why barbastelles visit hibernacula at this time of the year. Possible functions include feeding, resting, rearing of young, mating or stop-over sites during migration. To determine which of these functions are important I carried out observations at six large (max. 1,870 individuals) barbastelle hibernacula in SW Poland. To characterize daily and seasonal patterns of shelter use behaviour surveys were carried out at regular intervals throughout 2003 to 2005. Bats were mist-netted (73 nights) at hibernacula entrances and their age, sex and the development of caudae epidydimides in the males were determined. Their behaviour was sampled by recording (315 hours) their calls with a time-expansion bat detector in combination with direct observation and infrared filming. Hibernacula were not used as colony roosts, foraging places, day resting places or temporary night shelters. The hibernacula served primarily as mating sites. Both females and sexually active males (with fully developed caudae epidydimides) were seen in the highest numbers in August/September, when display flights, chases of individuals, low frequency social calling and copulations were observed. As the number of bats visiting hibernacula in the mating period was much higher than that observed in winter, the underground shelters appear to be at least as important for them in the mating period as in the winter. Barbastelle hibernation sites should therefore be protected from the beginning of mating period (August) till the end of hibernation.",

The commercial application of microbial chitinase is appealing due to the relative ease of enormous production and to meet the current world demands. This study aimed at isolation and characterization of chitin degrading bacteria from the gut of Indian tropical insectivorous black‐bearded tomb bat, Taphozous melanopogon. The isolated bacterial strains were characterized through biochemical analysis and nucleic acid‐based approaches by 16S ribosomal RNA amplification and sequencing. The BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) and phylogenetic analysis showed that the bacterial strain exhibited a close resemblance with Escherichia fergusonii. The chitinolytic activity of the E. fergusonii AMC01 was identified using supplemented colloidal chitin with agar medium. Compiling all, these findings would facilitate in constructing a database and presumably promote the use of E. fergusonii AMC01 as an efficient strain for the chitinase production.",

However, suspensory quadrupedal gaits are quite common for bats, but little is known about this type of movement and no data are available on how these animals load their limbs and support the body. Values for vertical, fore-aft and mediolateral peak forces were collected for the forelimb and hindlimb during suspensory quadrupedal locomotion in the large ﬂying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) and common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), and during terrestrial locomotion in the common vampire bats. During suspensory quadrupedal locomotion in both species, the hindlimbs serves as the primary weight-bearing and braking organ, whereas the forelimb has a reduced weight-bearing role and acts as the primary propulsive limb. Mediolateral forces are dominated by medially directed forces by the animal that likely serve to help maintain ‘grip’ while moving below supports. Kinetic patterns of terrestrial locomotion in the common vampire bat are completely opposite, and resemble data that has been reported for most mammals with the exception of relatively high lateral forces. The data presented here add to the growing body of knowledge that suspensory quadrupedal locomotion does not represent a neuromuscular mirror to non-suspensory quadrupedal gaits. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that suspensory quadrupedal gaits are not the same across mammals, and species have adopted multiple mechanical strategies for moving quadrupedally below a support.",

            "abstractNote": "Mastiff bats (genus Eumops, family Molossidae) are widely distributed in the neotropics and southern parts of the United States, and form the most taxonomically diverse genus of the family Molossidae with 14 species and six subspecies. The taxonomy of Eumops was treated in two broad studies, and recently, minor taxonomic changes were proposed. Relationships among taxa were historically proposed based on phenetic analyses using biochemical and morphometric data, but a phylogenetic analysis of all species within the genus is lacking. This study proposes a new hypothesis of relationships among most species and subspecies using morphological data and employing cladistic methods. Morphological complexes examined include skull, dentition, tongue, and external morphology; penial data were compiled from literature. The topology of a strict consensus cladogram revealed that one clade is composed of E. perotis + E. trumbulli, and is sister to (E. bonariensis + E. delticus + E. patagonicus + E. nanus + E. hansae in an unresolved polytomy). A second clade is composed of E. underwoodi + E. dabbenei, and a third consists of E. auripendulus and E. maurus, and both are sister to each other. Eumops glaucinus occupies a separate branch in an unresolved polytomy among clades defined above or as sister to E. perotis, E. hansae and E. bonariensis-complex. Results from this study contradict the relationships proposed by previous studies which considered E. auripendulus closer to E. glaucinus, and also disagree with previous outcomes that suggested the non-monophyly of the genus. Results from this study corroborate affinities of E. dabbenei with E. underwoodi, and the uncertain monophyly of E. bonariensis as a polytypic species, supporting the specific status of E. nanus and E. delticus as recently proposed.",

Increasing evidence suggests that signiﬁcant species differences exist in meloxicam metabolism. Because of this, dose extrapolation from domestic animals may not be appropriate for exotic species. The objective of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam in a population of male Malayan ﬂying foxes, Pteropus vampyrus, following a single oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Using a sparse sampling method based on a pilot study, two blood samples from each of 10 bats were collected over an 8-hr time period. Analysis of meloxicam in plasma samples was conducted using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The peak plasma concentration of 598 6 157.5 ng/ml occurred at 1.0 hr post dosing. The terminal half-life was 1.1 6 0.1 hr, which indicates that meloxicam is rapidly metabolized in this species. No adverse clinical effects were noted during the study period. A single oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg appears safe for use in male Malayan ﬂying foxes, but due to rapid elimination, frequent dosing may be required to maintain plasma concentrations within a therapeutic range. Multidose studies are needed to determine if plasma accumulation of meloxicam occurs.",

In Florida, most Gray Bats have been found to hibernate in one primary cave, where the number of hibernating individuals decreased from several thousand in the 1950s to zero in 1975 due to disturbance by humans and improper gating of the cave. After removal of the gate in 1982, the number of hibernating Gray Bats increased, averaging 166 bats during 1990–1998. The number then declined again, and <10 Gray Bats per year were counted during 2002–2011. The cause of this recent decline is uncertain. Temperatures in the cave remain suitably cold, visitation by humans is restricted, and no mortality from floods or disease has been observed. Most of the Gray Bats may have moved to larger and more suitable hibernacula in northern Alabama and Tennessee.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats vocalize during flight as part of the sensory modality called echolocation, but very little is known about whether flying bats consistently call. Occasional vocal silence during flight when bats approach prey or conspecifics has been documented for relatively few species and situations. Bats flying alone in clutter-­free airspace are not known to forgo vocalization, yet prior observations suggested possible silent behavior in certain, unexpected situations. Determining when, why, and where silent behavior occurs in bats will help evaluate major assumptions of a primary monitoring method for bats used in ecological research, management, and conservation. In this study, we recorded flight activity of Hawaiian hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus semotus) under seminatural conditions using both thermal video cameras and acoustic detectors. Simultaneous video and audio recordings from 20 nights of observation at 10 sites were analyzed for correspondence between detection methods, with a focus on video observations in three distance categories for which accompanying vocalizations were detected. Comparison of video and audio detections revealed that a high proportion of Hawaiian hoary bats “seen” on video were not simultaneously “heard.” On average, only about one in three visual detections within a night had an accompanying call detection, but this varied greatly among nights. Bats flying on curved flight paths and individuals nearer the cameras were more likely to be detected by both methods. Feeding and social calls were detected, but no clear pattern emerged from the small number of observations involving closely interacting bats. These results may indicate that flying Hawaiian hoary bats often forgo echolocation, or do not always vocalize in a way that is detectable with common sampling and monitoring methods. Possible reasons for the low correspondence between visual and acoustic detections range from methodological to biological and include a number of biases associated with the propagation and detection of sound, cryptic foraging strategies, or conspecific presence. Silent flight behavior may be more prevalent in echolocating bats than previously appreciated, has profound implications for ecological research, and deserves further characterization and study.",

            "abstractNote": "The barbastelle bat Barbastella barbastellus (Schreber, 1774), probably one of the rarest of western European bat species, has suffered from substantial population declines over the last several decades. In fact, it was believed to be extinct within the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate (western Germany) until the discovery of a maternity colony in 2004. More reproduction sites have since been found, which demonstrates a substantial knowledge gap about the actual distribution and abundance of the species in Rhineland-Palatinate. Suitable habitats for maternity colonies are crucial for the survival of a population and knowledge of their location is critical for conservation. We modelled the suitability of habitats for use by maternity colonies in Rhineland-Palatinate based on high-resolution data of the forest structure and roosting sites of maternity colonies, using the presence-only machine learning approach MaxEnt. In addition to statistical tests of the model performance, we analysed general occurrence surveys from the last few years for evidence of barbastelle and conducted an in-situ survey on one of the sites identified as highly suitable by the model, but for which no occurrence records exist. On this site, we discovered a new maternity colony. Analysis of third-party surveys resulted in two recently discovered colonies, which shows the barbastelle’s range is not restricted to the area south of the Moselle River. The results of our study along with the scattered pattern of potentially suitable locations for maternity colonies in the region challenge previous assumptions of the geographic distribution of barbastelle in Rhineland-Palatinate. This study demonstrates the potential of habitat suitability modelling in conservation ecology and the results may provide a basis for future preservation strategies in the region.",

Herein we resolve the phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy of the species complex\n              M\n              .\n              manavi\n              on Madagascar and in the Comoro Archipelago, where these animals occur in different bioclimatic zones. First using mitochondrial cytochrome‐\n              b\n              sequence data to define clades and then morphology to corroborate the molecular data, including comparisons to type specimens, we demonstrate that animals identified as this taxon are a minimum of three species:\n              M\n              .\n              manavi sensu stricto\n              occurs in at least the central portion of the Central Highlands;\n              M\n              .\n              griveaudi\n              has a broad distribution in lowland northern and central western Madagascar and the Comoros (Anjouan and Grande Comore), and\n              M\n              .\n              aelleni\n              sp. n. has been found in northern and western Madagascar and the Comoros (Anjouan). In each case, these three clades were genetically divergent and monophyletic and the taxa are diagnosable based on different external and craniodental characters. One aspect that helped to define the systematics of this group was isolation of DNA from one of the paratypes of\n              M. manavi\n              collected in 1896 and new topotypic material.\n              Miniopterus manavi\n              is most closely allied to a recently described species,\n              M. petersoni\n              .

In defining and resolving the systematics of cryptic species, such as miniopterid bats, the process of defining clades with molecular tools, segregating the specimens accordingly, and identifying corroborative morphological characters has been notably efficient.",

Two visits per season were made over the course of two years, dry season (September 2014 and 2015) and rainy season (January 2015 and 2016). Individuals of this species were trapped when exiting the cave after dusk or entering before dawn. Animals were aged, sexed, and then individually marked before being released. In total, 271 adult males and 289 adult females were captured. Although some overlap was found in measurement ranges, males showed significantly larger mean forearm length and body mass than females, including separate analyses of the four different capture periods and in the combined season dataset. For the September 2015 visit, for which a considerable number of adults of both sexes were captured at dusk and dawn, animals entering the cave before dawn were significantly heavier in body mass than those exiting after dusk. When body mass data were pooled within a season, significant differences were found between the rainy and dry seasons in males, as well as females, indicating fluctuating aspects. Further analyses of intra-season and inter-season showed differences in body mass, presumably associated with the availability of fruit resources. Further, the sex ratios of captured individuals were not equal during different capture sessions and inferences are presented on aspects of the breeding biology of this species.",

Variable, temporary response to topical ocular antibiotic-corticosteroid therapy occurred. Histopathology of a conjunctival biopsy was consistent with allergic conjunctivitis. The bat was treated systemically with antihistamines and topically with an ocular antibiotic-corticosteroid combination for acute episodes of conjunctivitis. Pruritus, severe alopecia of the head and neck, and moist dermatitis later developed in conjunction with bilateral conjunctivitis. Cytology and histopathology of affected skin supported a diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. Although the assay was not validated for P. vampyrus, serum immunoglobulin E levels against multiple possible antigens were measured. Acceptable resolution of clinical signs was achieved for 20 mo following systemic cyclosporine administration. Cyclosporine levels were measured in whole blood for additional therapeutic monitoring. This is the ﬁrst reported case of histopathologic support for atopic dermatitis, novel diagnostics, and palliative management of atopy using cyclosporine in a ﬂying fox.",

Here we report polydactyly in the foliage-roosting phyllostomid Artibeus lituratus, in the southern Pantanal ﬂoodplain and adjacent uplands, Brazil. Bats were mist-netted in six populations, and capture rate per population was estimated. Of 444 A. lituratus individuals sampled, one female and one male exhibited supernumerary toes. These cases occurred in the two densest populations, in sites where forests are distributed in small disconnected fragments. This situation could favour increased inbreeding in A. lituratus and, indirectly, the manifestation of polydactyly.",

            "abstractNote": "The mysterious predator–­prey interaction between bats and nocturnally migrating birds is a very rare and incredible process in natural ecosystems. So far only three avivorous bat species, including two noctule bats (Nyctalus lasiopterus and Nyctalus aviator) and the great evening bat (Ia io), are known to regularly prey on songbirds during nocturnal avian migration. The information related to the diversity and the characteristics of the birds as prey and the hunting strategy in both species of noctule bats are already clear. However, the diversity of bird prey in the diet of I. io as confirmed by molecular identification remains unknown. Moreover, like hunting insects, it remains unclear whether the avivorous bats opportunistically prey on birds. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding to investigate the bird prey composition, diversity, and choice in diets of I. io. We found I. io consumed 22 species of seven families from Passeriformes with a body mass of 6–­19 g, and preferentially selected small-­sized passerine birds for optimizing the benefit/risk trade-­off. Moreover, most of the species preyed upon were migratory birds, while four species were local resident birds, indicating that I. io may adopt both aerial-­hawking and gleaning strategies on songbirds as do the other two noctules. Further, I. io body mass did not influence in prey choice and predation richness on birds, suggesting I. io is an opportunistic avivorous predator. This study provides novel insights into the avian dietary ecology of I. io and completes the analysis of predator/prey interaction between three avivorous bats and nocturnally migrating birds. Our results also indicate bat predation on birds which occurs as an act of ecological opportunity may subject bats to intense natural selection pressure, causing them access to the new diet-­defined adaptive zones.",

            "abstractNote": "Histoplasma capsulatum was sampled in lungs from 87 migratory Tadarida brasiliensis bats captured in Mexico (n=66) and Argentina (n=21). The fungus was screened by nested-PCR using a sensitive and speciﬁc Hcp100 gene fragment. This molecular marker was detected in 81.6% [95 % conﬁdence interval (CI) 73.4–89.7] of all bats, representing 71 ampliﬁed bat lung DNA samples. Data showed a T. brasiliensis infection rate of 78.8 % (95 % CI 68.9–88.7) in bats captured in Mexico and of 90.4% (95 % CI 75.2–100) in those captured in Argentina. Similarity with the H. capsulatum sequence of a reference strain (G-217B) was observed in 71 Hcp100 sequences, which supports the fungal ﬁndings. Based on the neighbour-joining and maximum parsimony Hcp100 sequence analyses, a high level of similarity was found in most Mexican and all Argentinean bat lung samples. Despite the fact that 81.6% of the infections were molecularly evidenced, only three H. capsulatum isolates were cultured from all samples tested, suggesting a low fungal burden in lung tissues that did not favour fungal isolation. This study also highlighted the importance of using diﬀerent tools for the understanding of histoplasmosis epidemiology, since it supports the presence of H. capsulatum in T. brasiliensis migratory bats from Mexico and Argentina, thus contributing new evidence to the knowledge of the environmental distribution of this fungus in the Americas.",

We show that in\n              C. perspicillata\n              bats, males are more likely to produce distress vocalizations than females when hand-held. Male bats call more, their calls are louder, harsher (faster amplitude modulated) and cover lower carrier frequencies than female vocalizations. We discuss our results within a framework of potential hormonal, neurobiological and behavioural differences that could explain our findings, and open multiple paths to continue the study of sex-related differences in vocal behaviour in bats.",

Herein we describe a new species of endemic bat from southern Madagascar, Miniopterus griﬃthsi sp. n., which is the sister taxa to Miniopterus gleni, a taxon described in 1995 (holotype from Sarodrano, just north of the Onilahy River in the southwest). Based on current information, M. griﬃthsi is found in the sub-arid bioclimatic zone, south of the Onilahy River, and M. gleni occurs in a variety of diﬀerent bioclimatic zones, north of the Onilahy River to the northern portion of the island and on the near shore island of Ile Sainte Marie. The realization that M. griﬃthsi was a separate entity was ﬁrst based on phylogeographic studies of the M. gleni complex. Comparisons using 397 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome b found a divergence of 1.2% within animals occurring across much of Madagascar north of the Onilahy River, 0.07% in those south of the Onilahy River, and 7.4% in populations separated by this river. Subsequently, morphological characters were identiﬁed that supported the speciﬁc separation of populations occurring south (M. griﬃthsi) and north of the Onilahy River (M. gleni), which include tragus shape, pelage coloration, and skull proportions.",

            "abstractNote": "In some bats, a noseleaf is thought to help focus echolocation calls emitted through the nostrils. I studied the ontogenetic mode of the rhinarial cartilages and the associated facial muscles to assess how these rhinarial infrastructures interact with the noseleaf, and the inferred function of such a rhinarial complex. This study focuses on developmental stages of <i>Hipposideros diadema</i> and <i>Lavia frons</i>. Based on new data on these two rhinolophoids and a review of former studies concerning rhinopomatids, rhinolophoids and phyllostomids, the functional and phylogenetic implications of the rhinarial complex among leaf-nosed Microchiroptera are evaluated by the current study. Nasal emitting forms evolved several times independently in the Microchiroptera and share various features, irrespective of their phylogenetic position: the nostrils lie dorsally; the noseleaf has a well-developed horseshoe-shaped plate; the cartilago cupularis bears a large processus cupularis; M(iv) is extended on the lateral plate of the processus alaris superior. The unique similarities of the ontogenetic process of the nasal ‘resonators’ support the assumption that the rhinolophids + megadermatids and rhinopomatids may represent a natural group. In some features, the rhinolophids + megadermatids differ significantly from the phyllostomids. The noseleaf has a median flap and anterior-facing pockets. The processus alaris superior is half-tube-shaped or included in the lateral wall of the cupula nasi anterior. The cartilago accessoria and the attendant musculature perform an important function for supporting and moving the noseleaf. Similar emission of the echolocation pulses but alternative constructional designs of the external nose structures suggest that a separate history of rhinolophoids and phyllostomids might account for these differences.",

The former European bat species\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    was split into two,\n                    Pipistrelus pipistrellus\n                    s.s. and\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    , over 20 years ago. However, their distribution, breeding and winter ranges as well as migratory status in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus remained obscure.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  In our study, we scrutinised records of both species and assessed the sex ratio during their breeding season in this region.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We show that\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    s.s. has a significantly smaller range than previously assumed, being restricted to the southern part of the study area. On the contrary,\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    has a broader distribution, covering the Caucasus and Eastern Europe, up to ca. 59° N. Hence, all historical records and long‐distance movements of\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    sensu lato from Eastern Europe within the inferred allopatric occurrence of\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    should be attributed to\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    The high portion of adult males in breeding localities, mass wintering within the breeding range and lacking evidence of long‐distance seasonal movements imply that\n                    Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n                    s.s. is a sedentary species. In\n                    Pipistrelus pygmaeus\n                    , the sex ratio among adults during the breeding season varies latitudinally. The female‐biased sex ratio, absence of mass wintering and the historical long‐distance recoveries of ringed individuals suggest that this species is migratory in Eastern Europe. The male‐biased sex ratio during the breeding season, along with late autumn records, suggests that the Caucasus represents its winter range.",

As the study was carried out in a landscape that was profoundly altered by industrial forestry, we predicted that in a better preserved landscape this species would select smaller feeding areas located at closer distances from the roost, according to the optimal foraging theory, and would use almost exclusively the preferred habitat, i.e., native deciduous woodland. To test these hypotheses, we radiotracked 14 R. euryale from the largest known breeding colony of northern Iberian Peninsula and determined their habitat selection, spatial foraging pattern, and hunting behaviour. Our predictions on habitat selection, as well as on the foraging site size and on commuting range were confirmed. Rhinolophus euryale used almost exclusively native deciduous woodland, and hedgerows were positively selected. We suggest that the richness of tree species in hedgerows provides a high prey availability sustained in time and space. Our findings show that habitat disturbance constitutes a major cause of decline for R. euryale in the study area.",

Simultaneously, we\nused Malaise traps to determine prey availability in different habitats, weighting\nit according to the habitat use of bats. Prey categories found in droppings\nwere then compared to availability to perform the selection analysis. The\nmain consumed prey were by far small lepidopterans (5-11 mm long), followed\nby tipulids, and scarabaeid beetles (entirely\n              Rhizotrogus\n              sp.). Moths and\nbeetles were selected positively, whereas the other categories were underrepresented\nin the diet.

            "abstractNote": "In a Geoffroy's bat Myotis emarginatus colony in central Iberia, we investigated the foraging behaviour of six lactating females by means of radio-tracking and the diet of 23 individuals by faecal analysis. The bats preferred to forage mainly in pine plantations, riparian woodland, and scrubland, whereas native dehesa (a loose semi-natural oak Quercus rotundifolia and Q. suber woodland) was not exploited as expected. By far the most important prey type for this bat in the Mediterranean were spiders. We conclude that Geoffroy's bat prefers to forage in multistratified dense habitats, even if these include nonnative plantations. The vertical structuring and especially high cover, along with the combination of both parameters are important for this highly manoeuvrable, clutter-tolerant bat. This is valid even when the vertical component is much reduced as occurs in scrubland, in the first succession steps to woodland creation, and in degraded conditions. Under such circumstances, aerial weaving spiders might be detected and captured when lying in their webs. It is likely that dehesa is too loosely wooded to offer suitable characteristics for orb-weaving aerial spiders to build webs, and thus it may not be as attractive for M emarginatus as more dense habitats.",

Currently, this disease is spreading in rural and urban areas of non-endemic regions in Brazil. Recently, bats have gained epidemiological signiﬁcance in leishmaniasis due to its close relationship with human settlements. In this study, we investigated the presence of Leishmania spp. DNA in blood samples from 448 bats belonging to four families representing 20 species that were captured in the Triangulo Mineiro and Alto Paranaiba areas of Minas Gerais State (non-endemic areas for leishmaniasis), Brazil. Leishmania spp. DNA was detected in 8·0% of the blood samples, 41·6% of which were Leishmania infantum, 38·9% Leishmania amazonensis and 19·4% Leishmania braziliensis. No positive correlation was found between Leishmania spp. and bat food source. The species with more infection rates were the insectivorous bats Eumops perotis; 22·2% (4/18) of which tested positive for Leishmania DNA. The presence of Leishmania in the bat blood samples, as observed in this study, represents epidemiological importance due to the absence of Leishmaniasis cases in the region.",

They were laparatomized for evaluation of macroscopic characteristics and the digestive tube segments were collected for fixation in 10% neutral formalin for histological processing, after 48 h of fixation. Macroscopically, the digestive tube had an oesophageal segment in the abdominal cavity, with a J-s­ haped saccular stomach, in addition to a small intestine divided into duodenum, jejunum-i­leum and terminal ileum. In the large intestine, an organ dilatation was observed from the small intestine with a one-w­ ay oral-­ aboral ending in the anus, which was called the descending colon. Morphological similarity of the walls of all segments with those of other mammals was observed; however, it presented some peculiarities such as the absence of oesophageal glands, Brunner in the intestine, cecum and appendages. The anatomical disposition and tissue pattern were similar to that found in other insectivorous species. The adaptations of the digestive tube of this species are possibly due to the insectivorous feeding habits, which can be impacted due to anthropic actions in foraging environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Many viruses that cause serious and often fatal disease in humans have spilled over from bats. Recent evidence suggests that stress may enhance virus shedding by bats increasing the possibility of transmission to other species. To understand the reasons for spillover is therefore important to determine the molecular pathways that link stress to virus reactivation and shedding in bats. We recently isolated and characterized a gammaherpesvirus (Eptesicus fuscus herpesvirus, EfHV) autochthonous to North American big brown bats. Since herpesviruses are known to reactivate from latent infections in response to a wide variety of stressors, EfHV presents us with an opportunity to study how physiological, behavioural or environmental changes may influence the big brown bats’ relationship with EfHV. To understand the biology of the virus and how the extended periods of torpor experienced by these bats during hibernation along with the stress of arousal might influence the virus‐host relationship, we attempted to detect the virus in the blood of wild‐caught nonhibernating bats as well as captive bats arising from hibernation. We compared the prevalence of EfHV in the blood (using PCR) and EfHV‐specific antibodies (using ELISA) between captive hibernating bats and wild‐caught non‐hibernating bats. We detected EfHV only in the blood of captive hibernating bats (27.8% = 10/36) and not in wild‐caught non‐hibernating bats (0.0% = 0/43). In contrast, the EfHV‐specific antibody titres were higher in the non‐hibernating bats compared to the hibernating bats. Our study suggests that: (a) viral DNA in blood indicates reactivation from latency, (b) long periods of hibernation lead to suppression of immunity, (c) stress of arousal from hibernation reactivates the virus in bats with lower levels of anti‐viral immunity (indicated by humoral immune response), and (d) levels of anti‐viral immunity increase in non‐hibernating bats following reactivation.",

The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites.\n            \n            \n              2\n              Hand pollination experiments showed\n              S. siamensis\n              to be partially self‐incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit.\n            \n            \n              3\n              Shorea siamensis\n              was pollinated by small\n              Trigona\n              bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites.\n            \n            \n              4\n              At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected.\n            \n            \n              5\n              Our results suggest that high reproductive success of\n              S. siamensis\n              is dependent upon cross‐pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population density. The implications of these results for population recovery and genetic structure following disturbance are discussed.",

The internal nasal skeleton of Pteropus lacks a rostral nasoturbinal and includes a caudal nasoturbinal that corresponds to the ossified crista semicircularis of the fetus; three endoturbinals; one ectoturbinal; the maxilloturbinal; and a low basal crest that may represent a rudimentary element. We describe in detail the structure and connections of these elements in Pteropus. The maxilloturbinal is the largest element. In cross section, the caudal nasoturbinal is unilaminar, the maxilloturbinal is double bilaminar (i.e., each of the basal twin laminae splits further into two secondary laminae), and the other elements range from incipient to asymmetrically double bilaminar (i.e., one branch simple, the other split). all turbinals of the ethmoidal labyrinth contribute to the cribriform plate, creating a specific pattern of cribriform foramina. The elements found in Pteropus are compared with those of other well-known mammals with relatively few turbinal elements, including other bats, primates, canids, and marsupials. We show that, despite terminological discrepancies across studies, homologies are straightforward to establish among these taxa and so comparative or phylogenetic studies may benefit from inclusion of turbinal characters.",

Although some aspects of emergence behavior are understood, one previously unexplored area is the specific order in which individuals emerge. The goal of our research was to determine if big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, fitted with passive integrated transponder tags emerge from roosts in buildings each evening in a nonrandom order. We assessed relative and absolute order of emergence to determine if order is concordant across nights and whether individuals consistently emerge in close association with specific roost mates. We found significant concordance in rank order among nights at all roosts. At 5 roosts concordance decreased as time between dates increased. Association rates between individuals were low, and temporal analyses revealed that associations rapidly degraded over time, indicating that bats do not emerge each evening consistently with the same group of roost mates. We discuss how social structure, information transfer, and/or individual energetic needs could be responsible for the observed nonrandom patterns of emergence. Our results suggest that emergence order represents behavioral information that traditionally has been overlooked and that might be useful for characterizing aspects of the ecology and social behavior of bats and other species with cryptic behavior.",

In this work, we analyzed the geographic and potential distribution of a poorly known species of South American bat. As a tool, environmental niche modeling has been used to study the distributional patterns of species and more recently, taxonomic boundaries of cryptic species. We used MaxEnt v 3.3.e, Worldclim database and a vegetation map, covering the entire area of species’ occurrence. We registered 64 localities from Argentina (43), Chile (10), Peru (8) and Bolivia (5). We divided recording localities in different datasets according to several taxonomic schemes, and analyzed potential distribution models separately (i.e., all known records; Argentina-Chile; Peru) in five different models. Models including all known localities showed a disjoint distribution, with two basic core areas of high predictive values, one in NW Argentina and another in southern Chile and SW Argentina separated by the South American Arid Diagonal. A third area appeared in Atacama and Sechura deserts in the models that included Peruvian and Bolivian localities. Model including only Peruvian localities showed the opposite pattern, with high predictive values only in arid environments from southern Peru. We interpreted that localities correctly assigned to H. macrotus belong to a taxonomic complex distributed in two contrasting areas, each one inhabited by a different taxon: 1) Bolivia and NW Argentina and 2) S and central Chile and SW Argentina. Given the systematic uncertainty of Histiotus, these two forms might be sister species or may not share an immediate common ancestor within the genus. Further, we consider that the specimens from localities referred to H. macrotus from southern Peru should be revised. These alternatives await a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis of Histiotus.",

They are highly diverse, with physiological and behavioral adaptations which allow them to extend their distributions into temperate areas. In Patagonia, this family is represented by seven species in three genera (Histiotus, Lasiurus and Myotis). In this study, we analyzed the distribution of two vespertilionid species, Lasiurus villosissimus and Myotis dinellii, including new southernmost records, and their relationship with environmental variables. Two different spatial scales were analyzed: a continental approach for species distribution analyses (South America), and local trapping of bats in northwestern Chubut province, Argentina. We present new southern limits for L. villosissimus and M. dinellii, and included new records for Patagonian bats. The big hoary bat L. villosissimus was recorded as the largest bat inhabiting Patagonia, relating it as a bat mainly inhabiting low, humid and temperate/warm areas. The little yellow bat M. dinellii, instead, is the smallest mammal and the smallest bat recorded in Patagonia to date, related mainly with dry, mid-altitude and temperate/warm areas.",

However, the presence of cryptic strategies often results in situations where social mating system is not reflective of genetic mating system. We present such a study of the genetic mating system of a harem-forming bat Cynopterus sphinx where harems may not be true indicators of male reproductive success. This temporal study using data from six seasons on paternity reveals that social harem assemblages do not play a role in the mating system, and variance in male reproductive success is lower than expected assuming polygynous mating. Further, simulations reveal that the genetic mating system is statistically indistinguishable from promiscuity. Our results are in contrast to an earlier study that demonstrated high variance in male reproductive success. Although an outcome of behavioural mating patterns, standardized variance in male reproductive success (Im) affects the opportunity for sexual selection. To gain a better understanding of the evolutionary implications of promiscuity for mammals in general, we compared our estimates of Im and total opportunity for sexual selection (Im ⁄ If, where If is standardized variance in female reproductive success) with those of other known promiscuous species. We observed a broad range of Im ⁄ If values across known promiscuous species, indicating our poor understanding of the evolutionary implications of promiscuous mating.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are social animals and display a diverse variety of mating and social systems, with most species exhibiting some form of polygyny. Their social organization is fluid and individuals frequently switch partners and roosting sites. While harem-like social organization is observed in multiple tropical species, its importance is contested in many of them. In this study, we investigated the role of harems in the social organization of the old world fruit bat\n              Cynopterus sphinx\n              . Based on regular behavioural observations over a period of 20 months and genetic data from microsatellite markers, we observed that the social organization is flexible, individuals regularly shift between roosts and the social organization resembles a fission–fusion society. Behavioural and genetic analyses suggest that the harems are not strict units of social structure, and the colony does not show signatures of subdivision with harems as behavioural units. We also observed that there was no correlation between individuals with high association index and pairwise relatedness. Our findings indicate that similar to the mating system, the social organization of\n              C. sphinx\n              can also be categorized as a fission–fusion society, and hence the term ‘harem’ is a misnomer. We conclude that the social system of\n              C. sphinx\n              is flexible, with multi-male multi-female organization, and individuals tend to be loyal to a given area rather than a roost.",

About 153000 flying foxes were counted at 12 major camps. These data are compared with historical data and the status of the species in Australia is discussed. The imperative for conservation management of the Spectacled Flying Fox is emphasized regardless of its official conservation status, particularly in relation to seed dispersal and pollination of rainforest plants. The most important component of this management must be the development of non-lethal deterrence at orchards followed by the development of methods for countering tick paralysis. Further annual censuses will be necessary to monitor population trends in comparison with me current baseline. This initial census was conducted as part of an integrated approach to Spectacled Flying Fox management by fruit growers, researchers, conservation groups and the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.",
