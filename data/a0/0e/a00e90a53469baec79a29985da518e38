These include disturbance to the bats, which limits the frequency with which captures can be made at an individual capture site, and potentially alters the behaviors being studied. Infrared video monitoring, passive acoustic recording and automated analysis and identification of bat calls offers an alternative set of noninvasive methods for monitoring bats. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of acoustic monitoring in comparison with capture-­based and video monitoring of seasonal swarming behavior among several species of Myotis bats in southern Britain. We applied these complementary approaches to describe seasonal, overnight, and species-­specific variation in swarming behavior in a multispecies community of Myotis bats. We show that the three monitoring approaches have advantages and disadvantages for different tasks, but can be viewed as highly complementary methods for addressing different types of research questions. In our study of swarming behavior, capture and examination of bats in the hand was necessary for measuring sex ratios, reproductive status, and even for confirmation of species identification for some difficult to separate taxa. Capture is also an essential aspect of tagging bats for individual identification and tracking studies. Video monitoring is useful for understanding the behavior of bats at swarming sites, and measuring the flux of individuals into and out of roosting or swarming sites. Passive acoustic monitoring is a valuable noninvasive method for continuous monitoring of within-­night, seasonal, and between-­year variation in the abundance of bat calls. These can be used as an index of variation in relative abundance within—­but not between—­bat species.",

We captured eight individuals of this species during surveys in Copia Nature Reserve in northwestern Vietnam and two individuals from East Khasi Hills and East Jaintia Hills districts of Meghalaya state, northeastern India. They are described here as the first records for Vietnam and India. We also provide comparative mensural data including the holotype and other specimens from Southeast Asia. The record of M. altarium from Meghalaya significantly extends the westward distribution range of this species beyond Thailand. Our study affirms previous observations of the cave dwelling habits of M. altarium and suggests that this species temporarily hibernates during cold winter periods in Vietnam. It is also suggested that its ­distribution range may encompass other karstic habitats in the mainland Indomalayan region.",

The aim of this study was to produce a set of repeatable quantitative reference measurements that could be used to assess the cardiac size during radiographic examination of this species. Ventro-dorsal and lateral radiographs (n ¼ 129) from a total of 42 individual Livingstone’s fruit bats were examined. The control group radiographs (n ¼ 102) consisted of 34 healthy individuals. Radiographic measurements were taken of structures within the thorax and then converted into ratios. These ratios from radiographs (n ¼ 27) were also calculated for eight individuals with diagnosed cardiomyopathy. Vertebral Heart Scores (VHS) were calculated from right lateral radiographs and compared between the two groups. From all the data, only the width of the cardiac silhouette to the width of the thorax (the W : T ratio) in the ventro-dorsal view and the VHS were found to be signiﬁcantly different between both groups (P , 0.05). The group with cardiomyopathies had a mean W : T ratio of 0.59 (60.005) and a VHS of 9.77 (60.89), while a mean W : T ratio of 0.54 (60.004) and a VHS of 8.71 (60.93) was established for healthy specimens.",

Five bat species were found to hibernate in the tunnel: Daubentons bat (Myotis daubentonii), pond bat (Myotis dasycneme), brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), barbastelle bat (Barbastella barbastellus), and serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus). It was established that about 130 bats roost in the hibernation site every year, Daubentons bats constituting 72% of them. That is the largest known hibernating cluster of Daubentons bats in southeastern Lithuania. The Paneriai tunnel is protected as an engineering monument. It is recommended that the tunnel should be granted the status of a bat reserve.",

Juveniles were captured in mist nets as they foraged in different microhabitats that were defined and quantified using \"clutter indices\" ranging from 0 (least cluttered) to 5 (most cluttered). I analyzed fecal samples from captured individuals to assess diet. Chi-squared analyses showed that there was a significant difference in habitat use and diet among juveniles captured in early, mid, and late July. Juveniles with smaller wings foraged in the least cluttered habitats, whereas juveniles with larger wings foraged in habitats with a high degree of clutter. Juveniles with larger wings were captured in all microhabitats, whereas those with smaller wings were captured predominantly in open microhabitats. Juveniles with relatively higher aspect ratios and lower wing loadings used a greater diversity of habitats than those with lower aspect ratios and higher wing loadings. In addition, differences in diet were significant and correlated with wing size. My results suggest resource partitioning between juveniles as a function of wing size. These data have important implications regarding how relative size among juveniles may effect intraspecific structuring of populations.",

It differs from its morphologically closest cogener, Anenterotrema mesolecitha, in having smaller eggs, a much larger cirrus sac, and in the position of ovary. This is the sixth species of this genus and ﬁrst to be described from Peru and C. brevicauda. KEY WORDS: Anenterotrema iannaconei n. sp., Digenea, Anenterotrematidae, Carollia brevicauda, Peru.",

Manipulation of landscape by BTPDs increases plant and animal diversity in grasslands, and thus BTPDs are considered ecosystem engineers. If BTPD colonies induce increases in insect diversity in the eastern foothills of Colorado, as shown for other areas, it stands to reason that insectivorous bats may respond by increasing their activity in those areas. I tested this hypothesis in the north-eastern foothills habitat of Colorado, USA, by surveying for echolocation calls within four BTPD colonies and adjacent reference sites lacking BTPD burrows. Results show that bats were signiﬁcantly more active in BTPD colonies than at adjacent reference sites. In addition, of the nine resident bat species, small-footed myotis (Myotis ciliolabrum) showed the most consistent relationship with BTPD colonies. Other species that were more active in BTPD colonies included little brown myotis (M. lucifugus), fringed myotis (M. thysanodes), big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), and hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus). The typically forest-edge adapted species, M. ciliolabrum, and M. thysanodes a forest-adapted specialist, were active more than expected in treeless BTPD colonies indicating the BTPD colonies are providing a resource not present outside colony perimeters. This study provides the ﬁrst evidence of a relationship between BTPD colonies and bats in western North America.",

Serological, parasitological, and molecular surveys among wild and domestic animals in the Corrego do Veado Biological Reserve, which is an Atlantic Rainforest fragment in the state of Espõ´rito Santo, southeastern Brazil, were evaluated. In total, 154 wild animals of 25 species and 67 domestic animals (47 dogs and 20 horses) were sampled. All the domestic animals were serologically negative for anti-Leishmania infantum chagasi antibodies and negative in parasitological approaches. Only the Order Chiroptera presented positive blood cultures and cryopreserved isolates. The phylogenetic trees based on SSU rDNA and gGAPDH genes conÞrmed the occurrence of Trypanosoma dionisii and provided the Þrst record of Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei in southeastern Brazil. The studies conducted in Atlantic Rainforest remaining trees provide the knowledge of parasite diversity or detect parasites that can accelerate the loss of hosts diversity.",

            "abstractNote": "Blood-feeding arthropods play a major role in the transmission of several ﬂaviviruses, which represent an important problem for human health. Currently, dengue is one of the most important arboviral emerging diseases worldwide. Furthermore, some previous studies have reported the presence of viral nucleic acids and antibodies against dengue virus (DENV) in wild animals. Our knowledge of the role played by wildlife reservoirs in the sylvatic transmission and maintenance of DENV remains limited. Our objective was to screen blood-feeding ectoparasites (bat ﬂies) and their common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) hosts, for ﬂaviviruses in Hidalgo, Mexico. We detected Flavivirus sequences in 38 pools of ectoparasites (Diptera: Streblidae, Strebla wiedemanni and Trichobius parasiticus) and 8 tissue samples of D. rotundus by RT-PCR and semi-nested PCR using FlaviPF1S, FlaviPR2bis, and FlaviPF3S primers speciﬁc for NS5, a gene highly conserved among ﬂaviviruses. Phylogenetic inference analysis performed using the maximum likelihood algorithm implemented in PhyML showed that six sequences clustered with DENV (bootstrap value = 53.5%). Although this study supports other reports of DENV detection in bats and arthropods other than Aedes mosquitoes, the role of these ectoparasitic ﬂies and of hematophagous bats in the epidemiology of DENV still warrants further investigation.",

            "abstractNote": "The current investigation described the ultrastructural and histological features of the lingual papillary system in 14 adult Rhinopoma hardwickii using scanning electron and light microscopy, and immunohistochemical staining of keratin. Three types of lingual papillae were recognized; one filiform mechanical and two gustatory (fungiform and circumvallate) of three directions: posterior, posteromedian, and median. Five filiform papillae subtypes were observed in four regions. The lingual tip had numerous giant filiform papillae. The lingual root was divided into two regions, an anterior papillary and a posterior non-papillary region that had only three circumvallate papillae in a triangular pattern. Histologically, the papillae exhibited detached thick keratin that spread over the dorsal epithelial surface. The dorsal surface of the root had stratified keratinized circumvallate papillae. Concerning the pan-cytokeratin (CK) antibody staining, moderate CK expression was observed in the superficial corneal layer of the apical lingual mucosa. While the superficial corneal cell layer in both body and root exhibited increasing of CK antibody. Morphometrically, there was a significantly increased, region-specific number of triangular, pointed filiform papillae, which were relatively increased in length and width. However, the round conical blunt filiform papillae and fungiform papillae were sparse. We concluded that our results showed distinguished adaptations in the lingual structure and its different papillae established on the nutritional and energetic demand of this bat species. This lingual adaptation is summarized in number, position, taste buds, direction, ultrastructural features, and histological that concerned with its ability in eating during the night flight.",

This study was conducted to describe the structural and functional adaptations of the retina of two bats very common in the Egyptian fauna having a different lifestyle: the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and insectivorous bat (Pipistrellus kuhlii). Seven eyes were collected from adult individuals of each species. Examination of the retina using a light microscope and a transmission electron microscope was carried out. The retina of P. kuhlii was thicker than that of R. aegyptiacus, which had many projections extended from the choroid layer into retina forming papillae. Despite rods being dominant in retinae of both species, cone photoreceptors were encountered in both retinae. The outer plexiform layer of R. aegyptiacus was arranged into islets between the outer nuclear layer produced differences in its thickness. However, the retina of P. kuhlii showed a normal arrangement of retinal structure. The retinal pigment epithelium of both bat species consists of a single layer of the cuboidal cells with a round to oval vesicular nuclei, which showed a lack of pigmentation in R. aegyptiacus and poor pigmentation in the P. kuhlii. In conclusion, our investigation detected many structural and ultrastructural differences between the two bat species. The presence of many projections protruded from the choroid layer of R. aegyptiacus retina is considered the most characteristic difference between the retinae of R. aegyptiacus and P. kuhlii.",

In this study, we aimed to characterize the functional and structural acclimations of the lenses of two common bats with a various lifestyle in the Egyptian environment: the insectivorous bat (IB) (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and Egyptian fruit bat (FB) (Rousettus aegyptiacus). From each species, seven lenses were extracted from adult eyes. The scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and light microscopic examination of the lens were carried out. FB lenses were made up primarily of fiber cells and sheets, which were encapsulated by a thin collagenous capsule and covered by single epithelial layer anteriorly. On the other hand, the IB lens had two poles and was visibly oval shaped. Both lenses had epithelial cells of the same cuboidal form that were subjected to continuous division and differentiation into new fiber cells at the center. SEM revealed that the normal FB lens had regularly organized shells of fiber cells of intact lens fibers which were connected by membrane interdigitations with different shapes mainly ball-and-socket junctions through the superficial cortical fiber cells. The IB lens was composed of parallel, evenly spaced fibers with various types of interdigitations between fibers that can be seen and increased close to the middle region revealing tiny bumps along the scrubby portions and sockets and balls in the center of the wide portions. Near the center of both lenses, there were large interlocking paddles with little and lengthy protrusions along their short sides. In conclusion, our study discovered several ultrastructural and structural variations among the investigated species. The detection of specialized membrane interdigitations with different shapes protruding from the lens fiber sheets is considered the most characteristic of the FB lens.",

Seminal vesicles of fortyeight bats were examined during the early rainy, late rainy and peak dry seasons, using gross anatomical, histological and ultrastructural techniques. The interlobular connective tissue septa from the external capsule demarcated the glandular parenchyma into numerous lobules of tubulo-alveolar glands. A simple cuboidal epithelium of mono- or bi-nucleated cuboidal cells lined the glandular mucosa during the rainy season. This was replaced by a bistratified cuboidal epithelium, whose upper layer of cells showed evidence of degeneration, during the dry season. The PAS-positive secretory products appeared to be numerous during the rainy season, but few and clumped together during the dry season. The mean gross weight, interlobular septal thickness, acini diameter and epithelial height of the glands varied significantly with season. Ultrastructural features of the secretory cells during the rainy season showed well-developed cytoplasmic organelles, numerous electron lucid secretory vesicles and electron-dense granules. Secretory epithelial cells of the seminal vesicles are very active during the rainy season, while regeneration of degenerated epithelium in preparation for the next reproductive cycle occurs during the dry season.",

            "abstractNote": "We studied the morphological characteristics and seasonal changes of the bulbourethral gland of Eidolon helvum in a typical African tropical environment. Fortyeight bulbourethral glands were examined using gross anatomical, histological, histochemical, and ultrastructural techniques during the early rainy, late rainy, and peak dry seasons. The pear-shaped bilateral bulbourethral glands were located extraabdominally in the inguinal region. Trabeculae from the capsule divided the parenchyma into numerous lobules of tubuloalveolar glandular acini. The mucosa was covered by a simple columnar epithelium consisting up of principal secretory cells, columnar dense cells and basal cells, which were progressively pronounced during the dry season. The principal cells contained eosinophilic granules, which were PAS positive while the dense cells did not show affinity for the stains. The mean gross weights, acini diameters, and epithelial heights were greater during the rainy season than the dry season. Ultrastructural evaluation showed that the cytoplasm of the principal cells contained well-developed Golgi complexes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and secretory vesicles of varying electron densities and sizes. The secretory vesicles were numerous during the early rainy season, decreased during the late rainy season and were scanty during the peak dry season. The simple columnar epithelium observed during the rainy season was replaced by an undefined stratified epithelium during the dry season, and this was associated with cellular degenerations and regenerations. In conclusion, E. helvum has a typical mammalian bulbourethral gland, with a unique cell type, the dense cell whose functions are not well-understood. The gland exhibits cyclical seasonal variation in structure and secretory activity; being active during the early rainy season (breeding season), and showing the lowest activity during the dry season (non-breeding season). Glandular epithelial cell renewal occurs during the dry season in preparation for the next breeding season.",

Hipposideros terasensis used the strategy of delayed embryonic development. Bats mated in autumn. Fertilized eggs implanted during the blastula stage, but remained dormant for as long as five months before developing. In male bats, concentrations of testosterone increased from baseline to peak (54.3 ± 4.7 ng/ml) in August, corresponding with spermatogenesis. For female bats, concentrations of progesterone increased to peak levels (27.2 ± 6.8 ng/ml) between February and April, before declining back to baseline after birth in June. Increase and decline coincided, respectively, with resumption of embryo development (March to May) and birth (May to June). Compared to other hibernating species or species with similar reproductive patterns, H. terasensis had similar reproductive quiescence and changes and regulation of reproductive hormones.",

We radiotracked 42 individuals at 2 sites in the Golﬁto Wildlife Refuge and 6 sites at Corcovado National Park, southwestern Costa Rica. Average home-range size of A. watsoni was the smallest recorded for a bat species (3.6 ha). Site, age, reproductive status, habitat, and season all had signiﬁcant effects on foraging ranges, but sex and population abundance did not. Bats from the most productive sites, such as primary forests, had smaller foraging ranges, and subadults ranged farther than adults. During the dry season, females in late pregnancy had the smallest foraging ranges of all, most likely as a result of ﬂight constraints imposed by the large fetus and an increase in fruit availability. Conversely, lactating females sampled during the early rainy season had among the largest foraging ranges. Males had signiﬁcantly smaller roosting ranges than females, and adult bats sampled from areas of low roost abundance and high population abundance had smaller roosting ranges. However, subadults appeared to be unaffected by such changes in resource abundance, perhaps because they often roost in unmodiﬁed leaves. Although differences in resource availability and competition were important in determining roosting-range size, these effects were concealed by effects of reproductive activities such as mating, pregnancy, and lactation. Reproductive condition, along with foraging and roosting resource abundance, were largely responsible for determining ranging patterns in A. watsoni, but factors inﬂuenced foraging- and roosting-range size in different ways.",

            "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT\n            This study uses Ki‐67 and doublecortin (DCX) immunohistochemistry to delineate potential neurogenic zones, migratory pathways, and terminal fields associated with adult neurogenesis in the brains of three microchiropterans. As with most mammals studied to date, the canonical subgranular and subventricular neurogenic zones were observed. Distinct labeling of newly born cells and immature neurons within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was observed in all species. A distinct rostral migratory stream (RMS) that appears to split around the medial aspect of the caudate nucleus was observed. These two rostral stream divisions appear to merge at the rostroventral corner of the caudate nucleus to turn and enter the olfactory bulb, where a large terminal field of immature neurons was observed. DCX immunolabeled neurons were observed mostly in the rostral neocortex, but a potential migratory stream to the neocortex was not identified. A broad swathe of newly born cells and immature neurons was found between the caudoventral division of the RMS and the piriform cortex. In addition, occasional immature neurons were observed in the amygdala and DCX‐immunopositive axons were observed in the anterior commissure. While the majority of these features have been found in several mammal species, the large number of DCX immunolabeled cells found between the RMS and the piriform cortex and the presence of DCX immunostained axons in the anterior commissure are features only observed in microchiropterans and insectivores to date. In the diphyletic scenario of chiropteran evolution, these observations align the microchiropterans with the insectivores. Anat Rec, 299:1548–1560, 2016. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

In this study we evaluate patterns of association and parentage to describe the mating system of the tentmaking bat Artibeus watsoni. During 16 consecutive months, we regularly surveyed 2 sites in southwestern Costa Rica and determined size, composition, and stability of social groups, and established patterns of parentage within roosts. We found female-biased, mixed-sex social groups formed by individuals located in several roosts within an area. Roosting associations were low (average across all sites: 31%), and the frequent changes between roosting partners suggests that males and females formed nonexclusive mating bonds, which was further supported by our ﬁnding that only 27% of young were sired by the male within a roosting group. Paternal sibships were only observed in 17% of dyads of young roosting together, indicating that few males copulated with .1 female of the roosting group during the mating season. However, paternal sibships were only observed in Golﬁto, which could be explained by greater group size and stability attributable to lower roost availability. Thus, our ﬁndings are consistent with a polygynandrous mating system (2 or several males sharing access to 2 or several females, and vice versa) in which males associated intermittently with females that frequently switched roosts, and where breeding opportunities for males seemed related to the defense of roosts, roosting territories, or both.",

We tested the hypothesis that big brown bats might opportunistically prey on moths by analyzing insect fragments in guano pellets from 30 individual bats (27 females and 3 males) captured while foraging in Fort Collins, Colorado, during May, late July–early August, and late September 2002. We found that bats sampled 17–20 May (n = 12 bats) had a high (81–83%) percentage of volume of lepidopterans in guano, with the remainder (17–19% volume) dipterans and no coleopterans. From 28 May–9 August (n = 17 bats) coleopterans dominated (74–98% volume). On 20 September (n = 1 bat) lepidopterans were 99% of volume in guano. Migratory miller moths (Euxoa auxiliaris) were unusually abundant in Fort Collins in spring and autumn of 2002 and are known agricultural pests as larvae (army cutworms), suggesting that seasonal dietary ﬂexibility in big brown bats has economic beneﬁts.",

On presentation, the animal was emaciated and moribund with disseminated, multifocal, depigmented and proliferative lesions on the wing membranes and skin of the neck. Histopathology revealed multiple, well‐circumscribed proliferative epidermal lesions with intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. A poxvirus was identified via transmission electron microscopy and next‐generation sequencing (NGS). Analysis of sequences obtained demonstrated 99% nucleotide identity to Pteropox virus strain Australia (GenBank KU980965).

While the populations in southeastern Africa have been studied, those from the other parts of its distribution range have not been known well. We assessed genetic and morphological variation among some African and Arabian populations including those previously not studied. The recovered phylogenetic pattern suggests the existence of three major evolutionary lineages in this species. One lineage comprising populations from Kenya and Tanzania could be attributed to the nominotypical subspecies, although it surprisingly included also the population from Ghana. The respective populations from Yemen and Gabon were represented by the other two lineages. The recently discovered population of C. afra from Gabon shows considerable external morphological variation and a certain degree of sexual size dimorphism. Two morphogroups, based mainly on overall skull size, could be identified among populations from West Africa, East Africa, and Arabia. The larger-sized group corresponded to the nominotypical form. The smaller-sized group could be split into two subgroups defined by the skull shape, comprising populations from northeast Africa and Arabia, and West Africa, respectively. Although these two morphological subgroups seemed to correspond to forms gallarum/nilosa and kummeri, these allocations were not corroborated by the molecular analyses. Given the comparatively large genetic distances in C. afra, taxonomic revisions of the southern Arabian and Central African forms are anticipated.",

In two highveld caves, mating and hibernating colonies were resident from January to the end of July, but only one cave was occupied for hibernating during the winter. In the cave selected for hibernation humidity was lower, and fluctuated more, than in the other cave. Temperature also fluctuated more, but tended to average lower, than in the unused cave. It appears that low temperature rather than high humidity determined the choice of a hibernating cave.",

We cultured psychrotolerant fungi from the external surface and faeces of live Deer Mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and from the intestinal contents of a single freshly killed P. maniculatus, overwintering in a white-nose syndrome positive bat hibernaculum and from adjacent summer forest in eastern Canada. A low diversity of psychrotolerant fungi was cultured from P. maniculatus compared with that found in previous studies of the mycoflora of bats and arthropods occupying bat hibernacula in the region. Although the grooming habits of P. maniculatus may reduce the accumulation of a diverse psychrotolerant fungal assemblage on their external surface, we demonstrate that active euthermic mammals in underground habitats can carry viable spores of psychrotolerant fungi, both externally and internally. Small rodents using cave habitats may also play a role in dispersing psychrotolerant fungi between caves and suitable low-temperature habitats (i.e., burrows) in adjacent forest.",

            "abstractNote": "Islands and insular biotas have been recognized as ideal models for studying adaptive radiations and evolutionary processes. In the present study we investigated the Jamaican fruit-eating bat, Artibeus jamaicensis from Cozumel Island, to evaluate the effect of ecological features on genetic diversity and structure across three different environments, semi-evergreen tropical forest, mangrove, and cenotes, using six microsatellite loci in 105 individuals. Genetic diversity was relatively high (forest HO = 0.693, HNei = 0.825; mangrove HO = 0.702, HNei = 0.710; cenotes HO = 0.695, HNei = 0.847). Pairwise genetic differentiation measures between localities were not significant and the overall level of differentiation was markedly low (FST = 0.009, G’ST = 0.088). Likewise, results showed that A. jamaicensis consists of one genetic group and relatedness among individuals was low. Results are concordant with our predictions that the island population will show high genetic diversity and null structure at the fine spatial scale examined. We conclude that ecological features like dispersal and generalist habits are the factors influencing population structure and genetic diversity of A. jamaicensis on the island, and that factors like the species polygynous mating system, female philopatry and male differential dispersal do not prevail in the island population. Cozumel Island is facing severe conservation problems, mainly from habitat perturbation, urbanization and introduction of exotic species, hence the present genetic information is of great value as a basis for future research and protection of the species.",

We captured a juvenile Hoary Bat in south-central New Hampshire during July of 2007 and monitored its roosting behavior for ten days and its foraging behavior for one night. The bat roosted with two other bats, which we presumed were its mother and sibling. These bats roosted exclusively in Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock Tree) and tended to roost near tree tops in the forest canopy. The radiotagged bat used at least six roost trees and changed roost location eight times during the ten-day observation period. Although roost-tree fidelity was low, all roost trees were located within a maximum circular area of 0.5 ha. The bat foraged over an estimated 156-ha area of mostly forest habitat (68%), with additional open habitats (15%) and wetlands (17%). These data are the first observations of roosting and foraging behaviors by the Hoary Bat in the northeastern region of its geographic range.",

This new species resembles L. carrikeri and L. yasuni in possessing a white venter, but is distinguishable from both by external and cranial characteristics. The new species is similar in size to L. carrikeri and L. schulzi. Lophostoma sp. nov. can be most easily recognized by its combination of white venter, postauricular patches connected by a thin line of pale hair to the white fur on the chest, elongated clitoris and swollen labia, less strongly developed lateral projection of mastoid processes, well-marked indentation on the lingual cingulum of the upper canine, well-developed P3, well-developed posterior lingual cusp on the cingulum of P4, and parastyle absent on M1 and M2. We present a dichotomous key for the genus Lophostoma and a map showing all the localities where white-bellied Lophostoma have been recorded.",

P. umbratus occurs in the Andean and costal mountain systems of Venezuela and Colombia. P. nigellus occurs along the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia. Both species are medium-sized members of the genus possessing confusing taxonomic histories that have never intersected. Four of the 21 recognized species of Platyrrhinus, among them P. umbratus, do not have their taxonomic identiﬁcation conﬁrmed by molecular analyses. We provide the ﬁrst genetic data (Cyt-b and ND2 sequences) for the species. Phylogenetic analyses including the new genetic data lead to the conclusion that P. umbratus and P. nigellus are conspeciﬁc. Through the use of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM), we conﬁrm that P. umbratus and P. nigellus share high morphometric and environmental similarities. Based on such integrative approach, we regard P. nigellus as a junior synonym of P. umbratus. We provide an emended diagnosis of P. umbratus (subsuming P. nigellus) and draw morphological comparisons with other species of the genus with which it is sympatric. The conservation status of P. umbratus needs to be determined. The high rate of habitat destruction in the tropical Andes may soon cause P. umbratus to be reassigned to the Near-Threatened (NT) category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",

Caused by the psychrophilic fungus Geomyces destructans, WNS specifically affects bats during hibernation. We describe temperature-dependent growth performance and morphology for six independent isolates of G. destructans from North America and Europe. Thermal performance curves for all isolates displayed an intermediate peak with rapid decline in performance above the peak. Optimal temperatures for growth were between 12.5 and 15.8°C, and the upper critical temperature for growth was between 19.0 and 19.8°C. Growth rates varied across isolates, irrespective of geographic origin, and above 12°C all isolates displayed atypical morphology that may have implications for proliferation of the fungus. This study demonstrates that small variations in temperature, consistent with those inherent of bat hibernacula, affect growth performance and physiology of G. destructans, which may influence temperature-dependent progression and severity of WNS in wild bats.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is causing signiﬁcant declines in populations of North American hibernating bats, and recent western and southern expansions of the disease have placed additional species at risk. Understanding differences in species susceptibility and identifying management actions to reduce mortality of bats from WNS are top research priorities. However, the use of wild-caught susceptible bats, such as Myotis lucifugus, as model species for WNS research is problematic and places additional pressure on remnant populations. We investigated the feasibility of using Tadarida brasiliensis, a highly abundant species of bat that tolerates captivity, as the basis for an experimental animal model for WNS. Using methods previously established to conﬁrm the etiology of WNS in M. lucifugus, we experimentally infected 11 T. brasiliensis bats with Pseudogymnoascus destructans in the laboratory under conditions that induced hibernation. We detected P. destructans on all 11 experimentally infected bats, 7 of which exhibited localized proliferation of hyphae within the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue, similar to invasive cutaneous ascomycosis observed in M. lucifugus bats with WNS. However, the distribution of lesions across wing membranes of T. brasiliensis bats was limited, and only one discrete “cupping erosion,” diagnostic for WNS, was identiﬁed. Thus, the rarity of lesions deﬁnitive for WNS suggests that T. brasiliensis does not likely represent an appropriate model for studying the pathophysiology of this disease. Nonetheless, the results of this study prompt questions concerning the potential for free-ranging, migratory T. brasiliensis bats to become infected with P. destructans and move the fungal pathogen between roost sites used by species susceptible to WNS.",

Seed production is one possible point of recruitment failure, and one that the spatial arrangement of trees may affect.We sampled 118 Eucalyptus microcarpa (Myrtaceae) trees to compare and analyse the determinants of seed production in this dominant tree of modiﬁed, fragmented temperate grassy woodlands, which extend over much of southeastern Australia. Fecundity was estimated as the seed crop measured on leaf mass and whole tree bases and was compared between categories of tree conﬁguration.We also modelled fecundity using boosted regression trees, a new and ﬂexible tool. Fecundity on a leaf mass basis was predominantly inﬂuenced by environmental factors (topographic ‘wetness’, slope, soil type), rather than by local tree density and conﬁguration. Fewer seed per unit leaf mass were produced on ﬂat and topographically wet sites, reﬂecting poor tolerance of waterlogging by E. microcarpa. By contrast, whole tree fecundity was little inﬂuenced by environmental factors. Local tree density and conﬁguration did inﬂuence whole tree fecundity, which was high in solitary and woodland-spaced trees and reduced under high local density. We found little evidence for reduced fecundity of E. microcarpa in solitary trees. This points to the importance of scattered trees as sources of seed for tree recruitment and for natural regeneration of landscape level tree cover. Considerable uncertainty remains in modelled seed supply, and may be reduced with sampling across multiple years and greater environmental and spatial domains.",

Insectivorous bats in temperate regions are faced with the challenge of building up fat reserves vital for hibernation during a period of decreasing arthropod abundances. According to optimal foraging theory, prehibernating bats should adopt a less selective feeding behaviour –yet empirical studies have revealed many apparently generalized species to be composed of specialist individuals. Targeting the diet of the bat Myotis daubentonii, we used a combination of molecular techniques to test for seasonal changes in prey selectivity and individual-level variation in prey preferences. DNA metabarcoding was used to characterize both the prey contents of bat droppings and the insect community available as prey. To test for dietary differences among M. daubentonii individuals, we used ten microsatellite loci to assign droppings to individual bats. The comparison between consumed and available prey revealed a preference for certain prey items regardless of availability. Nonbiting midges (Chironomidae) remained the most highly consumed prey at all times, despite a signiﬁcant increase in the availability of black ﬂies (Simuliidae) towards the end of the season. The bats sampled showed no evidence of individual specialization in dietary preferences. Overall, our approach offers little support for optimal foraging theory. Thus, it shows how novel combinations of genetic markers can be used to test general theory, targeting patterns at both the level of prey communities and individual predators.",

We recently showed they harbour bacterial pathogen\n              Klebsiella pneumoniae\n              and closely related species in the\n              K\n              .\n              pneumoniae\n              species complex (\n              Kp\n              SC); however, the dynamics of\n              Kp\n              SC transmission and gene flow within flying fox colonies are poorly understood. High‐resolution genome comparisons of 39\n              Kp\n              SC isolates from grey‐headed flying foxes identified five putative strain transmission clusters (four intra‐ and one inter‐colony). The instance of inter‐colony strain transmission of\n              K\n              .\n              africana\n              was found between two flying fox populations within flying distance, indicating either direct or indirect transmission through a common food/water source. All 11 plasmids identified within the\n              Kp\n              SC isolates showed 73% coverage (mean) and ≥95% identity to human‐associated\n              Kp\n              SC plasmids, indicating gene flow between human clinical and grey‐headed flying fox isolates. Along with strain transmission, inter‐species horizontal plasmid transmission between\n              K\n              .\n              pneumoniae\n              and\n              Klebsiella africana\n              was also identified within a flying fox colony. Finally, genome‐scale metabolic models were generated to predict and compare substrate usage to previously published\n              Kp\n              SC models, from human and environmental sources. These models indicated no distinction on the basis of metabolic capabilities. Instead, metabolic capabilities were consistent with population structure and ST/lineage.",

Female Angolan free-tailed bats displayed a seasonal bimodally polyoestrous reproductive pattern. Parturition in December was followed closely by a postpartum oestrus. Ovarian follicle and endometrium cycles also closely followed the breeding season. The reproductive tract displayed complete dextral dominance with the right ovary and uterus being functionally dominant. Luteal activity was maintained throughout pregnancy and healthy corpora lutea were observed until late in pregnancy. Shedding of the zona pellucida occurred in the oviduct in the region of the ampulla±isthmus junction. The embryo entered the uterus as a morula, where it was transformed into a unilaminar, free-lying blastocyst. A unique feature of the pre-implantation uterus was the formation of a distinct decidua at the implantation site on the mesometrial side. Implantation in the Angolan free-tailed bat was centric and super®cial. First attachment of the trophoblast to the endometrium was mesometrial. The formation of a pre-placental pad of trophoblast cells was also initiated on the mesometrial side, while orientation of the embryonic disc was anti-mesometrial. Placental development occurred in the abembryonic hemisphere. Proliferation of the trophoblast over the embryonic hemisphere was slow and a bilaminar arrangement of the trophoblast was not observed in this region until after the primitive streak stage.",

Racemes persist, developing intermittently pedunculate capitula over a period of more than one year. The brush‐type, whitish flower heads are nocturnal in anthesis and active only a single night. Florets are relatively large and stout for the genus, hermaphroditic, with stiff filaments and style, and converge towards the periphery of the raceme. When expanding at dusk, the heads produce large nectar drops (up to 173 μl per head), that averages 25–29% sucrose. Production starts sequentially among florets of a capitulum. The drops are freely exposed, held between the filaments. The glossophagine bat\n              Lonchophylla mordax\n              was observed as the only legitimate visitor; hummingbirds exploited worn capitula at daytime, but did not pollinate. The bats lapped the nectar while hovering without apparently putting out their tongues. Pollen transmission was by the snout and probably by touching neighbouring flower heads with the wings. The blossoms, of a genus predominantly entomophilous, reveal habitual adaptation to bat pollination in most of their features. Small size (14 mm in diam.) and lack of a perceptible scent suggest that an evolutionary shift towards chiropterophily is still incomplete. A brief survey of the known distribution of bat pollination in Mimosaceae is appended.",

We monitored estrogen and 20-oxo-pregnane metabolites in fecal samples collected daily from 19 free-ranging female Saccopteryx bilineata during the assumed mating season. Median fecal estrogen metabolite levels equaled 0.09 ng/g for the pre- and postovulatory periods and 4.2 ng/g for the follicular phase of the estrous cycle in female S. bilineata. Median fecal 20-oxo-pregnane metabolite levels were 50.9 ng/g in preestrous, 88.8 ng/g in estrous, and 190.2 ng/g in postestrous females. Reliability of fecal steroid metabolite analysis was supported by results of video observations. Two successful copulations for a single male–female pair were recorded; mating coincided with peak fecal estrogen levels (7.0 ng/g) in the copulating female. In contrast, 2 observed mating attempts in a 2nd male–female pair occurred approximately 19 days after the female’s physiological estrus and fecal estrogen metabolites in the rejecting female were only 0.2 ng/g. Fecal 20oxo-pregnane levels were almost 3 times lower in fecal samples collected from the copulating female than those from the rejecting female (157 ng/g versus 410 ng/g). All females that were still present in the colony 6 months later gave birth to a single offspring between late May and early June. Gestation length averaged (mean 6 SE) 169 6 2 days. During the 20 days preceding parturition, fecal 20-oxo-pregnane metabolites were approximately 100 times higher than during the mating period. Fecal 20-oxo-pregnane metabolites of lactating females were comparable to those during the mating season. Noninvasive fecal steroid analysis can be a valuable tool for monitoring reproductive events in colonies of free-ranging small-sized bats.",

We used an isotopic approach to reveal the direction of seed transfer mediated by three co-existing short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia castanea, C. sowelli and C. perspicillata) between a forest and an adjacent mid-successional site (>15 y since deforestation); two habitats where individuals of the genus Piper differed in stable carbon isotope ratios by ∼2.5‰. In a feeding experiment, we conﬁrmed that δ13C of seeds is not altered by digestive processes. We then collected seeds defecated by bats of the genus Carollia and found that δ13C of these seeds is higher than those of Piper individuals growing in the forest, irrespective of whether bats were captured in or outside the forest. We conclude that bats of the genus Carollia were more likely to carry seeds from successional areas into the forest than in the opposite direction.",

Using a stable isotope approach, we tested in colonies of vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) whether food sharing occurs among few or many females; vampires are known to regurgitate recently ingested blood for starving conspeciﬁcs. Accordingly, the isotopic signatures of vampires depend not only on individual prey choice but also on the extent of food sharing among isotopically contrasting conspeciﬁcs. By measuring the stable carbon isotope ratio in tissues with varying isotopic retention in individual vampires (blood: approx. 2 wk; wing membrane tissue: approx. 2 mo; fur: >6 mo), we estimated the variation in the percentages of carbon derived from pasture (via blood from cattle and horses). We expected to ﬁnd narrow ranges of percentages in individual vampires, because we anticipated food sharing only within small female networks if food sharing happened at all. Overall, vampire bats obtained 79.2 Æ 12.3% of carbon from grazers. The range of percentages was small within the majority of individuals in relation to that across all individuals, suggesting that most vampires were isotopic specialists. We expected females to be more isotopically generalistic than males, as food sharing was observed to occur more often between females than between males. Indeed, stable isotope evidence suggested that more females obtained carbon from isotopically contrasting sources than males. This pattern is consistent with food sharing in small groups of female vampires, provided that food sharing occurred at all.",

It has been difficult to ascertain how closely biological reality matches model predictions, largely because of the technical challenges of accurately measuring the power expended when an animal flies. We designed a study to measure flight speed-dependent aerodynamic power directly from the kinetic energy contained in the wake of bats flying in a wind tunnel. We compared these measurements with two theoretical predictions that have been used for several decades in diverse fields of vertebrate biology and to metabolic measurements from a previous study using the same individuals. A high-accuracy displaced laser sheet stereo particle image velocimetry experimental design measured the wake velocities in the Trefftz plane behind four bats flying over a range of speeds (3–7 m s\n              −1\n              ). We computed the aerodynamic power contained in the wake using a novel interpolation method and compared these results with the power predicted by Pennycuick's and Rayner's models. The measured aerodynamic power falls between the two theoretical predictions, demonstrating that the models effectively predict the appropriate range of flight power, but the models do not accurately predict minimum power or maximum range speeds. Mechanical efficiency—the ratio of aerodynamic power output to metabolic power input—varied from 5.9% to 9.8% for the same individuals, changing with flight speed.",

We present the results of the first study to assess whether litters of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) containing dizygotic twins share the same father. We sampled 26 mother–offspring triads from three colonies in Indiana and Illinois, as well as 299 additional adults (237 females and 62 males) from these colonies and six other maternity colonies in the same area in 1997–1998. All individuals were genotyped at nine highly variable autosomal microsatellite loci and one X-linked locus. We assessed multiple paternity using autosomal and X-linked locus exclusions, and using maximum-likelihood methods. All methods confirmed multiple paternity within litters, and the maximum-likelihood analyses indicated that almost half of the sampled litters were composed of maternal half-siblings rather than full-siblings. Our results highlight the potential importance of post-copulatory mechanisms of paternity determination in the mating system of big brown bats, and have important implications for gene flow and population structuring in this species.",

The additional time associated with finding or assessing the availability of a new roost, moving offspring to the new roost, coordinating with other group members, and meeting any increased energetic demands that may be associated with these behaviors may influence the number and duration of feeding bouts of reproductive females. To examine the influence of roost-switching on nocturnal activity patterns we radio-tagged lactating female silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and monitored them on nights when they moved to a new roost site and nights when no roost shift occurred. The typical activity pattern on a non-move night consisted of an initial long bout away from the day roost (median length: 177.4 min) followed by alternating bouts in (50.6 min) and away (57.0 min) from the roost for the rest of the night. On move nights bats reduced the length of their first absent period (82.7 min) and increased the number of trips from the roost, although neither the length of these subsequent absent periods nor the total time absent from the roosts differed from non-move nights. Similarly, total time spent in roosts did not differ between move and non-move nights, but bats made more and shorter visits on move nights. Visits to original and new roosts were not synchronous among colony members, and the length of time for individuals from the same colony to move to a new roost varied from 1 to 4 h. Our results indicate that roost switching did not influence the total time spent in or away from day roosts. Rather, bats moved between the original roost, the new roost, and foraging areas with much greater frequency on move nights.",

Long-tailed bats arrived in New Zealand an estimated two million years ago and are closely related to other Australian bat species. Lesser short-tailed bats, in contrast, are the only extant species within the Mystacinidae and are estimated to have been living in isolation in New Zealand for the past 16–18 million years. Throughout this period of isolation, lesser short-tailed bats have become one of the most terrestrial bats in the world. Through a metatranscriptomic analysis of guano samples from eight locations across New Zealand, we aimed to characterise the viromes of New Zealand’s bats and determine whether viruses have jumped between these species over the past two million years. High viral richness was observed among long-tailed bats with viruses spanning seven different viral families. In contrast, no bat-specific viruses were identified in lesser short-tailed bats. Both bat species harboured an abundance of likely dietary- and environment-associated viruses. We also identified alphacoronaviruses in long-tailed bat guano that had previously been identified in lesser short-tailed bats, suggesting that these viruses had jumped the species barrier after long-tailed bats migrated to New Zealand. Of note, an alphacoronavirus species discovered here possessed a complete genome of only 22,416 nucleotides with entire deletions or truncations of several non-structural proteins, thereby representing what may be the shortest genome within the Coronaviridae identified to date. Overall, this study has revealed a diverse range of novel viruses harboured by New Zealand’s only native terrestrial mammals, in turn expanding our understanding of bat viral dynamics and evolution globally.",

Bats are the only native land dwelling mammals on this archipelago, but the biogeographical origins for the vast majority of species within this group are ambiguous. We report here genetic analyses based on two mitochondrial DNA markers to infer the origin of Comorian bats belonging to a reputed species complex of Miniopterus that is further distributed across Africa and Madagascar. Phylogenetic reconstructions show that east African M. minor are not closely related to the insular Miniopterus of Madagascar and the Comoros (Grande Comore and Anjouan). The latter cluster into two distinct, monophyletic clades (Clade 1 and Clade 2). Representatives of these clades occur sympatrically both on the Comoros and on Madagascar, and are distinguished by a large genetic distance (K2P: 9.9% for cytochrome b). No haplotypes are shared between any islands, suggesting the absence of contemporary gene flow. Populations of the widespread Clade 1 are furthermore characterized by a significant inter-island structure (FCT = 0.249), and by high haplotype and nucleotide diversities (h = 0.90–0.98, p = 0.04–0.06). Demographic analyses of Clade 1 suggest secondary contact between two distinct phylogroups (Subclade 1 A and 1B) that reached Grande Comore and Anjouan, and a large, stable population with a long evolutionary history on Madagascar. These results and the current distribution of related lineages suggest that the Comoros were colonized independently at least two or three times by ancestors from Madagascar.",

The genome is a circular molecule of 16,463 bp length, containing 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and a control region. Most of the genes were encoded on the H-strand, except for 8 tRNA and ND6 genes. Phylogenetic trees of the complete mitochondrial genome were constructed using RAxML. Our result suggests that M. cyclotis is closely related to M. leucogaster from Korea. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of M. cyclotis will be helpful for future taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on Murina.",

It is easily distinguished from other Glossophaginae because of its tricolored dorsal pelage with a dark basal band, well-furred elbow, lack of lower incisors, and wing membrane attached to the foot at about mid-length of the metatarsals. L. obscura is a foliage-roosting species, and primarily feeds on nectar and pollen. The species is rare because locally it occurs in low numbers. Despite the lack of information and low abundance, L. obscura is listed as a species of “Least Concern” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.",

There are two currently recognized species within the P. personatus complex, for which we examined 235 cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences and 138 cytochrome b (Cytb) sequences in order to explore its genetic variation in Mexico as well as in Central and South America. Our results reveal considerable differences in the genetic structure inside this species complex, indicating five genetic lineages: 1) Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican Pacific coastal plain to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, 2) Southeastern Mexico, 3) Guatemala, 4) Guyana and Suriname-COI/Guyana and Venezuela-Cytb, and 5) Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and Brazil. In addition, we used the isolation-with-migration coalescent method to estimate divergence times. The results indicate that vicariant events occurred roughly 1,624,000–2,450,000 years ago during the Early Pleistocene, wherein Central America was the center of two separate diversification processes, one toward Mexico and the other South America. The intraspecific lineages obtained for P. personatus demonstrate the need to reevaluate the species complex limits of this taxon.",

The wingspan, wing loading and aspect ratio of the two species were relatively low, and those of T. pachypus were lower compared with T. robustula. The echolocation calls of T. pachypus and T. robustula consist of a broadband frequency modulated (FM) sweep followed by a short narrowband FM sweep. The dominant frequency of calls of T. pachypus was 65.1 kHz, whereas that of T. robustula was 57.7 kHz. The call frequencies (including highest frequency of the call, lowest frequency of the call and frequency of the call that contained most energy) of T. pachypus were higher than those of T. robustula, and the pulse duration of the former was longer than that of the latter. The inter-pulse interval and bandwidth of the calls were not signiﬁcantly different between the two species. Tylonycteris pachypus foraged in more complex environments than T. robustula, although the two species were both netted in edge habitats (around trees or houses), along pathways and in the tops of trees. Tylonycteris pachypus ﬂew slower (straight level ﬂight speed, 4.3 m sÀ1) than T. robustula (straight level ﬂight speed, 4.8 m sÀ1). We discuss the relationship between wing morphology, echolocation calls, foraging behaviour and ﬂight speed, and demonstrate resource partitioning between these two species in terms of morphological and behavioural factors.",

            "abstractNote": "Rhinolophids (horseshoe bats) are a widespread and diverse family. Their high level of morphological convergence has made taxonomic identification and estimation of species diversity problematic. The Rhinolophus philippinensis group, which is characterized with huge ears and low echolocation frequency relative to body size, is a specific group among all the rhinolophid groups, but the phylogeny of this group is poorly understood. In this study, we performed integrated analyses of the morphology, acoustic and genetic data and constructed the first multilocus phylogeny for the philippinensis group using four mitochondrial genes, four autosomal introns and one Y‐linked intron in 95 specimens representing nine taxa. Phylogenies were constructed based on concatenated phylogenetic methods and a multilocus coalescence approach. The estimated phylogenies revealed the polyphyly of the philippinensis group. Except for R. philippinensis, all the other species in this group formed a monophyletic cluster, named herewith as “R. macrotis” species group. Phylogenies, genetic and phenotypic divergence, and species delimitation analyses supported the revised status of R. paradoxolophus as a subspecies of R. rex, R. cf. macrotis as a subspecies of R. macrotis, and R. huananus and R. cf. siamensis as junior synonyms of R. siamensis. Significant discordances were found between the mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting or ancient introgression events within the philippinensis group. The macrotis group appeared to have undergone a rapid radiation approximately 2.57 million years ago during the early Pleistocene period due to palaeoclimatic oscillations. Reconstruction of the ancestral ranges suggested a wide distribution of the common ancestor for the philippinensis and macrotis groups.",

The morphology, echolocation call structure, diet, and foraging areas of S. kuhlii were studied on Hainan Island, south China from March to November 2006. Data from 85 individuals indicate that S. kuhlii is a medium-sized bat with 50.41 ± 1.36 (0 ± SE) mm forearm length and 19.81 ± 3.47 g body mass. The wing morphology with high wing-loading (11.38 ± 1.95 N/m2) and moderate aspect ratio (6.96 ± 0.75) indicates that S. kuhlii flies fast and forages in open habitat and at the edges of cluttered environments. Echolocation calls of S. kuhlii consist of a fundamental and up to four harmonics, with a dominant frequency of 45.72 ± 2.09 kHz, and call shape suggests that this species is adapted to forage in open environments. Data from mist-netting and acoustic detection indicated that S. kuhlii foraged mainly around the crown of trees and street lights. Nine insect orders were recorded in its diet, with Lepidoptera (97.46%, by frequency) and Coleoptera (64.72 ± 2.37%, by volume) constituting the main prey, together with Hemiptera (19.99 ± 1.25%) and Hymenoptera (9.43 ± 1.14%). There was significant seasonal variation in the diet of S. kuhlii: Coleoptera increased from March to May, and then decreased to August, while Hemiptera and Hymenoptera showed the inverse trend.",

To investigate the DNA faecal prevalence of the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum, we sampled 23 lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) maternity colonies located in buildings (churches, barns) in rural villages of eastern France. A total of 552 faecal samples were collected from 278 individuals. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was detected in the faeces of 63 individuals (22.7%). Such high prevalence might suggest persistent infection in bats and/or a frequent consumption of insect preys carrying bacteria. Faecal DNA prevalence varied highly among colonies but was not related to the colony size. Faecal DNA prevalence was the highest in the Jura Department, where the density of ticks is known to be the highest across the study area. Because the sampled bats live in close proximity to humans, we discuss how concerning the presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA in bat guano is for humans frequenting places of worship that shelter bats. We also advocate future research to understand what a high faecal DNA prevalence in bat guano really implicates in terms of bacteria transmission.",

Animals studied A total of 36 bats belonging to three different species (Desmodus rotundus, Diameus youngi, and Artibeus lituratus) were used to perform this investigation. Thirteen Diameus youngi and six Desmodus rotundus were trapped in a cave, and 17 captive Artibeus lituratus were obtained from an experimental colony. Both free-ranging and captive bats were free of apparent ocular or systemic disease. Procedures Corneal and conjunctival swabs were collected from both eyes to identify the resident bacterial microbiota.\nResults Seventeen bats had positive bacterial cultures in one or both eyes. Considering all isolates, Gram-positive bacteria (82.6%) predominated over those that were Gramnegative bacteria (17.4%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (30.4%) were the most isolated genus, followed by Bacillus spp. (26%) and Corynebacterium spp. (21%). Only four Gram-negative species were isolated: Shigella spp., Hafnia alvei, Morganella morganii, and Flavobacterium odoratum.\nConclusions In this study, bacterial microbiota of the ocular surface of bats was described, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated type of microorganism from healthy bat eyes.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Hibernation, a survival strategy in mammals for extreme climates, induces physiological phenomena such as ischemia–reperfusion and metabolic shifts that hold great potential for advancements in modern medicine. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms underpinning hibernation remain largely unclear. This study used RNA‐seq and Iso‐seq techniques to investigate the changes in liver transcriptome expression of\n              Rhinolophus pusillus\n              during hibernation and active periods, as well as under different microhabitat temperatures. We identified 11 457 differentially expressed genes during hibernation and active periods, of which 395 showed significant differential expression. Genes associated with fatty acid catabolism were significantly upregulated during hibernation, whereas genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and glycogen synthesis were downregulated. Conversely, immune‐related genes displayed differential expression patterns: genes tied to innate immunity were significantly upregulated, while those linked to adaptive immunity and inflammatory response were downregulated. The analysis of transcriptomic data obtained from different microhabitat temperatures revealed that\n              R. pusillus\n              exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism in lower microhabitat temperature. This upregulation facilitated an enhanced utilization rate of triglyceride, ultimately resulting in increased energy provision for the organism. Additionally,\n              R. pusillus\n              upregulated gluconeogenesis‐related genes regardless of the microhabitat temperature, demonstrating the importance of maintaining blood glucose levels during hibernation. Our transcriptomic data reveal that these changes in liver gene expression optimize energy allocation during hibernation, suggesting that liver tissue adaptively responds to the inherent stress of its function during hibernation. This study sheds light on the role of differential gene expression in promoting more efficient energy allocation during hibernation. It contributes to our understanding of how liver tissue adapts to the stressors associated with this state.",

Artiﬁcial selection for increased resistance to the acute toxic effects of cadmium was performed, and after eight generations, the average median effective concentration increased from 61 to 180 ␮g/L. No differences in life span, offspring production, time to ﬁrst brood, number of offspring in the ﬁrst brood, or intrinsic rate of population increase (r) were observed between the cadmiumadapted population and the controls under ideal conditions or under conditions of temperature or feeding ration stress, but cadmiumadapted daphnids were smaller. Control and cadmium-adapted populations were equally sensitive to copper and malathion, but the cadmium-adapted population was less sensitive to lead and more sensitive to phenol. Analysis of ampliﬁed fragment-length polymorphisms indicated a signiﬁcant decrease in genetic diversity in the cadmium-adapted population. Although the evolved cadmium resistance would allow adapted populations to exist in areas where cadmium concentrations would be toxic to unadapted populations, the decreased genetic diversity, smaller size, and increased sensitivity to at least one other toxicant could reduce the probability of long-term survival even in the absence of future cadmium exposure.",

            "abstractNote": "In their natural environment, big brown bats forage for small insects in open spaces, as well as in vegetation and in the presence of acoustic clutter. While searching and hunting for prey, bats experience sonar interference, not only from densely cluttered environments, but also from calls of conspecifics foraging in close proximity. Previous work has shown that when two bats compete for a single prey item in a relatively open environment, one of the bats may go silent for extended periods of time, which can serve to minimize sonar interference between conspecifics. Additionally, pairs of big brown bats have been shown to adjust frequency characteristics of their vocalizations to avoid acoustic interference in echo processing. In this study, we extended previous work by examining how the presence of conspecifics <i>and</i> environmental clutter influence the bat's echolocation behavior. By recording multichannel audio and video data of bats engaged in insect capture in open and cluttered spaces, we quantified the bats' vocal and flight behaviors. Big brown bats flew individually and in pairs in an open and cluttered room, and the results of this study shed light on the different strategies that this species employs to negotiate a complex and dynamic environment.",

Violations of the\n                    P\n                    oisson assumption were strong and accounting for them qualitatively changed results, presumably because larger counts had undue influence when overdispersion had not been accounted for. We advise that future\n                    CATS\n                    analysts routinely check for overdispersion and account for it if present.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are particularly susceptible to environmental changes because of their low reproductive rate, longevity, and high metabolic rates, which lead to relatively high food requirements. Thus, bat populations take a relatively long time to recover from increased mortality rates, and monitoring schemes should cover long time periods. In this work, we analyzed the population trajectories of two bat species, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Myotis myotis, the most numerous in five caves in southern Poland, which are known as important bat hibernacula on a continental scale. Data were collected by regular counts in 1985–2020, depending on the particular cave; in addition, previous data on the number of hibernating bats in these caves, available since 1951, were taken from existing publications. We analyzed time-series data using average locality indices and TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data) methods, and both produced similar results. Generally, the populations of the two studied bat species showed recent increasing trends, especially visible as an effect of recovery after years of decline. The situation recorded in southern Poland is very similar to that described in other places in Europe, where recoveries of bat populations have also been observed in the last decades. Although it is difficult to present results from formal analyses, because of the lack of good data, at least some factors—less exposure to contaminants (pesticides, heavy metals), improving food availability due to climate change, and a lower predation rate (including human pressure), both in the breeding season and during wintering—positively affected both species.",

            "abstractNote": "In polygynous mating systems, few males have stable access to sexual mates. With an expected higher copulation rate, harem males may deplete seminal fluids or increase epididymal sperm maturation, generating poor sperm quality. In a first study, we reported a higher sperm quality in sneaker males of Carollia perspicillata. To test whether the lower sperm quality observed in harem males was generated by an elevated copulation rate, we temporarily removed males of both social statuses from the colony. We thus assessed status-related changes of sperm quality resulting from sexual abstinence. Moreover, released from territory and female guarding, harem males were expected to show a reduction in somatic costs. On the basis of sperm competition models, we predicted a higher resource investment in the ejaculate with the reduction of pre-copulatory efforts. In line with our predictions, sperm quality of harem males improved significantly in contrast to sneaker males, whose sperm quality did not change. Without an increase in ejaculate lipid peroxidation, our results also provide evidence that the duration of sexual abstinence was not sufficient to generate sperm oxidative damage through senescence. Harem males did not show a reduction in blood lipid peroxidation or in the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione. In line with the maintenance of these somatic costs, harem males did not invest more superoxide dismutase to the ejaculate to maintain sperm quality. Our results suggest that a difference in copulation rate rather than an adaptation to sperm competition provides sneaker males with higher sperm quality in C. perspicillata.",

We examined the distributions of Myotis lucifugus (little brown myotis), Myotis septentrionalis (northern long-eared myotis), and Perimyotis subflavus (tri-colored bat) in eastern Nebraska by setting acoustic detectors for a single night at 105 sites in wooded habitats during summers of 2012 and 2014. We compared 2 methods of determining presence at each site. Results of our analyses are fine-scale distributional maps for these bats and some range extensions from published records. Results for M. septentrionalis and P. subflavus are largely consistent with previous reports. Results for M. lucifugus vary depending on the method of determining presence; however, our preferred method creates a pattern consistent with the known vouchered distribution of this species. The differences between published distributions of these species and distributions based on acoustic detection from our study might result from a lack of extensive netting in many areas of eastern Nebraska, underrepresentation of P. subflavus from mist net surveys in Nebraska, and a recent westward range expansion of P. subflavus and M. septentrionalis in southern Nebraska.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) has claimed the lives of millions of hibernating insectivorous bats in North America. Its etiologic agent, the psychrophilic fungus Geomyces destructans, causes skin lesions that are the hallmark of the disease. The fungal infection is characterized by a white powdery growth on muzzle, ears and wing membranes. While WNS may threaten some species of North American bats with regional extinction, infection in hibernating bats in Europe seems not to be associated with significant mortality. We performed histopathological investigations on biopsy samples of 11 hibernating European bats, originating from 4 different countries, colonized by G. destructans. One additional bat was euthanized to allow thorough examination of multiple strips of its wing membranes. Molecular analyses of touch imprints, swabs and skin samples confirmed that fungal structures were G. destructans. Additionally, archived field notes on hibernacula monitoring data in the Harz Mountains, Germany, over an 11-year period (2000-2011) revealed multiple capture-recapture events of 8 banded bats repeatedly displaying characteristic fungal colonization. Skin lesions of G. destructans-affected hibernating European bats are intriguingly similar to the epidermal lesions described in North American bats. Nevertheless, deep invasion of fungal hyphae into the dermal connective tissue with resulting ulceration like in North American bats was not observed in the biopsy samples of European bats; all lesions found were restricted to the layers of the epidermis and its adnexae. Two bats had mild epidermal cupping erosions as described for North American bats. The possible mechanisms for any difference in outcomes of G. destructans infection in European and North American bats still need to be elucidated.",

Our investigation into intersexual feeding habits of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) revealed different feeding strategies between males and females. Contrary to our predictions, there was no significant difference in time of emergence between males and females, and males and females foraged for equal lengths of time. Temperature influenced length of foraging bouts of both sexes. Female bats exhibited site fidelity within the river valley close to the colonies. Males foraged over larger areas than did females, and spent significantly more time away from the main feeding area than did females. We conclude that the areas in which males foraged were of lower quality or required longer commuting distances, thus requiring males to forage for as long as females.",

Using radio telemetry, we obtained empirical evidence of roosting activity for Little Brown Myotis on the north coast of British Columbia. One non-reproductive adult female and 2 adult male Little Brown Myotis were found to use 4 unique roosting locations in the Prince Rupert area. Three of 4 confirmed roost sites were located in anthropogenic structures, including an industrial warehouse and two 2-story houses. The 4th roost was located in a cedar hedge on a residential property. Roosts were located within 890 to 1140 m of capture sites, which were sited in suitable bat foraging habitat. One male bat re-used the same daytime roost for the duration of the study period, whereas a 2nd male selected 2 different roost locations during the study. Despite the potential limitation of the small sample size of this telemetry study, our findings contribute to the understanding of roosts used by Little Brown Myotis on the north coast of British Columbia, and provide a basis for future directed studies and conservation efforts.",
