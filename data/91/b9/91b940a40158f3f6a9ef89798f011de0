            "abstractNote": "Echolocating bats have developed advanced auditory perception systems, predominantly using acoustic signaling to communicate with each other. They can emit a diverse range of social calls in complex behavioral contexts. This study examined the vocal repertoire of ﬁve pregnant big-footed myotis bats (Myotis macrodactylus). In the process of clustering, the last individual to return to the colony (LI) emitted social calls that correlated with behavior, as recorded on a PC-based digital recorder. These last individuals could emit 10 simple monosyllabic and 27 complex multisyllabic types of calls, constituting four types of syllables. The social calls were composed of highly stereotyped syllables, hierarchically organized by a common set of syllables. However, intra-speciﬁc variation was also found in the number of syllables, syllable order and patterns of syllable repetition across call renditions. Data were obtained to characterize the signiﬁcant individual differences that existed in the maximum frequency and duration of calls. Time taken to return to the roost was negatively associated with the diversity of social calls. Our ﬁndings indicate that variability in social calls may be an effective strategy taken by individuals during reintegration into clusters of female M. macrodactylus.",

            "abstractNote": "Human–­bat interactions are now the source of the majority of locally acquired human lyssavirus infections in many high-­income countries without hematophagous or ‘vampire’ bat species. This study aims to identify the most common types and circumstances of bat exposures occurring among members of the general public in high-­ income countries with no hematophagous bats, and to describe the health-­seeking behaviours associated with exposures in these settings. We conducted a scoping review of relevant academic and grey literature on bat exposures and confirmed bat lyssavirus infections among members of the general public in Australia, Canada, the United States and high-­income European countries from 1996 to 2019. Case studies and population-­based studies were included for analysis, and findings were extracted and synthesized by the literature type and geographic region. A total of 63 publications were identified, including: 47 case studies and 16 population-b­ased studies. Overall, most exposures in Australia and Europe were intentionally initiated by humans and involved attempts to handle, touch or help a bat. In North America, however, household exposures were more common and predominantly involved a bat being found in a room or area where a person had slept. Studies also showed that a proportion of bat exposures in high-­income countries go unreported in the absence of a public health investigation and are therefore unlikely to receive prompt treatment. The results of this review suggest that the most effective strategies for preventing bat exposures vary between regions and that health-­seeking behaviours following bat exposures could be improved in high-­income settings.",

            "abstractNote": "Despite ongoing public health messages about the risks associated with bat contact, the number of potential exposures to Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) due to intentional handling by members of the general public in Queensland has remained high. We sought to better understand the reasons for intentional handling among these members of the public who reported their potential exposure to inform future public health messages. We interviewed adults who resided in a defined geographic area in South East Queensland and notified potential exposure to ABLV due to intentional handling of bats by telephone between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013. The participation rate was 54%. Adults who reported they had intentionally handled bats in South East Queensland indicated high levels of knowledge and perception of a moderately high risk associated with bats with overall low intentions to handle bats in the future. However, substantial proportions of people would attempt to handle bats again in some circumstances, particularly to protect their children or pets. Fifty-­two percent indicated that they would handle a bat if a child was about to pick up or touch a live bat, and 49% would intervene if a pet was interacting with a bat. Future public health communications should recognize the situations in which even people with high­risk perceptions of bats will attempt to handle them. Public health messages currently focus on avoidance of bats in all circumstances and recommend calling in a trained vaccinated handler, but messaging directed at adults for circumstances where children or pets may be potentially exposed should provide safe immediate management options.",

Data on testis anatomy and activity were obtained from 20 males. Males had migratory testes as they are displaced in the inguinal canals between intra and external abdominal positions. The displacement mechanism consisted of a testis ligament composed mainly of smooth muscle tissue attached to the cranial pole of the testis. Since the epididymis is closely tied to the testis, both organs are displaced together, regardless of the individual reproductive condition. Males and females showed seasonal monoestry, with a short mating period at the beginning of the dry season. The occurrence of breeding males was inversely proportional to rain and air temperature. At the mid-dry season, when air tem­ peratures are also lower, males showed testis regressing, remaining in a reproductive hiatus for several months (rest/recrudescence) until the beginning of in the next dry season. Pregnant females were captured at the end of the dry season, and the birth of the young occurred during the rainy season, a time of greater food availability. Thus, females coordinated their reproductive phases to a more favorable period of the year for their survival and that of the offspring. Males associated their spermatogenic activity to a time of no environmental nor physio­ logical restriction related to low air temperature.",

Based on measurement data of wing size and motions of Eptesicus fuscus, we present a new computational bat wing model with divided fragments of skeletons and membrane. The motions of the model were verified by comparing the joint and tip trajectories with native bats. The influences of flap, sweep, elbow, wrist and digits motions, the effects of different bones and membrane of bat wing, the components on vertical, spanwise and fore-aft directions of the inertial power and force were analyzed. Our results indicate that the flap, sweep, and elbow motions contribute the main inertial power and force; the membrane occupies an important proportion of the inertial power and force; inertial power on flap direction was larger, while variations of inertial forces on different directions were not evident. These methods and results offer insights into flight dynamics in other flying animals and may contribute to the design of future robotic bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are important pollinators, but they are difficult to study since they are volant and nocturnal. Thus, long-term studies of nectarivorous bats are scarce, despite their potential to help assess trends in bat populations and their pollination services. We used capture rates of nectarivorous bats at chiropterophilous flowers in order to examine temporal trends in bat visitation in an area that is undergoing extensive land use change. We mist-netted at five bat-pollinated plant taxa (Durio zibethinus, Musa acuminata, Oroxylum indicum, Parkia speciosa, and Sonneratia spp.) in southern Thailand over six years between 2011 and 2021. We found that the most common bat species, Eonycteris spelaea, was the main visitor at all five plant taxa and had consistent visitation rates across all study years. In contrast, two other important pollinators, Macroglossus minimus and M. sobrinus, showed 80% declines in the number of individuals netted at mangrove apple (Sonneratia spp.) and banana (Musa acuminata) flowers, respectively. These findings suggest that E. spelaea (a large, cave-roosting species with a broad diet) is more tolerant of anthropogenic change than are Macroglossus bats (small, foliage-roosting species with specialized diets), which may in turn affect the reproductive success of plants pollinated by these species. Our study demonstrates how decade-long monitoring can reveal species-specific temporal patterns in pollinator visitation, emphasizing the need for tailored conservation plans. While the conservation status of most nectarivorous bats in the area is Least Concern, our results indicate that population studies in Southeast Asia are urgently needed for updated bat species conservation assessments.",

We present evidence, based on one specimen collected in 2005, confirming the presence of this species in the Caribbean of Honduras within the Islas de la Bahía department. This discovery increases the count of known species within this family to 18 in the country and raises the total bat species count for Honduras to 114. We recommend a detailed study of historical specimens to confirm the identification of species that may have been misidentified as well as a thorough examination of molossids distributed in northern Honduras.",

            "abstractNote": "Knowledge about the biodiversity of Baja California has been obtained mainly from natural protected areas (NPAs), while some unprotected natural areas have been poorly studied. The Sierra Cucapá in the northeast of the peninsula is one example. The objectives of this study are 1) to integrate existing knowledge of bird, mammal, and reptile diversity in Cucapá from public databases, citizen science platforms, and information generated from fieldwork, 2) to identify the spatial distribution of records in the study area, 3) to compare the composition of vertebrate species of Cucapá with that of NPAs of northern part of the peninsula, and 4) to assess the biological conservation value of Cucapá. We obtained records of 150 species of native vertebrates (102 birds, 34 mammals, and 14 reptiles) of which 10 species of birds, four mammals, and seven reptiles are included in a risk extinction category. The different sources of information contributed in a complementary way to the species inventories. Large areas in western and northern Cucapá lack records. The total difference in species composition between Cucapá and nearby NPAs ranged between 58 and 69% for birds, 61 and 79% for mammals, and 69 and 87% for reptiles. The species richness of Cucapá, its particular species composition, the presence of species in risk extinction categories, and the number and size of unexplored areas indicate that this area represents an opportunity for biological conservation in the northern part of the Peninsula. This work provides compelling data for the protection of Cucapá.",

The southern bent-winged bat (Miniopterus orianae bassanii), a critically endangered cave-dwelling taxon in Australia, has been described as undertaking regional-scale migration between maternity and non-breeding caves. Aims. To describe the seasonal cycle of movements by the southern bent-winged bat, including migration and congregation events of different sexand age-classes in the population. Methods. We tagged a total of 2966 southern bent-winged bats with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. Antennas were used to detect bats in flight at a major maternity cave and a key non-breeding cave in south-east South Australia, from January 2016 to August 2019. We used capture–resight histories to visualise population patterns and model the daily encounter probability for each sex- and age-class at the respective roost sites. Key results. Bats congregated at the maternity cave for most of the year, with different seasonal patterns among sex- and age-classes. Seasonal movements were associated with behaviour over winter months: most of the population dispersed from the maternity cave from May and a staged return occurred among population classes from July through September. A previously unde­ scribed movement occurred in adult females and juveniles each year: these classes left the maternity cave in late summer, when juveniles became independent, and returned in early mid-autumn, later undertaking winter dispersal. Complex underlying movements of individuals occurred throughout the year, with individuals able to fly 72 km between roosting caves in just a few hours. Conclusions. Seasonal movements are a key aspect of the life history of this taxon. The newly reported movement of adult females and juveniles conforms to the maternal guidance hypothesis, whereby mothers guide their young to suitable non-breeding caves and hibernation sites. In addition to seasonal movements, some individuals moved 72 km between caves multiple times over short time periods, including on successive nights. This 72-km overnight flight distance more than doubles the previous distance used to inform management buffer zones. Extended congregation of bats at the maternity cave highlights resource limitation in the surrounding area as a potential threat to this population. Implications. The dynamic nature of the population has implications for the management of emerging risks, including mortality at windfarms and potential rapid spread of the exotic white-nose syndrome.",

Current best management practices in New England have limited disturbances in forested wetlands due to concerns for wetland function and water quality. As a result, forested wetlands often have large, mature trees that were formerly rare under natural disturbance regimes. Our goal was to determine whether experimentally felling trees within forested wetlands is an effective management action to improve foraging habitat for insectivorous bats. In the winter of 2019 while the ground was frozen, we felled all trees in an area of approximately 0.1 ha in each of 3 forested wetlands to simulate a natural disturbance, similar to that caused by beaver activity or windthrow. The following spring and summer of 2019 and 2020, we monitored bat activity in the 3 treated forested wetlands as well as 3 untreated forested wetlands. We found that for all species recorded, bat activity was higher in treated wetlands than in untreated wetlands. We also found\n              Lasiurus borealis\n              and\n              Lasionycteris noctivagans\n              had a delayed response to treatments, with higher activity in the second year after treatments. Our findings suggest that managing forested wetlands consistent with historic patterns of forest disturbance and regeneration is beneficial to insectivorous bats. The positive response by bats to tree felling indicates that promoting age‐class and structural diversity in forest canopies without flooding or soil disturbance is an appropriate consideration with respect to best management practices in forested wetlands.",

While anthropogenic effects on wildlife and their habitats are typically viewed as negative, highway infrastructure might benefit numerous species of plants and animals, bats in particular. Cracks, crevices, and grooves within structures provide places for bats to roost. Here we review the literature on this topic as well as describe results of our own survey of bridges and culverts in the Trans-Pecos of Texas. We surveyed 204 bridges and 768 culverts between 2018 and 2019. We observed 7 species of bats using bridges or culverts as day roosts. Frequency of use of highway structures for bats varied depending on characteristics of structures. Prestressed concrete box girder bridges were the bridge type most used by bats (90.91% occupied), while steel I-beam bridges were the least used (0%). Box and pipe culverts were used in equal proportions (16.5% of box culverts and 13.7% of pipes were occupied), likely because different kinds of culverts present similar types of places for bats to roost. These findings contribute to other surveys around the country and can inform management plans for departments of transportation and wildlife managers.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat species diversity within the United States is greatest in the Southwest, with approximately 30 species present. At least 16 of these bat species hibernate and are susceptible to white-nose syndrome (WNS), which is caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Since 2006, millions of bats from 35 U.S. states and 7 Canadian provinces have died from WNS. In previous studies of external surfaces of bats sampled from southwestern states, Actinobacteria were detected that were shown to have antifungal properties against P. destructans in laboratory testing. These studies motivated us to expand our research to sites that represent possible gateways for P. destructans to enter the Southwest so that we could establish a baseline of bat microbiota before the arrival of WNS. We surveyed for the presence of bats and their external microbiota at 3 national parks and monuments located in southeastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico. Our results document new occurrence records of bat species and their external bacteria at each sampling location. Additionally, we provide insight on the composition of bat external microbiota in the absence of P. destructans, while revealing information about the Streptomyces and other possible native defenses of bats against P. destructans at a gateway into the Southwest.",

            "abstractNote": "Little information exists on the habitat use and feeding ecology of insectivorous bats in arid ecosystems, especially at and near uranium mines in northern Arizona, within the Grand Canyon watershed. In 2015–2016, we conducted mist-netting, nightly acoustic monitoring (>1 year), and diet analyses of bats, as well as insect sampling, at 2 uranium mines (Pinenut and Arizona 1) with water containment ponds. Because of physical barriers and limited general access to areas within the mine yard, mist-netting was limited to outside of the perimeter fence and away from the containment ponds. Mist-netting also occurred at 2 nearby sites that served as proxies to the mines. Bats captured directly at the mines included one pregnant Antrozous pallidus and 3 adult male Parastrellus hesperus. At the proxy sites, we captured 45 individuals identified as A. pallidus, Corynorhinus townsendii, Eptesicus fuscus, Euderma maculatum, Lasionycteris noctivagans, Myotis californicus, Myotis ciliolabrum, P. hesperus, and Tadarida brasiliensis. The nightly and seasonal presence of bats, as shown through acoustic recordings at each mine, coincided with the seasonal migratory and hibernation behaviors of the bat species. Statistical comparisons of acoustic recordings with precipitation data collected over one year show that seasonal monsoon rains generally had a negative effect on the nightly activity and presence of bats. Diets of P. hesperus from both mines were comprised mostly of coleopterans but also included smaller volumes of Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, and Neuroptera. The diet of A. pallidus was comprised solely of Coleoptera. Diets of bat species from the proxy sites were characteristic of their known feeding ecology, which ranged from the consumption of soft-bodied insects (e.g., moths) by C. townsendii to the consumption of hard-bodied insects (e.g., beetles) by E. fuscus. Ultimately, the increased knowledge of the natural history of bats through multiple methods of data collection allows for a better understanding of complex arid ecosystems. It also provides resources needed for the management of habitat associated with alternative energy, such as uranium mining.",

This is particularly useful for cryptic and elusive animals, such as bats. Being able to identify critical habitat, such as maternity roosts, for bat species in areas where they depend on abandoned mines that could be slated for closure is necessary to enact appropriate protections for such roosts. In particular, Corynorhinus townsendii commonly uses abandoned mines for maternity roosts. Further, maternity roosts are difficult to identify through visual surveys when only one or a few surveys are performed before mine closures. We have developed a method for identification of C. townsendii maternity roosts that uses fecal DNA extracted from fresh guano collected from plastic sheeting placed at a mine entrance. We provide a multiplex PCR assay to amplify a control region fragment found only in C. townsendii, as well as a Y-linked protein (DBY) to detect male C. townsendii DNA. The purpose of this study was to identify a temporal shift in the presence of male C. townsendii bats, which can be useful to identify a maternity roost. This method allows for noninvasive identification of critical habitat for this species and reduces the effort and safety risk of entering mines on the part of biologists.",

Bats roosted in a large crevice in a rock face along the Missouri River, and 5 individuals were captured emerging from the opening of the crevice in March 2017. Our study is the first to confirm the use of a rock-crevice hibernaculum by M. septentrionalis and adds to the growing literature on the winter use of rock crevices by hibernating bats in North America. As white-nose syndrome (WNS) continues to spread across North America and decimate populations of M. septentrionalis, more knowledge of hibernation requirements is necessary to develop an effective recovery plan and to monitor this threatened species.",

However, less is known about the species’ status in the central and western parts of its range where WNS has arrived more recently. Here we report the timing of the arrival of Pd and WNS to eastern Nebraska and examine acoustic and capture data of M. septentrionalis to determine the initial impact of the disease on this species. We sampled bats for the presence of Pd and WNS at several mines and one rock crevice in eastern Nebraska from 2014 to 2017. We also recorded bats with acoustic detectors and captured bats with mist nets in spring and summer from 2014 to 2019 at 2 forested sites along the Missouri River near areas of sampling for Pd/WNS. Both acoustic and capture data suggested that M. septentrionalis went from a common species in forests of eastern Nebraska to one that is encountered rarely after the arrival of WNS. Similar to the population declines in the eastern United States, our observations indicate that M. septentrionalis has also declined steeply in the eastern Great Plains and should be closely monitored in western parts of its distribution as WNS continues to spread.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat populations are being impacted by many threats, including white-nose syndrome, wind energy development, and hibernaculum disturbance and modification. Understanding the use of caves as hibernacula by bats in the western United States is necessary for the conservation and management of these mammals and their habitat, as well as for monitoring the arrival of white-nose syndrome. We identified biologically important hibernacula from 304 winter surveys (1 November–31 March) in 64 caves from 1984 to 2016 in southern Idaho, USA. During surveys researchers counted 37,693 bats representing 6 species. Townsend’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii townsendii) comprised 96.1% (36,237 individuals in 58 caves) and western small-footed myotis (Myotis ciliolabrum ssp.) comprised 3.8% (1432 individuals in 22 caves). Thirty of the 64 caves were biologically important for Townsend’s bigeared bats (maximum count ≥20 individuals), and the largest hibernating colony of that species occupied cave C34 (8 surveys, x– = 1610 individuals, SD 415, range 962–1994). Thirteen caves were biologically important hibernacula for western small-footed myotis (maximum count ≥5 individuals), and the largest hibernating colony of that species occupied cave C24 (6 surveys, x– = 98 individuals, SD 53, range 32–152). Ten caves were biologically important hibernacula for both species. Our results indicate that Townsend’s big-eared bats are the predominant species that hibernate on the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho, and that this area has a high density of hibernacula—and the largest reported hibernaculum—for Townsend’s big-eared bats and western small-footed myotis in western North America. We recommend that biologists prioritize monitoring the 13 biologically important hibernacula of western small-footed myotis as well as the 10 caves used by both species for the potential arrival of white-nose syndrome in this area and to track the abundance of Townsend’s big-eared bats. Our results will help biologists with the management and conservation of bats and their habitat as well as aid in land use planning in this area.",

We examined the distributions of Myotis lucifugus (little brown myotis), Myotis septentrionalis (northern long-eared myotis), and Perimyotis subflavus (tri-colored bat) in eastern Nebraska by setting acoustic detectors for a single night at 105 sites in wooded habitats during summers of 2012 and 2014. We compared 2 methods of determining presence at each site. Results of our analyses are fine-scale distributional maps for these bats and some range extensions from published records. Results for M. septentrionalis and P. subflavus are largely consistent with previous reports. Results for M. lucifugus vary depending on the method of determining presence; however, our preferred method creates a pattern consistent with the known vouchered distribution of this species. The differences between published distributions of these species and distributions based on acoustic detection from our study might result from a lack of extensive netting in many areas of eastern Nebraska, underrepresentation of P. subflavus from mist net surveys in Nebraska, and a recent westward range expansion of P. subflavus and M. septentrionalis in southern Nebraska.",

Here we report on 3 new records of P. subflavus from southeastern New Mexico, including the first 2 records from winter and the first record from spring.

            "abstractNote": "Wind turbines are being deployed all across the world to meet the growing demand for energy, and in many areas, these turbines are causing the deaths of insectivorous migratory bats. One of the hypothesized causes of bat susceptibility is that bats are attracted to insects on or near the turbines. We examined insect remains in the stomachs and intestines of hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) found dead beneath wind turbines in New York and Texas to evaluate the hypothesis that bats die while feeding at turbines. Most of the bats we examined had full stomachs, indicating that they fed in the minutes to hours leading up to their deaths. However, we did not find prey in the mouths or throats of any bats that would indicate the bats died while capturing prey. Hoary bats fed mostly on moths, but we also detected the regular presence of beetles, true bugs, and crickets. Presence of terrestrial insects in stomachs indicates that bats may have gleaned them from the ground or the turbine surfaces, yet aerial capture of winged insect stages cannot be ruled out. Our findings confirm earlier studies that indicate hoary bats feed during migration and eat mostly moths. Future studies on bat behaviors and insect presence at wind turbines could help determine whether feeding at turbines is a major fatality risk for bats.",

For our study, we examined 202 individuals, 52 fresh hosts and 150 museum specimens, from New Mexico and southern Colorado for ectoparasites. We recorded 2158 ectoparasites, 634 from fresh hosts and 1524 from museum specimens. Ectoparasites belonged to 10 families and 13 genera of insect or acari and represent new host and locality records. In general, ectoparasites collected from fresh hosts and museum specimens were represented by 4 major species of mite: Macronyssus crosbyi, Alabidocarpus calcaratus, Acanthophthirius lucifugus, and Alabidocarpus nr. eptesicus. From our study, we found fresh hosts to have significantly greater prevalence values for Myodopsylla gentilis (flea), Chiroptonyssus robustipes (mite), and Leptotrombidium myotis (chigger), whereas museum specimens had significantly greater prevalence values for A. calcaratus (mite) and A. nr. eptesicus (mite). There were no significant differences between prevalence values for 4 mites including M. crosbyi, A. lucifugus, Pteracarus nr. minutus, and Cryptonyssus sp. Our study represents the only extensive study of ectoparasites on M. occultus and provides evidence for the importance of examining fresh hosts and museum specimens in future ectoparasite studies.",

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002/2003 in Asia, important efforts have been made to describe the diversity of Coronaviridae circulating in bats worldwide, leading to the discovery of the precursors of epidemic and pandemic sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats. We investigated the viral communities infecting horseshoe bats living in Northern Vietnam, and report here the ﬁrst identiﬁcation of sarbecoviruses in Rhinolophus thomasi and Rhinolophus siamensis bats. Phylogenetic characterization of seven strains of Vietnamese sarbecoviruses identiﬁed at least three clusters of viruses. Recombination and crossspecies transmission between bats seemed to constitute major drivers of virus evolution. Vietnamese sarbecoviruses were mainly enteric, therefore constituting a risk of spillover for guano collectors or people visiting caves. To evaluate the zoonotic potential of these viruses, we analyzed in silico and in vitro the ability of their RBDs to bind to mammalian ACE2s and concluded that these viruses are likely restricted to their bat hosts. The workﬂow applied here to characterize the spillover potential of novel sarbecoviruses is of major interest for each time a new virus is discovered, in order to concentrate surveillance efforts on high-risk interfaces.",

TRIM is a large family of proteins that participate in diverse cellular functions, such as antiviral immunity, DNA damage repair, tumor suppression, and aging. These functional areas appear to be highly consistent with the special characteristics of bats, such as tolerance to viruses and DNA damage generated in ﬂight, low cancer incidence, and longevity. However, there is still a lack of systematic study of the TRIM family in bats. Here, we explored the TRIM family of bats using the genomes of 16 representative species. The results showed that the bat TRIM family contains 70 members, with 24 under positive selection and 7 duplicated. Additional transcriptomic analysis revealed the tissue-speciﬁc expressions of TRIM9, 46, 54, 55, 63, and 72. Additionally, following interferon or viral stimulation, TRIM orthologs associated with antiviral immunity reported in humans were also upregulated in bat cells. The present study systematically analyzed the composition, evolution, and expression of bat TRIM genes. It may provide a theoretical basis for studies of bat TRIM in the ﬁelds of antiviral immunity, longevity, and tolerance to DNA damage.",

            "abstractNote": "We report the genetic characterization of two potentially novel rabies-related lyssaviruses identiﬁed from bats in Limpopo province, South Africa. Matlo bat lyssavirus (MBLV) was identiﬁed in two Miniopterus natalensis (Natal long-ﬁngered) bats in 2015 and 2016, and Phala bat lyssavirus (PBLV) was identiﬁed in a Nycticeinops schlieffeni (Schlieffen’s) bat in 2021. The distribution of both of these bat species is largely conﬁned to parts of Africa, with limited reports from the Arabian Peninsula. MBLV and PBLV were demonstrated to group with the unassigned and phylogroup I lyssaviruses, respectively. MBLV was most closely related to Lyssavirus caucasicus (WCBV), whereas PBLV was most closely related to Lyssavirus formosa (TWBLV-1) and Taiwan bat lyssavirus 2 (TWBLV-2), based on analysis of the N and G genes, the concatenated N + P + M + G + L coding sequence, and the complete genome sequence. Based on our analysis, MBLV and WCBV appeared to constitute a phylogroup separate from Lyssavirus lleida (LLEBV) and Lyssavirus ikoma (IKOV). Analysis of the antigenic sites suggests that PBLV will likely be serologically distinguishable from established lyssaviruses in virusneutralization tests, whereas MBLV appeared to be antigenically highly similar to WCBV. Taken together, the ﬁndings suggested that, while PBLV is likely a new lyssavirus species, MBLV is likely related to WCBV.",

Here, we report the detection and characterization of a reassortant MRV that was isolated from a bat colony in Xinjiang, China. The BtMRV showed a wide host and organ tropism and can efﬁciently propagate the cell lines of different animals. It caused mild damage in the lungs of the experimentally inoculated suckling mice and was able to replicate in multiple organs for up to three weeks post-inoculation. Complete genome analyses showed that the virus was closely related to MRVs in a wide range of animals. An intricate reassortment network was revealed between the BtMRV and MRVs of human, deer, cattle, civet and other bat species. Speciﬁcally, we found a bat-speciﬁc clade of segment M1 that provides a gene source for the reassortment of human MRVs. These data provide important insights to understand the diversity of MRVs and their natural circulation between bats, humans, and other animals. Further investigation and surveillance of MRV in bats and other animals are needed to control and prevent potential MRV-related diseases.",

To assess spillover risk, viromes of bats from different parts of the world have been investigated in the past. As opposed to most of these prior studies, which determined the bat virome at a single time point, the current work was performed to monitor changes over time. Speciﬁcally, fecal samples of three endemic Swiss bat colonies consisting of three different bat species were collected over three years and analyzed using next-generation sequencing. Furthermore, single nucleotide variants of selected DNA and RNA viruses were analyzed to investigate virus genome evolution. In total, sequences of 22 different virus families were found, of which 13 are known to infect vertebrates. Most interestingly, in a Vespertilio murinus colony, sequences from a MERS-related beta-coronavirus were consistently detected over three consecutive years, which allowed us to investigate viral genome evolution in a natural reservoir host.",

These differences clearly show lower incidence rates in several regions of the African and Asian continents. The work reported here aimed to test the hypothesis of a pre-pandemic natural immunity acquired by some human populations in central and western Africa, which would, therefore, pose the hypothesis of an original antigenic sin with a virus antigenically close to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To identify such pre-existing immunity, sera samples collected before the emergence of COVID-19 were tested to detect the presence of IgG reacting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 proteins of major signiﬁcance. Sera samples from French blood donors collected before the pandemic served as a control. The results showed a statistically signiﬁcant difference of antibodies prevalence between the collected samples in Africa and the control samples collected in France. Given the novelty of our results, our next step consists in highlighting neutralizing antibodies to evaluate their potential for pre-pandemic protective acquired immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, our results suggest that, in the investigated African sub-regions, the tested populations could have been potentially and partially pre-exposed, before the COVID-19 pandemic, to the antigens of a yet non-identiﬁed Coronaviruses.",

Some of them have been evidenced to cross species barriers and infect humans. Zoonotic HEV infections cause chronic liver diseases as well as a broad range of extrahepatic manifestations, which increasingly become signiﬁcant clinical problems. Bats comprise approximately one-ﬁfth of all named mammal species and are unique in their distinct immune response to viral infection. Most importantly, they are natural reservoirs of several highly pathogenic viruses, which have induced severe human diseases. Since the ﬁrst discovery of HEV-related viruses in bats in 2012, multiple genetically divergent HEV variants have been reported in a total of 12 bat species over the last decade, which markedly expanded the host range of the HEV family and shed light on the evolutionary origin of human HEV. Meanwhile, bat-borne HEV also raised critical public health concerns about its zoonotic potential. Bat HEV strains resemble genomic features but exhibit considerable heterogeneity. Due to the close evolutionary relationships, bat HEV altogether has been recently assigned to an independent genus, Chirohepevirus.

Herein, we describe genetic characterization of three novel rhabdoviruses from bats in China. Of these, two viruses (Jinghong bat virus and Benxi bat virus) found in Rhinolophus bats showed a phylogenetic relationship with vesiculoviruses, and sequence analyses indicate that they represent two new species within the genus Vesiculovirus. The remaining Yangjiang bat virus found in Hipposideros larvatus bats were only distantly related to currently known rhabdoviruses.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats have been identiﬁed as natural reservoirs of a variety of coronaviruses. They harbor at least 19 of the 33 deﬁned species of alpha- and betacoronaviruses. Previously, the bat coronavirus HKU10 was found in two bat species of different suborders, Rousettus leschenaultia and Hipposideros pomona, in south China. However, its geographic distribution and evolution history are not fully investigated. Here, we screened this viral species by a nested reverse transcriptase PCR in our archived samples collected over 10 years from 25 provinces of China and one province of Laos. From 8004 bat fecal samples, 26 were found to be positive for bat coronavirus HKU10 (BtCoV HKU10). New habitats of BtCoV HKU10 were found in the Yunnan, Guangxi, and Hainan Provinces of China, and Louang Namtha Province in Laos. In addition to H. pomona, BtCoV HKU10 variants were found circulating in Aselliscus stoliczkanus and Hipposideros larvatus. We sequenced full-length genomes of 17 newly discovered BtCoV HKU10 strains and compared them with previously published sequences. Our results revealed a much higher genetic diversity of BtCoV HKU10, particularly in spike genes and accessory genes. Besides the two previously reported lineages, we found six novel lineages in their new habitats, three of which were located in Yunnan province. The genotypes of these viruses are closely related to sampling locations based on polyproteins, and correlated to bat species based on spike genes. Combining phylogenetic analysis, selective pressure, and molecular-clock calculation, we demonstrated that Yunnan bats harbor a gene pool of BtCoV HKU10, with H. pomona as a natural reservoir. The cell tropism test using spike-pseudotyped lentivirus system showed that BtCoV HKU10 could enter cells from human and bat, suggesting a potential interspecies spillover. Continuous studies on these bat coronaviruses will expand our understanding of the evolution and genetic diversity of coronaviruses, and provide a prewarning of potential zoonotic diseases from bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats have been identiﬁed as a natural reservoir of a variety of coronaviruses (CoVs). Several of them have caused diseases in humans and domestic animals by interspecies transmission. Considering the diversity of bat coronaviruses, bat species and populations, we expect to discover more bat CoVs through virus surveillance. In this study, we described a new member of alphaCoV (BtCoV/Rh/YN2012) in bats with unique genome features. Unique accessory genes, ORF4a and ORF4b were found between the spike gene and the envelope gene, while ORF8 gene was found downstream of the nucleocapsid gene. All the putative genes were further conﬁrmed by reverse-transcription analyses. One unique gene at the 3’ end of the BtCoV/Rh/YN2012 genome, ORF9, exhibits ~30% amino acid identity to ORF7a of the SARS-related coronavirus. Functional analysis showed ORF4a protein can activate IFN-β production, whereas ORF3a can regulate NF-κB production. We also screened the spike-mediated virus entry using the spike-pseudotyped retroviruses system, although failed to ﬁnd any fully permissive cells. Our results expand the knowledge on the genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses. Continuous screening of bat viruses will help us further understand the important role played by bats in coronavirus evolution and transmission.",

            "abstractNote": "The lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) and the long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) are Aotearoa New Zealand’s only native extant terrestrial mammals and are believed to have migrated from Australia. Long-tailed bats arrived in New Zealand an estimated two million years ago and are closely related to other Australian bat species. Lesser short-tailed bats, in contrast, are the only extant species within the Mystacinidae and are estimated to have been living in isolation in New Zealand for the past 16–18 million years. Throughout this period of isolation, lesser short-tailed bats have become one of the most terrestrial bats in the world. Through a metatranscriptomic analysis of guano samples from eight locations across New Zealand, we aimed to characterise the viromes of New Zealand’s bats and determine whether viruses have jumped between these species over the past two million years. High viral richness was observed among long-tailed bats with viruses spanning seven different viral families. In contrast, no bat-specific viruses were identified in lesser short-tailed bats. Both bat species harboured an abundance of likely dietary- and environment-associated viruses. We also identified alphacoronaviruses in long-tailed bat guano that had previously been identified in lesser short-tailed bats, suggesting that these viruses had jumped the species barrier after long-tailed bats migrated to New Zealand. Of note, an alphacoronavirus species discovered here possessed a complete genome of only 22,416 nucleotides with entire deletions or truncations of several non-structural proteins, thereby representing what may be the shortest genome within the Coronaviridae identified to date. Overall, this study has revealed a diverse range of novel viruses harboured by New Zealand’s only native terrestrial mammals, in turn expanding our understanding of bat viral dynamics and evolution globally.",

            "abstractNote": "Over the last several decades, no emerging virus has had a profound impact on the world as the SARS-CoV-2 that emerged at the end of 2019 has done. To know where severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated from and how it jumped into human population, we immediately started a surveillance investigation in wild mammals in and around Wuhan when we determined the agent. Herein, coronaviruses were screened in the lung, liver, and intestinal tissue samples from fifteen raccoon dogs, seven Siberian weasels, three hog badgers, and three Reeves’s muntjacs collected in Wuhan and 334 bats collected around Wuhan. Consequently, eight alphacoronaviruses were identified in raccoon dogs, while nine betacoronaviruses were found in bats. Notably, the newly discovered alphacoronaviruses shared a high whole-genome sequence similarity (97.9 per cent) with the canine coronavirus (CCoV) strain 2020/7 sampled from domestic dog in the UK. Some betacoronaviruses identified here were closely related to previously known bat SARS-CoVrelated viruses sampled from Hubei province and its neighbors, while the remaining betacoronaviruses exhibited a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV-related bat viruses in the RdRp gene tree and clustered together with SARS-CoV-2-related bat coronaviruses in the M, N and S gene trees, but with relatively low similarity. Additionally, these newly discovered betacoronaviruses seem unlikely to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 because of the deletions in the two key regions of their receptor-binding motifs. Finally, we did not find SARS-CoV-2 or its progenitor virus in these animal samples. Due to the high circulation of CCoVs in raccoon dogs in Wuhan, more scientific efforts are warranted to better understand their diversity and evolution in China and the possibility of a potential human agent.",

This bat species feeds preferentially on bird blood, and there is limited information on the viruses infecting D. youngi. Hence, this study aimed to expand the knowledge about the viral diversity associated with D. youngi by sampling and pooling the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart, and intestines of all animals using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of three complete and 10 nearly complete circular virus genomes were closely related to gemykrogvirus (Genomoviridae family), smacovirus (Smacoviridae family), and torque teno viruses (TTVs) (Anelloviridae family). In addition, three sequences of bat paramyxovirus were detected and found to be closely related to viruses reported in Pomona roundleaf bats and rodents. The present study provides a snapshot of the viral diversity associated with white-winged vampire bats and provides a baseline for comparison to viruses detected in future outbreaks.",

This paper describes the spread of the rabies virus by the continuous diffusion model using relaxed random walks with BEAST software. Forty-one (41) sequences of gene G from the rabies virus that was isolated from bats and domestic herbivores from several areas of the state between 2006 and 2010 were analyzed. The phylogenetic tree showed three main clusters as well as two sub-clusters under cluster 2. A spatial analysis showed that three strains of the rabies virus spread independently. In general, central Esp´ırito Santo, which is mountainous, was the area where separation of the virus strains occurred. This physical barrier, however, was overcome at some point in time, as samples from different lineages were found in the same microarea.",

            "abstractNote": "Background:  Hendra virus (HeV) has caused lethal disease outbreaks in humans and horses in Australia. Flying foxes are the wildlife reservoir from which the virus was first isolated in 1996. Following a heat stress mortality event in Australian flying foxes in 2013, a novel HeV variant was discovered. This study describes the subsequent surveillance of Australian flying foxes for this novel virus over a nine year period using qRT-PCR testing of tissues from flying foxes submitted primarily for Australian bat lyssavirus diagnosis. Genome sequencing and characterisation of the novel HeV variant was also undertaken.\nMethods:  Spleen and kidney samples harvested from flying fox carcasses were initially screened with two realtime qRT-PCR assays specific for the prototype HeV. Two additional qRT-PCR assays were developed specific for the HeV variant first detected in samples from a flying fox in 2013. Next-generation sequencing and virus isolation was attempted from selected samples to further characterise the new virus.\nResults:  Since 2013, 98 flying foxes were tested and 11 were positive for the new HeV variant. No samples were positive for the original HeV. Ten of the positive samples were from grey-headed flying foxes (GHFF, Pteropus poliocephalus), however this species was over-represented in the opportunistic sampling (83% of bats tested were GHFF). The positive GHFF samples were collected from Victoria and South Australia and one positive Little red flying fox (LRFF, Pteropus scapulatus) was collected from Western Australia. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of henipavirus antigen, associated with an inflammatory lesion in cardiac blood vessels of one GHFF. Positive sam‑ples were sequenced and the complete genome was obtained from three samples. When compared to published HeV genomes, there was 84% sequence identity at the nucleotide level. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the newly detected HeV belongs to the HeV species but occupies a distinct lineage. We have therefore designated this virus HeV genotype 2 (HeV-g2). Attempts to isolate virus from PCR positive samples have not been successful.\nConclusions:  A novel HeV genotype (HeV-g2) has been identified in two flying fox species submitted from three states in Australia, indicating that the level of genetic diversity for HeV is broader than first recognised. Given its high genetic relatedness to HeV, HeV-g2 is a zoonotic pathogen.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Bats are natural reservoirs for several highly pathogenic and novel viruses including coronaviruses (CoVs) (mainly Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus). Lyle’s flying fox (Pteropus lylei)‘s roosts and foraging sites are usually in the proximity to humans and animals. Knowledge about age-specific pattern of CoV infection in P. lylei, prevalence, and viral shedding at roosts and foraging sites may have an impact on infection-age-structure model to control CoV outbreak.\nMethods: P. lylei bats were captured monthly during January–December 2012 for detection of CoV at three areas in Chonburi province; two human dwellings, S1 and S2, where few fruit trees were located with an open pig farm, 0.6 km and 5.5 km away from the bat roost, S3. Nested RT-PCR of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene from rectal swabs was used for CoV detection. The strain of CoV was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.\nResults: CoV infection was found in both juveniles and adult bats between May and October (January, in adults only and April, in juveniles only). Of total rectal swab positives (68/367, 18.5%), ratio was higher in bats captured at S1 (11/ 44, 25.0%) and S2 (35/99, 35.4%) foraging sites than at roost (S3) (22/224, 9.8%). Juveniles (forearm length ≤ 136 mm) were found with more CoV infection than adults at all three sites; S1 (9/24, 37.5% vs 2/20, 10%), S2 (22/49, 44.9% vs 13/ 50, 26.0%), and S3 (10/30, 33.3% vs 12/194, 6.2%). The average BCI of CoV infected bats was significantly lower than uninfected bats. No gender difference related to infection was found at the sites. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved RdRp gene revealed that the detected CoVs belonged to group D betacoronavirus (n = 64) and alphacoronavirus (n = 4).\nConclusions: The fact that CoV infection and shedding was found in more juvenile than adult bats may suggest transmission from mother during peripartum period. Whether viral reactivation during parturition period or stress is responsible in maintaining transmission in the bat colony needs to be explored.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: In recent years, novel hepadnaviruses, hepeviruses, hepatoviruses, and hepaciviruses have been discovered in various species of bat around the world, indicating that bats may act as natural reservoirs for these hepatitis viruses. In order to further assess the distribution of hepatitis viruses in bat populations in China, we tested the presence of these hepatitis viruses in our archived bat liver samples that originated from several bat species and various geographical regions in China.\nMethods: A total of 78 bat liver samples (involving two families, five genera, and 17 species of bat) were examined using nested or heminested reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) with degenerate primers. Full-length genomic sequences of two virus strains were sequenced followed by phylogenetic analyses.\nResults: Four samples were positive for hepadnavirus, only one was positive for hepevirus, and none of the samples were positive for hepatovirus or hepacivirus. The hepadnaviruses were discovered in the horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus sinicus and Rhinolophus affinis, and the hepevirus was found in the whiskered bat Myotis davidii. The full-length genomic sequences were determined for one of the two hepadnaviruses identified in R. sinicus (designated BtHBVRs3364) and the hepevirus (designated BtHEVMd2350). A sequence identity analysis indicated that BtHBVRs3364 had the highest degree of identity with a previously reported hepadnavirus from the roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pomona, from China, and BtHEVMd2350 had the highest degree of identity with a hepevirus found in the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, from Germany, but it exhibited high levels of divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino acid levels.\nConclusions: This is the first study to report that the Chinese horseshoe bat and the Chinese whiskered bat have been found to carry novel hepadnaviruses and a novel hepevirus, respectively. The discovery of BtHBVRs3364 further supports the significance of host switches evolution while opposing the co-evolutionary theory associated with hepadnaviruses. According to the latest criterion of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), we hypothesize that BtHEVMd2350 represents an independent genotype within the species Orthohepevirus D of the family Hepeviridae.",

While most studies of bat viromes focus on sampling seemingly healthy individuals, little is known about the viruses and bacteria associated with diseased bats. We performed traditional diagnostic techniques and metatranscriptomic sequencing on tissue samples from 43 Australian bats, comprising three flying fox (Pteropodidae) and two microbat species experiencing a range of disease syndromes, including mass mortality, neurological signs, pneumonia and skin lesions. Of note, we identified the recently discovered Hervey pteropid gammaretrovirus in a bat with lymphoid leukemia, with evidence of replication consistent with an exogenous virus. The possible association of Hervey pteropid gam­ maretrovirus with lymphoid leukemia clearly merits additional investigation. One novel picornavirus and at least three new astroviruses and bat pegiviruses were also identified in a variety of tissue types, as well as a number of likely bacterial pathogens or opportunistic infections, most notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are important reservoirs for viruses of public health and veterinary concern. Virus studies in Australian bats usually target the families Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae and Rhabdoviridae, with little known about their overall virome composition. We used metatranscriptomic sequencing to characterise the faecal virome of greyheaded flying foxes from three colonies in urban/suburban locations from two Australian states. We identified viruses from three mammalian-infecting (Coronaviridae, Caliciviridae, Retroviridae) and one possible mammalianinfecting (Birnaviridae) family. Of particular interest were a novel bat betacoronavirus (subgenus Nobecovirus) and a novel bat sapovirus (Caliciviridae), the first identified in Australian bats, as well as a potentially exogenous retrovirus. The novel betacoronavirus was detected in two sampling locations 1375 km apart and falls in a viral lineage likely with a long association with bats. This study highlights the utility of unbiased sequencing of faecal samples for identifying novel viruses and revealing broad-scale patterns of virus ecology and evolution.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Nipah virus (NiV) first emerged in Malaysia in 1998, with two bat species (Pteropus hypomelanus and P. vampyrus) as the putative natural reservoirs. In 2002, NiV IgG antibodies were detected in these species from Thailand, but viral RNA could not be detected for strain characterization. Two strains of NiV (Malaysia and Bangladesh) have been found in P. lylei in central Thailand, although Bangladesh strain, the causative strain for the outbreak in Bangladesh since 2001, was dominant. To understand the diversity of NiV in Thailand, this study identified NiV strain, using molecular characterizations, from P. hypomelanus in southern Thailand. Findings: Pooled bat urine specimens were collected from plastic sheet underneath bat roosts in April 2010, and then monthly from December 2010 to May 2011 at an island in southern Thailand. Five in 184 specimens were positive for NiV, using duplex nested RT-PCR assay on partial nucleocapsid fragment (357 bp). Whole sequences of nucleocapsid gene from four bats were characterized. All 5 partial fragments and 4 whole nucleocapsid genes formed a monophyletic with NiV-MY. Conclusions: Our study showed that P. hypomelanus in southern Thailand and from Malaysia, a bordering country, harbored similar NiV. This finding indicates that NiV is not limited to central Thailand or P. lylei species, and it may be a source of inter-species transmission. This indicates a higher potential for a widespread NiV outbreak in Thailand. NiV surveillance in Pteropus bats, the major natural reservoirs, should be conducted continuously in countries or regions with high susceptibility to outbreaks.",

            "abstractNote": "Many paramyxoviruses are responsible for a variety of mild to severe human and animal diseases. Based on the novel discoveries over the past several decades, the family Paramyxoviridae infecting various hosts across the world includes 4 subfamilies, 17 classiﬁed genera and 78 species now. However, no systematic surveys of bat paramyxoviruses are available from the Chinese mainland. In this study, 13,064 samples from 54 bat species were collected and a comprehensive paramyxovirus survey was conducted. We obtained 94 new genome sequences distributed across paramyxoviruses from 22 bat species in seven provinces. Bayesian phylodynamic and phylogenetic analyses showed that there were four different lineages in the Jeilongvirus genus. Based on available data, results of host and region switches showed that the bat colony was partial to interior, whereas the rodent colony was exported, and the felines and hedgehogs were most likely the intermediate hosts from Scotophilus spp. rather than rodents. Based on the evolutionary trend, genus Jeilongvirus may have originated from Mus spp. in Australia, then transmitted to bats and rodents in Africa, Asia and Europe, and ﬁnally to bats and rodents in America.",

In this report, we describe a 2-year-old female wild Cape serotine bat (Laephotis capensis) that had been caught by a domestic cat and presented with a skin mass over the chest area. Histopathological analysis of a subsequent biopsy revealed proliferating sheets of neoplastic round cells, occasionally appearing to form packets, supported by a fine, fibrovascular stroma. Marked nuclear pleomorphism was seen, as well as a high mitotic count. Immunohistochemistry displayed positive labelling for MUM1 in the neoplastic cells. The diagnosis was extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP); a neoplasm consisting of plasma cells derived from B lymphocytes. Due to a deteriorating condition, the bat was anaesthetised, and the mass was surgically removed two weeks later. However, the bat succumbed under the anaesthetic. Histopathological examination of the mass showed the same neoplastic cell population as observed in the biopsy; in addition, there was a locally extensive infiltration of neoplastic cells in the spleen and a mild presence of neoplastic cells in circulation. This is the first report of an EMP in a bat, and we compare the findings with that seen in dogs and cats.",

Our goal was to describe the diversity of bat-associated circoviruses and cirliviruses, thus, 424 bat samples from more than 80 species were collected on four continents. The samples were screened for circoviruses using PCR and the resulting amino acid sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis. The majority of bat strains were classified in the genus Circovirus and some strains in the genus Cyclovirus and the clades CRESS1 and CRESS3. Some strains, however, could only be classified at the taxonomic level of the order and were not classified in any of the accepted or proposed clades. In the family Circoviridae, 71 new species have been predicted. This screening of bat samples revealed a great diversity of circoviruses and cirliviruses. These studies underline the importance of the discovery and description of new cirliviruses and the need to establish new species and families in the order Cirlivirales.",

The predominant species involved were dogs (299; 91.2%) and cats (12; 3.7%). Other species included pigs (4; 1.2%), goats (4; 1.2%), monkeys (4; 1.2%), sheep (2; 0.6%), bats (2; 0.6%) and cattle (1; 0.3%). The numbers of reported cases in animals were markedly higher than those in humans except in 2013 and 2017. There was a positive but weak correlation between cases in animals and humans which could be due to lack of reporting collaboration between institutions responsible for these. Greater Accra and Ashanti Regions were identified as hotspots in the period under review, while January and August were the months with the highest peaks for cases reported. Cases reported in rainy season were significantly higher than those in dry season. Poisson regression for spatio-temporal analyses showed no statistical significance in predicting number of rabies cases (response variable) from year, month, season, region and affected species (predictor variables).\nConclusion: Rabies remained endemic in Ghana during 2010–2017 with cases reported in nearly every month of the year during this period. There was a significant seasonal pattern with higher proportion of cases reported in the rainy/wet season compared to the dry season.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Kaeng Khoi virus (KKV), which belongs to the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Perbunyaviridae, was originally isolated from the brain tissue of bats and may cause infection in humans. In this study, the KKV strain WDBC1403 was isolated from bat ﬂies (Eucampsipoda sundaica), ectoparasites of the bat Rousettus leschenaultia, collected from Yunnan Province of China at the Sino-Burmese border.\nMethods and Results: The bat ﬂy specimens were ground and inoculated in culture cells. The WDBC1403 strain was shown to induce cytopathic effects in Vero, baby hamster kidney (BHK-21), and Tb1Lu cells, but not in C6/36 cells; however, viral gene ampliﬁcation was detected in the supernatants of C6/36 cells. Using electron microscopy, the virus was determined to be spherical, enveloped, and 80–90 nm in diameter; it was also shown to form plaques in BHK-21 cells and the titer reached 1 · 106.57 plaque-forming units/mL 24 h after infection. The phylogenetic analysis showed that WDBC1403 is a KKV strain, but is independent of the original KKV strain (PSC-19). Viral genome analysis revealed that the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the S, M, and L segments of WDBC1403 with PSC-19 were 88.2% and 96.1%, 76.7% and 85.0%, and 78.3% and 88.9%, respectively. Two amino acids were removed at the end of the open reading frame of the M segment, and 47 nucleotides were removed in the 3¢-untranslated region of the M segment of the WDBC1403 strain compared with the PSC-19 strain.\nConclusions: The WDBC1403 strain is a highly divergent KKV strain, suggesting that there are a variety of KKV strains that exhibit molecular differences. Moreover, because of the large variations in nucleotide and amino acid sequence in the M segment, which encodes an important membrane protein, further research on antigenicity and pathogenicity in humans and animals is needed.",

Over the past two decades, the so-called invasions of this species have been observed in buildings in Košice. This unusual behaviour occurs in late summer or autumn and it is characterized by numerous accidental or unforeseen occurrences of bats in various spaces of these houses. It has been hypothesised that these events are related to bats swarming and hibernating in the Erňa cave; however, causality has not been confirmed. We measured the relative activity of bats from the end of the breeding season through the invasions and autumn swarming prior to the onset of hibernation by recording their echolocation calls on car-based transects in order to find any spatial and temporal linkage between activity in the urban area and the swarming site. Over two years we recorded 6,253 sequences with echolocation calls of P. pipistrellus and 5,239 records of other bats along four transects totalling 7,121 km in length. Spatial pattern analysis found that the city agglomeration presented a local hotspot of the species’ activity, especially during the invasion season. Multivariate generalised additive modelling confirmed an increased density of records of P. pipistrellus between the urban area and the hibernaculum in the pre-hibernation season, whereas this pattern was not found to be consistent on the control transects near the city. Contrary to that, other bat species showed little variation in their activity between transects and seasons. The obtained results suggest that the relatively short geographical distance between the urban agglomeration and the large swarming site is likely a clue to the frequent city invasions of the species, although the role of the city as a hibernation area cannot be completely omitted.",

            "abstractNote": "A positive correlation between cave size and bat diversity has been recorded by some authors for different cave areas in South America. We analyzed published and otherwise available data from three Brazilian karst areas and phytogeography domains, including NE and SE Atlantic Forest and Cerrado (savannah-like vegetation), encompassing a wide range of cave sizes. We found no such correlation, as expected in view of previous observations by researchers and speleologists. We discuss the ecological implications of different ways to measure bat diversity, i.e. the accumulative number of species (sequential use of caves) vs. the number of species at a given occasion (species in actual cohabitation) vs. bat abundance (numbers of individuals), as well as speleological topics related to the concept of caves (based on an anthropomorphic definition, not applicable to other species), the problems of estimating topographic variables such as cave area and volume, and the value of including cave temperatures in the analyses. Multiple interacting variables may influence the composition of cave bat communities and bat species richness and abundance. The most important ones would be the density of caves in a given area (related to lithology – calcareous vs. siliciclastic caves), regional climates, and degree of preservation of epigean habitat. Cave morphology, number and size of entrances, and presence of water bodies, as well as interactions with other species, must also be considered. In conclusion, as a general statement for tropical and subtropical bats, cave size (in the human sense) by itself does not matter, except perhaps for one-off situations. Finally, a brief overview of the diversity of cave bats in Brazil is presented.",

            "abstractNote": "A study of the mammals in the riverine forests along the Jubba River in southern Somalia, was conducted between July and September 1986. Thirty-two species of mammals were recorded, although some of the mammals only use the forests seasonally. Several species were hunted in the forest, the most important being waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus Ogilby 1833, bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus Pallas 1766 and red forest duiker Cephalophus natalensis A. Smith 1834. Several species that are rare or restricted in distribution within Somalia occur in these forests, notably the bats Pipistrellus eisentrauti Hill 1968 and Nycteris parisii De Beaux 1923, leopard Panthera pardus Linnaeus 1758 and blue monkey Cercopithecus mitis Wolf 1822, as well as others whose numbers are declining, such as waterbuck and red forest duiker. The Jubba forests are therefore of considerable conservation value, particularly since they represent the largest areas of riverine forest left in Somalia. In view of the small size and rapid rate of disappearence of these forests urgent action is needed to conserve the remaining mammal populations.",

This advocates the necessity of wildlife and resource inventories be conducted at available forested areas, promoting steady improvement in the existing conservation and management plans, especially for threatened taxa such as the small mammals. Small mammals surveys was conducted at Tasik Bera, Ulu Gombak Forest Reserve, Sungkai Wildlife Conservation Centre, Penang Island, and Wang Kelian State Park. Harp traps, mist-nets, cage traps and pitfall traps were set during the surveys. Rhinolophus affinis was the most abundant (N = 61) volant small mammal, followed by Rhinolophus lepidus (N = 27). Meanwhile, the most abundant non-volant small mammal are Leopoldamys sabanus (N = 33), followed by Maxomys rajah (N = 25), and Tupaia glis (N = 22). Two species of shrews, Suncus etruscus and Crocidura monticola were caught as singletons. The results indicated that Ulu Gombak Forest Reserve has the highest species diversity (H’ = 2.754), whereas Penang Island recorded the lowest (H’ = 2.245). The species lists of small mammals generated from the survey will be significant for various stakeholders’ conservation and monitoring plans.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are known as potential carriers of different pathogens; these animals have been identified worldwide as an important reservoir of different species of Leptospira. Therefore, there has been an increasing interest in studying leptospirosis in neotropical bats in the Amazon. This region is a fertile ground for zoonotic diseases, given the intense process of deforestation, urbanization, opening of new agricultural frontiers, predatory hunting, effects of climate change, and loss of biodiversity. Based on this, the aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency of infection associated with the genetic characterization of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in bats inhabiting diverse landscapes in the southwestern region of the Amazon. To conduct the study, mist nets were installed to capture bats. Kidney samples were submitted to LipL32-polymerase chain reaction and secY gene sequencing. Our results showed that 21% of neotropical evaluated bats in Southwestern Amazon were infected with Leptospira spp. Positive animals were found in rural, urban, periurban, and control areas. Sanguinivores had the highest frequency of positives, followed by insectivores and frugivorous bats. The species of L. interrogans and a potential new Leptospira species were identified. The frequency of Leptospira in bats was not influenced by landscape type, suggesting these pathogens may not be affected by landscape changes. The findings suggest that bats may serve as potential reservoirs of Leptospira in diverse landscapes. The presence of Leptospira in bats appears to be independent of the type of land use, implying that these pathogens may not be affected by small-scale changes in the environment.",

            "abstractNote": "Climate change is one of the drivers of wildlife-borne disease emergence, as it can affect species abundance and fitness, host immunocompetence, and interactions with pathogens. To detect emerging wildlife-borne diseases, countries may implement general wildlife-disease surveillance systems. Such surveillance exists in the Netherlands. However, it is unclear how well it covers host species vulnerable to climate change and consequently disease emergence in these species. Therefore, we performed a trait-based vulnerability assessment (TVA) to quantify species vulnerability to climate change for 59 Dutch terrestrial mammals. Species’ vulnerability was estimated based on the magnitude of climatic change within the species’ distribution (exposure), the species’ potential to persist in situ (sensitivity), and the species’ ability to adjust (adaptive capacity). Using these vulnerability categories, we identified priority species at risk for disease emergence due to climate change. Subsequently, we assessed the frequency of occurrence of these priority species compared to other mammal species examined in general wildlife disease surveillance during 2008–2022. We identified 25% of the mammal species to be highly exposed, 24% to be highly sensitive, and 22% to have a low adaptive capacity. The whiskered myotis and the garden dormouse were highly vulnerable (i.e., highly exposed, highly sensitive, and low adaptive capacity), but they are rare in the Netherlands. The Western barbastelle, the pond bat, and the Daubenton’s myotis were potential adapters (highly exposed, highly sensitive, and high adaptive capacity). Species vulnerable to climate change were relatively poorly represented in current general surveillance. Our research shows a comprehensive approach that considers both exposures to climate change and ecological factors to assess vulnerability. TVAs, as presented in this study, can easily be adapted to include extra drivers and species, and we would therefore recommend surveillance institutes to consider integrating these types of assessments for evaluating and improving surveillance for wildlife-borne disease emergence.",

            "abstractNote": "Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis that occurs in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Chiroptera are known to be a formidable reservoir of zoonotic pathogens, including leptospires. The epidemiology of leptospirosis in bats in the Pacific Islands is poorly known, both in terms of prevalence and in terms of the bacterial strains involved. A strong host specificity between leptospiral strains and their mammalian reservoir is recognized. This phenomenon has notably been studied recently in bat communities, providing strong evidence of co-evolution. In New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot where leptospirosis is endemic and enzootic, Chiroptera are the only indigenous terrestrial mammals. In this study, we aimed to investigate leptospires associated with three flying fox species in New Caledonia. Kidneys and urine samples of Pteropus spp. from captures and seizures were analysed. Among 254 flying foxes analysed, 24 harboured pathogenic leptospires corresponding to an observed prevalence of 9.45% with 15.8% on the Main Island and 4.3% on Loyalty Islands. The analysis of the rrs gene, lfb1, and MLST sequences evidenced four distinct clusters of undescribed strains, likely corresponding to undescribed species. All four strains belong to the Group I of pathogenic Leptospira spp., which includes Leptospira interrogans, Leptospira noguchii, and Leptospira kirschneri. We detected pathogenic leptospires in all three Pteropus spp. studied (including two endemic species) with no evidence of host specificity in two co-roosting species. For a better understanding of Leptospira–host co-evolution, notably to genetically characterize and evaluate the virulence of these original bat-associated leptospires, it is essential to improve isolation techniques. Flying foxes are traditionally hunted and eaten in New Caledonia, a massive cause of bat–human interactions. Our results should encourage vigilance during these contacts to limit the spillover risk of these pathogens to humans.",
