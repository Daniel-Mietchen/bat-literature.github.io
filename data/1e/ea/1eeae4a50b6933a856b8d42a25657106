With many passageways in the cavern that are closer to surface openings, we investigated why females selected a remote area to bear and raise young. Using radiotransmitters and light tags, we determined that bats traveled 1.8 or 2.1 km, depending on which of only two openings was used to exit the cavern. Air temperatures in the passageway containing the maternity colony and adjacent rooms were the warmest in the cavern, and air moisture also was greater in those areas. Warm and stable air temperatures, high humidity, low predation risk, and infrequent human disturbances were advantages of the roost site. For this colony of M. thysanodes, such advantages seemed to outweigh energetic costs and other disadvantages of commuting to a remote area of the cavern on a nightly basis.",

Our study deals with social call structure of a recently discovered species, Pipistrellus hanaki. Because it shares a common ancestor with P. pygmaeus, we hypothesized that as in the other species from this group social call structure in P. hanaki retains the basic design observed in other bats from the same genus. We also hypothesized that as in other pipistrelles such calls fulfill context-dependent functions, being used by both foraging and mating bats for different purposes. However, we found that these calls have a structure rather different from that seen in most pipistrelles. Two different types of multi-harmonic, broad-band and long-duration social calls were identified, with distinctive temporal structures. Single component, frequency modulated-quasi constant frequency (FM-QCF) calls were emitted during summer at foraging sites where feeding buzzes were regularly produced. In autumn, when feeding buzz rates decreased and males caught at recording sites had prominent testes, a second type of single or multi-component calls with a fluctuating frequency over time was more frequent. Unlike the typical multi-component social calls recorded in several Pipistrellus species, our results suggest that social calls used by foraging or mating P. hanaki have markedly different structures. Because social calls of bats are speciesspecific and may function in reproductive isolation, we hypothesize that differentiation of social calls in P. hanaki has been associated with the divergence of this species from P. pygmaeus.",

Considering the microbiota–host as a unity, in which extrinsic (as food availability and geography) or intrinsic factors (as physiology) play an important role in the microbiota composition, we would expect differentiation in the microbiota of two geographically separated populations. The Amplicon Sequences Variants (ASVs) of the V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene from 68 individuals were analyzed using alpha and beta diversity metrics. We obtained a total of 11 566 (ASVs). The bacterial communities in the Central and Pacific populations had a diversity of 6,939 and 4,088 ASVs, respectively, sharing a core microbiota of 539 ASVs accounting for 75% of the relative abundance, suggesting stability over evolutionary time. The Weighted UniFrac metrics tested by a PERMANOVA showed that lactating and pregnant females had significant beta diversity differences in the two populations compared with other reproductive stages. This could be a consequence of the increased energy requirements of these physiological stages, more than the variation due to geographical separation. In contrast, a positive correlation of the observed ASVs of fecal microbiota with the observed ASVs of plastids related to the diet was observed in the juveniles and adults, suggesting that in these physiological stages an extrinsic factor as the diet shapes the microbiota composition. The results provide a baseline for future studies of the microbiome in these two wild populations of the lesser long-nosed bat, the main pollinator of the Agaves from which the beverages tequila and mezcal are made.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats from the genus Vampyressa Thomas, 1900 are known from a relatively small number of individuals in Mexico. Through recent collecting efforts in southwestern Mexico, we detected several previously unknown populations of Vampyressa, which appeared to represent a lineage independent from but closely related to V. thyone. Here, we describe this lineage as a new species of the genus Vampyressa from the Mexican states of Guerrero and Oaxaca. The new species is currently known from at least 8 collected specimens and 3 released individuals from 8 localities, and can be differentiated from V. pusilla and V. thyone based on pelage and skull characters, size, mitochondrial Cytochrome b, and nuclear Recombination-activating gene 2 sequence data. The new species has been captured mainly in the lowlands but occurs along a wide altitudinal range from 150 to 2,200 m above sea level. Most of the records of the new species are from west of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, which evidences a new case of a phylogenetic break at this biogeographic barrier. The genus Vampyressa now includes 6 species, and Mexico expands its position as the country with the largest number of endemic bats in the Neotropics, totaling 20 endemics.",

This has led to uncertainties about the distribution of the species, that was once considered an Atlantic Forest endemic. Based on an analysis of a large and geographically restricted series of P. recifinus, we assessed the individual variation in the species and provide useful characters to separate it from P. lineatus. We reviewed the locality records of P. recifinus, and carried out an ecological niche model analysis in order to update the species polygon and calculate its area of habitat. After removing misidentifications, we found that the species occurs in moist forests from sea level to 1653 m. The area of suitable habitat estimated for the species was 402,225.2 Km2, ranging from the Brazilian states of Ceará to Santa Catarina. Both empirical records and ecological niche model analyses reinforce that P. recifinus should be considered an Atlantic Forest endemic. The species is present in moist forest enclaves in the Caatinga, but these formations are part of the Atlantic Forest domain.",

Based on specimens deposited in Venezuelan museums, we report the first record of T. lavali for the Guiana Shield and the second record for the Venezuelan Llanos. The external and cranial measurements of the analyzed specimens fall within the range previously reported for T. lavali; likewise, the qualitative characters are similar to what is known for the species. Additionally, derived from a search of records in databases, we report the first specimens of Thyroptera discifera for the Orinoco river basin. We confirm the presence of three species in Venezuela: T. discifera, distributed in the Cordillera de la Costa and Central and Western Llanos; Thryoptera tricolor, occurring in the Andes, Deltaic System and the Guiana Shield and T. lavali, recorded in the Eastern Llanos, Deltaic System and the Guiana Shield.",

            "abstractNote": "Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance is a global health threat. It has been studied in humans and domestic animals, but there is a lack of data on wild animals. The objective of this study is the elucidation of its patterns in Staphylococcus spp. isolated from wild mammals of the Autonomous Community of Aragón (Spain). Material and Methods: A total of 103 mammals (Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Chiroptera, Erinaceomorpha, and Lagomorpha) were studied. A recovery centre provided 32 and hunting 71. Nasal and faecal samples yielded 111 staphylococci, which were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry. A susceptibility test to 11 antibiotics was carried out, and statistical analysis was performed. Results: Some differences were detected in bacterial prevalence depending on how the mammal fed. Artiodactyla, mainly hunted, were predisposed to carry coagulase-positive staphylococci. The staphylococci species recovered were resistant to at least two classes of antibiotics, and were disseminated in all of the geographical areas studied. Conclusion: Resistant staphylococci are widely distributed in the wild mammals in the areas of the study, but the resistance quantified in them is lower than that to be expected if the use of antibiotics in farms had a direct influence on the wildlife and its environment. On the other hand, resistance to antibiotics restricted to human use was widely disseminated in various wild animal species.",

Here, using footage from a high-speed camera, the first comparative study of the performance during the wing induced phase of take-off in six insectivorous bat species is described. Despite distinct differences in foraging strategy, the mass specific power generated by the bats during wing induced take-off did not differ between species, with the exception of Myotis capaccinii. This suggests that differences in take-off performance may only be evident in bats that exhibit particularly unusual foraging strategies, such as the trawling behaviour of M. capaccinii – with differences in the remaining species only manifesting in subtler aspects of flight performance such as agility or manoeuvrability. The poorer take-off performance of M. capaccinii could be related to either a reduction in wing-stroke amplitude to stop the wings hitting the water’s surface during foraging or perhaps an effect of having very large feet. No scaling relationship between body mass and mass-specific take-off power was found, which supports earlier research on birds and insects, suggesting that the mass-specific muscle power available for flight is broadly similar across a large range of body sizes and species.",

Recent molecular genetic analysis did not support this view since each of the two species was found to belong to another clade. The present paper is based on the analysis of eight external and 12 cranial characters in a sample of 158 M. daubentonii and 113 M. lucifugus, both species being represented by their nominate subspecies. Student t-test and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to test the variability and the impact of characters on interspecific differences. Significant sexual dimorphism was found mainly in M. daubentonii (females larger), hence in further analyses, males were separated from females. In both sexes, significant specific differences were found in most of the measurements, M. lucifugus having higher population averages than M. daubentonii. Only ca. 50% of variability was observed on the first two principal component axes in external characters but positive loadings suggested longer ears and tragi in M. lucifugus and negative loadings – longer feet and toe claws in M. daubentonii. PCA performed on cranial measurements provided ca. 70% of variability in each sexe. Insignificant specific differences on the first axis, influenced mainly by length variables of the skull including toothrows and mandible, suggest adaptations to analogous foraging strategies and diets. The projection of specimens onto the second and third principal components demonstrated significant differences between the species; these two axes were dominated by breadth and height of braincase, and interorbital constriction, respectively. The difference in the shape of neurocrania suggests different phylogenetic history in each of the species. The two bats are typical vicariants but their hunting habits do not seem to be identical, M. daubentonii appears to be more adapted to glean the water surface than M. lucifugus.",

The work detailed in this article tested whether pups learn about novel food from interactions with their mothers during foraging and develop preferences. Mother-pup pairs or pups alone were trained during postnatal days (PND) 46–50 using Mangifera indica as a novel fruit. They were then tested during PND 61–65 for food preferences in relation to a known fruit (Achras sapota) and the novel fruit (M. indica). When the trained pups and untrained pups were tested for food preferences independently, those trained with the mother were found to exhibit significantly more marked preferences for the novel fruit as compared with either the pups trained without their mothers or the untrained pups. They made a greater number of feeding attempts and bouts in respect of the novel fruit. However, pups trained without their mothers and untrained pups also both showed a response to the novel fruit during the later period of testing. The results suggest that mother-pup interactions during the early foraging period may provide an opportunity for C. sphinx pups to learn about novel food sources thanks to their mother. Later they may learn independently on the basis of experience from mother’s milk and/or social interaction with conspecifics.",

This study suggests there is a sizable difference in the thermal imaging population size estimates of free-tailed bats at Oklahoma maternity roosts compared to historical estimates using other methods. These differences might be due to the improved accuracy of thermal imaging, or because there is a real decline in bat numbers in Oklahoma, or both.",

Night-roosts were used from May to October, with their peak in August. The bats began to use night-roosts at about 80 min after sunset, and left the roosts at about 70 min before sunrise. Solitary roosts were almost exclusively occupied by males, while colonies at the night-roosts consisted of females and/or young, and attained the maximal size of 30 bats in August. The night-roosts were warmer than ambient at night, and firstly provided sites for resting between feeding bouts, promoting digestion of food or absorption of nourishment. The duration of roosting bouts at night varied from 0.5 to 7.6 hrs, and became longer in September. Adult females and males occupied different night-roosts in general. Females of P. abramus were faithful to particular night-roosts, while males did not defend night-roosts, and frequently changed their roosts. Copulation did not occur at the night-roosts.",

The average genetic divergence between reciprocally monophyletic M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus was 5.6% on ND2 and 3.5% on Cytb. In all phylogenetic trees, the clade with M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus was placed within Palearctic-Ethiopian Miniopterus taxa. There was a considerable genetic divergence (ca. 8% in Cytb) between M. s. pallidus from Israel and M. s. pallidus from Turkey, Iran, and Nagorno-Karabakh, indicating that they probably are not the same taxon. Time to the most recent common ancestor of M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus was estimated to be between 1.98 to 0.60 Myr BP (ND2 data) and between 1.95 to 0.45 Myr BP (Cytb data).",

We assessed genetic diversity of these colonies, quantified differences between them, and pointed out to their putative ancestral origin. Our results suggest that the extant European populations of M. schreibersii are descendants of the ancestors that survived the last glacial maximum in a single glacial refugium, probably located in the north-western Anatolia. According to our model, a rapid population expansion and major re-colonization events started after the climatic change that followed the end of the last glacial maximum. Our suggestions are supported by the shallow genetic differentiation between the eastern and western colonies of M. schreibersii, high genetic diversity observed in the eastern colonies, and population expansion time estimated for ca. 15.6 kyr BP.",

This activity (nocturnal and seasonal), measured as the number of social and echolocation calls recorded along a 2 km convoluted transect, was lowest in April, May and June. In July, vocal activity increased to reach its highest level during August and September. Throughout the study, calls were emitted in the early part of the night from May through June, then switched to the latter part of the evening in August. Seasonally, the number of calls correlated positively with the air temperature; no significant relationship was found between the level of social and echolocation calls, and relative humidity or atmospheric pressure. I consider that these changes in vocal activity in July were associated with the onset of the mating period, when the males emitted social calls during an advertisement display or from the roosts, performed to attract females for harem formation. The calls of P. nathusii emitted outside the mating period may also have played another social function.",

            "abstractNote": "Subterranean swarming of bats takes place in the autumn and it is presumed that its main function is to facilitate mating. However, Plecotus auritus (brown long-eared bat) swarms twice a year, in spring (in March and April), and in autumn (from the end of August to October). The premise that both the autumn and spring swarming events have a mating function was tested by measuring the vocalisation activity and reproductive state of males at two subterranean swarming sites and at several maternity colony roosts in southwestern Poland. Vocal activity, as defined by the number of social calls emitted by swarming bats, was about ten times higher in the spring than in the autumn. The bats also emitted a wider range of call types in spring. From 45 to 100% of males examined in spring had distended caudae epididymides. Enlarged and distended epididymes contain spermatozoa and indicate that males are still able to copulate in spring. There was a significant positive correlation between the proportion of males with distended caudae epididymides and the vocal activity of swarming bats. This indicates that swarming behaviour plays a role in mating and that the mating season extends from autumn to spring. For the first time, a biphasic pattern of active mating behaviour has been observed in a European bat species. Mating occurs during swarming in autumn and spring and is accompanied by vocal advertisement. We suggest that the low number of females in spring increases competition between males and significantly increases the amount and diversity of vocal activity.",

            "abstractNote": "Age-related telomere shortening is considered a hallmark of the ageing process. However, a recent cross-sectional ageing study of relative telomere length (rTL) in bats failed to detect a relationship between rTL and age in the long-lived genus Myotis (M. myotis and M. bechsteinii), suggesting some other factors are responsible for driving telomere dynamics in these species. Here, we test if longitudinal rTL data show signatures of age-associated telomere attrition in M. myotis and differentiate which intrinsic or extrinsic factors are likely to drive telomere length dynamics. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, rTL was measured in 504 samples from a marked population, from Brittany, France, captured between 2013 and 2016. These represent 174 individuals with an age range of 0 to 7+ years. We find no significant relationship between rTL and age (p = .762), but demonstrate that within-individual rTL is highly variable from year to year. To investigate the heritability of rTL, a population pedigree (n = 1744) was constructed from genotype data generated from a 16-microsatellite multiplex, designed from an initial, low-coverage, Illumina genome for M. myotis. Heritability was estimated in a Bayesian, mixed model framework, and showed that little of the observed variance in rTL is heritable (h2 = 0.01–0.06). Rather, correlations of first differences, correlating yearly changes in telomere length and weather variables, demonstrate that, during the spring transition, average temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall and windspeed correlate with changes in longitudinal telomere dynamics. As such, rTL may represent a useful biomarker to quantify the physiological impact of various environmental stressors in bats.",

The bats mainly preferred dead banana leaves as day-roosts, while leaves of sugar cane or broad-leaved trees were occasionally used. They frequently switched their day-roosts every one to four days. ­Families numbering three bats (adult female, adult male, and young) were found in Feb­ ruary, June, September and October. However, such families were not found in November and ­December when pairs constituted 64% of the total number of captured bats. Most of the pairs roosted together in day-roosts, and did not change their partners during the survey period each year. Foraging areas between contiguous pairs did not overlap each other. Foraging areas averaged 6.1 ha for males and 5.6 ha for females. Kerivoula picta fed chiefly on relatively small-sized web-building spiders. Most of the pairs changed partner every year. The recapture rates of newly banded bats after one year averaged 20%, and the oldest ages recorded were five years for females and four years for males.",

Parturition occurred in early June. Forearm length of newborn young averaged 16.5 mm in females and 16.3 mm in males, and their body weight averaged 2.4 g. The newborn young at a few days of age were left alone or in a small loose cluster at night. However, mothers returned to the nursery roost from foraging one or two hrs after sunset and embraced their young until sunset, while mothers embraced them three hrs after sunset at colonyforming stage. From newborn to colony-forming stage, forearm length and body weight of young increased noticeably, whereas from colony forming to flying stage growth rates slightly slowed down, especially the rates being more marked in a large colony than in a small colony. From flapping to flying stage, there were two peaks of mother’s embracing behavior at night, while most of the young clustered tightly and formed a large colony. Fundamental frequency of calls in a few-day-old young averaged 19.8 kHz. From newborn to colony-forming stage, the number of harmonics reduced 5–6 to 3–4 in both the oral and nasal calls. At flapping stage, oral calls with two or three syllables, contained two or three harmonics, and their fundamental frequency averaged 32.1 kHz, while nasal calls contained only two harmonics, and their frequency averaged 42.6 kHz. At flying stage, young emitted nasal pure tone CF-FM or FM-CF-FM calls, and the second harmonic became more intense than the first one. The dominant frequency of CF-components from flying to self-supporting stage is negatively correlated with the size of forearm length.",

            "abstractNote": "Generalized pollination systems may be favored in early spring flowering plants, as during this period pollinator activity is unpredictable. Many previous studies have concentrated on the importance of diurnal visitors in pollination, and consequently, information on the contribution of nocturnal visitors to pollination in early spring is limited. This study was conducted to evaluate the relative importance of diurnal and nocturnal pollinators in the early spring flowering dioecious shrub Stachyurus praecox (Stachyuraceae), in two temperate forests in central Japan. Visitors to the female and male flowers were observed during day and night, and their relative contributions to seed set were compared. The pollinator observations revealed that the diurnal and nocturnal insects visited both male and female flowers, and that the main flower visitors were diurnal small bees and flies as well as nocturnal settling moths. The diurnal and nocturnal flower visitors also acted as pollinators, as the pollen grains of S. praecox were attached to the insects collected from the female flowers. Pollination experiments demonstrated that the contributions of diurnal pollinators to the seed set were higher than those of the nocturnal pollinators. The results of this study indicate that S. praecox has a generalized pollination system, comprising both diurnal insects and nocturnal settling moths. Although the roles of diurnal insects are more important in the pollination of S. praecox, nocturnal settling moths may have a complementary role in early spring.",

PCR amplification and sequencing of the first hypervariable domain of the mitochondrial control region were used to obtain the genetic data.

The lineages showed a considerable sequence divergence of\n              c\n              . 9%, accompanied by a corresponding difference in forearm length. The presence of the genetically distinct lineages, with allopatric distribution and corresponding morphometric differences, probably reflects their long isolation during the ice‐age in the Balkans and the Caspian/Caucasus refugia, followed subsequently by expansion into different habitats. Based on the present data, the lineages can be recognized as evolutionary significant units.",

These are termed the 55 kHz and 45 kHz phonic types here for simplicity. Songflight calls produced by males in the mating season, probably to attract females, differed between the two phonic types in the number of components in the calls and the call parameters measured. Songflight calls of the 55 kHz phonic type, which generally consisted of three components, were of higher frequencies than those of the 45 kHz phonic type, usually of four components. There were also significant differences in call parameters among individuals. A discriminant analysis of songflight calls classified 100% of individuals to the correct phonic type. The relationships between echolocation call frequency and songflight call frequency differed significantly between phonic types. Social calls produced during flight also differed between phonic types, in the number of components and call parameters measured. Social calls were compared to songflight calls of each phonic type. Social calls of the 55 kHz phonic type did not differ significantly from songflight calls; there were small but significant differences between the two types of calls of the 45 kHz phonic type. The study provides support for the hypothesis that the phonic types should be treated as sibling species. If songflight calls are used for mate choice, the differences may allow reproductive isolation between the two phonic types. The functions of songflight calls and social calls need to be investigated through experimental studies to explain the implications of the differences between phonic types.",

The North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat) aims to use its technology infrastructure to assess status and trends of bat populations, while developing innovative and community‐driven conservation solutions.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Here, we present\n                    NABat ML\n                    , an automated machine‐learning algorithm that improves the scalability and scientific transparency of NABat acoustic monitoring. This model combines signal processing techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and classify recorded bat echolocation calls. We developed our CNN model with internet‐based computing resources (‘cloud environment’), and trained it on >600,000 spectrogram images. We also incorporated species range maps to improve the robustness and accuracy of the model for future ‘unseen’ data. We evaluated model performance using a comprehensive, independent, holdout dataset.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    NABat ML\n                    successfully distinguished 31 classes (30 species and a noise class) with overall weighted‐average accuracy and precision rates of 92%, and ≥90% classification accuracy for 19 of the bat species. Using a single cloud‐environment computing instance, the entire model training process took <16 h.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Our convolutional neural network (CNN)‐based model,\n                    NABat ML\n                    , classifies 30 North American bat species using their recorded echolocation calls with an overall accuracy of 92%. In addition to providing highly accurate species‐level classification,\n                    NABat ML\n                    and its outputs are compatible with Bayesian and other statistical techniques for measuring uncertainty in classification. Our model is open‐source and reproducible, enabling future implementations as software on end‐user devices and cloud‐based web applications. These qualities make\n                    NABat ML\n                    highly suitable for applications ranging from grassroots community science initiatives to big‐data methods developed and implemented by researchers and professional practitioners. We believe the transparency and accessibility of\n                    NABat ML\n                    will encourage broad‐scale participation in bat monitoring, and enable development of innovative solutions needed to conserve North American bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Examining species boundaries using data from multiple independent sources is an appropriate and robust method to identify genetically isolated evolutionary units. We used 5 data sets—cytochrome b (Cytb), cytochrome c oxidase (COI), amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs), karyotypes, and morphology—to estimate phylogenetic relationships and species limits within woolly bats, genus Kerivoula, from Southeast Asia. We genetically analyzed 54 specimens of Kerivoula from Malaysia, assigned to 6 of the 10 species currently reported from the country. Phylogenetic analyses of nuclear AFLPs (33 specimens) and mitochondrial DNA sequences from Cytb (51 specimens) and COI (48 specimens) resulted in similar statistically supported species-level clades with minimal change in branching order. Using comparisons of cranial and dental morphology and original species descriptions, we assigned the resulting phylogenetic clades to K. hardwickii, K. intermedia, K. lenis, K. minuta, K. papillosa, K pellucida, and 1 unidentified species. Karyotypes further documented variability among the 6 clades. Five different karyotypes were identified, with 2 species having indistinguishable karyotypes. We compared our COI gene sequence data to 110 specimens of Kerivoula from Southeast Asia made available by researchers of the Barcode of Life Database. Our Cytb and AFLP species identifications were congruent with those in the COI database. Intraspecific geographic variation of about 5–7% sequence divergence was observed in Cytb and COI genes within both K. hardwickii and K. minuta. Relaxed molecular clock analyses indicated a late Oligocene to early Miocene origin of the Kerivoulinae with intraspecific diversification events coinciding with the late Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs in at least 6 species. Specimens from Sabah (northeastern Borneo) showed relatively high genetic divergence compared to those between Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak (southwestern Borneo), indicating Pleistocene or Pliocene refugia in Borneo. We conclude that at least 1 distinct lineage of Kerivoula is yet to be described from Borneo and that the intraspecific geographic variation in some species agrees with previous studies on the diversification of flora and fauna in Borneo.

The fungal disease was first observed in 2006 and has since caused the death of nearly six million bats. The disease, commonly known as white-nose syndrome, is characterized by a cutaneous infection with P. destructans causing erosions and ulcers in the skin of nose, ears and/or wings of bats. Previous studies based on sequences from eight loci have found that isolates of P. destructans from bats in the US all belong to one multilocus genotype. Using the same multilocus sequence typing method, we found that isolates from eastern and central Canada also had the same genotype as those from the US, consistent with the clonal expansion of P. destructans into Canada. However, our PCR fingerprinting revealed that among the 112 North American isolates we analyzed, three, all from Canada, showed minor genetic variation. Furthermore, we found significant variations among isolates in mycelial growth rate; the production of mycelial exudates; and pigment production and diffusion into agar media. These phenotypic differences were influenced by culture medium and incubation temperature, indicating significant variation in environmental condition--dependent phenotypic expression among isolates of the clonal P. destructans genotype in North America.",

            "abstractNote": "Behavioural plasticity is a critical component of natural selection leading to evolution. However, a surge of studies in the last two decades has discovered a distinct limit to behavioural plasticity, commonly referred to as behaviour types and behavioural syndromes. We set out to understand the relationships across behavioural categories in wild-caught adult, female big brown bats and how they compare between social and solitary behaviours. Using bats sampled from four different maternity colonies, we ran a series of behavioural assays to create a behavioural proﬁle for each individual. The behavioural proﬁle encompassed exploratory, learning, competitive and aggressive categories. We found that Big brown bats exhibit a mean proﬁle relatively unique to other well-documented species, where aggression was linked to increased competitive ability but not to boldness. Our results indicate that the solitary and socially directed behaviours of individuals are not necessarily related and that behaviours pertaining to social interactions are linked most closely to learning abilities. Furthermore, we found evidence that poor body condition may be a predictor of increased social interactions and that behaviours exhibited in the presence of conspeciﬁcs are unrelated to those exhibited in solitude. These ﬁndings indicate importance of social afﬁliations on individual behaviours in this species and their uniqueness relative to other well-studied taxa.",

Although preferential associations have been documented in multiple species, this phenomenon has never been empirically studied in bats—the second largest order of mammals, where many of the 1200+ species live in groups of tens to hundreds of individuals. Given the current understanding of the social behaviour exhibited in this species, we explored the possibility that adult female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus (Beauvois, 1796)) show preferential association between group-mates using a pairwise choice design with individuals from a captive colony. Focal individuals were placed in a Y-maze and were given free choice of two familiar conspeciﬁcs. We measured the time focal individuals spent in close proximity to each conspeciﬁc. Our results indicate that some bats exhibit preferential association between group-mates, as multiple individuals spent signiﬁcantly more time in close proximity to one conspeciﬁc versus another, despite randomizing the position of stimulus bats between trials. Given the frequent and long-term associations between group members of this species, social preferences could play a signiﬁcant role in the outcomes of their long-term ﬁtness.",

One case is still under treatment with pimobendan alone, following diagnosis before onset of clinical signs. Diuretic treatment consisted of furosemide at a dose rate of 0.5–5 mg/kg, one to three times daily, and, or spironolactone at a dose rate of 1–4 mg/kg, once or twice daily. When used, the ACEI imidapril was given at a dose rate of 0.24–0.38 mg/kg q 24 hr, and pimobendan at a dose rate of 0.2–0.5 mg/kg bid.

The circular mitogenome of M. bombinus is 17,035 bp long which is slightly shorter than that of the previous mitogenome of M. bombinus. It includes 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes, and 22 transfer RNAs. The base composition was AT-biased (66.1%). Fifty single nucleotide polymorphisms and 14 insertions were identified between two mitogenomes of M. bombinus. Phylogenetic trees show that both M. bominus mitogenomes are clustered in one clade.",

Further specimens of Chironax melanocephalus from Borneo confirm the allocation of this population to the nominate subspecies.

            "abstractNote": "We report records for eight species of tube-nosed bats, Murina, from Laos. Murina cyclotis is the most widespread in the region, although DNA barcodes of specimens currently identified as M. cyclotis suggest high genetic diversity within southeast Asia with the possibility that the form found in Indochina is not the same as that from the type locality on the Indian subcontinent. We recognize M. peninsularis from peninsular Malaysia and Borneo as distinct from M. cyclotis. Murina huttoni is known from only one locality in Laos but has been reported from scattered localities elsewhere in southeast Asia including Vietnam and Thailand. Specimens previously reported as M. tubinaris from southeast Asia, including Laos, were recently recognized as a distinct species, M. cineracea; however, we suggest M. feae is the appropriate name for this species, based on examination of the holotype from Myanmar. Specimens formerly reported as M. aurata from Laos are now referred to the recently described M. eleryi from Vietnam. A specimen from northern Laos matches the description of M. harrisoni in morphology, while genetically it matches M. tiensa. Comparisons with additional material from Vietnam, as well as DNA from both type specimens, suggest that M. tiensa is a junior synonym of M. harrisoni. We also report M. harrisoni from Thailand and Myanmar, based on specimens originally published as M. leucogaster. The latter species is not otherwise known to occur in Thailand or Myanmar and should be removed from those countries’ lists. The recently described M. walstoni is here reported for the first time from Laos. Two additional species from Laos do not match any currently described species, and are here described as new; both are also reported from Vietnam and one from Cambodia.",

We investigated flower-visiting behavior of pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus, Vespertilionidae) to bat-adapted flowers of cardon cacti (Pachycereus pringlei) to determine whether pallid bats consume floral nectar or visit flowers to opportunistically glean insects attracted to flowers. In 2007 and 2008, we recorded flower-visiting behavior of bats using infrared videography on 143 cactus-nights across 14 sites in Baja California, Mexico. Pallid bats were regular visitors to cardon flowers and consumed floral nectar by plunging their faces into the corolla to lap pooled nectar. We recorded 1,198 flower visits by A. pallidus, which accounted for 10% of visits to flowers by all bats. Pallid bats visited flowers on 57% of cactus-night observations (n 5 81/143) and 52% (n 5 28/54) of captured bats had visible pollen loads. Flower-visiting activity by A. pallidus was concentrated early in the evening where nectarivorous Mexican lesser long-nosed bats (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae [5 curasoae], Phyllostomidae) were present, but more evenly distributed throughout the night at sites without L. yerbabuenae, suggesting potential competitive exclusion among these nocturnal chiropteran pollinators.",

Using\n              Kendall & Nichols' (1995)\n              full‐likelihood approach of the robust design to account for temporary emigration, we tested whether survival and breeding propensity is influenced by regional weather patterns and timing of reproduction.\n            \n            \n              3.\n              Our results demonstrate that adult female survival of\n              M. lucifugus\n              ranged from 0·63 (95% CL = 0·56, 0·68) to 0·90 (95% CL = 0·77, 0·94), and was highest in wet years with high cumulative summer precipitation. First‐year survival [range: 0·23 (95% CL = 0·14, 0·35) to 0·46 (95% CL = 0·34, 0·57)] was considerably lower than adult survival and depended on pup date of birth, such that young born earlier in the summer (\n              c.\n              late May) had a significantly higher probability of surviving their first year than young born later in the summer (\n              c.\n              mid‐July). Similarly, the probability of young females returning to the maternity colony to breed in the summer following their birth year was higher for individuals born earlier in the summer [range: 0·23 (95% CL = 0·08, 0·50) to 0·53 (95% CL = 0·30, 0·75)].\n            \n            \n              4.\n              The positive influence of early parturition on 1st‐year survival and breeding propensity demonstrates significant fitness benefits to reproductive timing in this temperate insectivorous bat.\n            \n            \n              5.\n              Climatic factors can have important consequences for population dynamics of temperate bats, which may be negatively affected by summer drying patterns associated with global climate change.\n            \n            \n              6.\n              Understanding long‐term demographic trends will be important in the face of a novel disease phenomenon (White‐Nose Syndrome) that is associated with massive mortalities in hibernating bat species, including\n              M. lucifugus\n              , in the northeastern United States.",

The arboreal ecospace is particularly important in vertebrate evolution because it provides new food resources and protection from large ground-dwelling predators. We investigated the skeletal anatomy of the Late Permian (approx. 260 Ma) herbivorous synapsid\n              Suminia getmanovi\n              and performed a morphometric analysis of the phalangeal proportions of a great variety of extant and extinct terrestrial and arboreal tetrapods to discern locomotor function and habitat preference in fossil taxa, with special reference to\n              Suminia\n              . The postcranial anatomy of\n              Suminia\n              provides the earliest skeletal evidence for prehensile abilities and arboreality in vertebrates, as indicated by its elongate limbs, intrinsic phalangeal proportions, a divergent first digit and potentially prehensile tail. The morphometric analysis further suggests a differentiation between grasping and clinging morphotypes among arboreal vertebrates, the former displaying elongated proximal phalanges and the latter showing an elongation of the penultimate phalanges. The fossil assemblage that includes\n              Suminia\n              demonstrates that arboreality and resource partitioning occurred shortly after the initial establishment of the modern type of terrestrial vertebrate ecosystems, with a large number of primary consumers and few top predators.",

The flowering synchrony of trees has also been proposed as an additional factor in controlling fruit set and regulating levels of outcrossing, particularly in disturbed habitats. We examined the effects of forest fragmentation and flowering phenology on the reproductive success and genetic structure of the progeny produced by the tropical tree Pachira quinata. We conducted our study in the dry forest of Costa Rica and compared trees in two density and environmental conditions: (1) isolated trees separated by 500 m from other adult conspecifics and located in disturbed sites and (2) trees from continuous populations of groups of 20 or more reproductive individuals per hectare surrounded by undisturbed mature forest. Our study was conducted in the Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica, and surrounding areas. To evaluate flowering phenology, trees were classified as having synchronous or asynchronous flowering. The phenological stage of individuals was classified according to the proximity of the peak flowering date of each tree with respect to the mean peak flowering of the rest of the population. Six percent of the flowers produced a fruit in trees from continuous populations, whereas in isolated trees only 3% of the flowers did so. Fruit set was not affected by the flowering phenology of trees but was influenced mainly by factors associated with forest fragmentation. Seed production per fruit was not affected by forest fragmentation or flowering phenology. Overall, total fruit production per tree was not affected by forest fragmentation, because isolated trees tended to produce more flowers than trees from continuous populations. Genetic analysis revealed that the progeny of trees from continuous populations experienced lower levels of relatedness, a tendency for higher levels of outcrossing, and/ or more sires than isolated trees. Our results suggest that forest fragmentation can have an effect on the mating patterns of P. quinata, reducing the number of outcross sires represented in the progeny of isolated trees.",

Eight orders of insects were identified in the faeces. Lepidoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera had high frequencies of occurrence, but the proportion of each order varied with the sampling period. A comparison between diet composition and relative insect abundance showed that proportions of Coleoptera in the diet were larger than those in insect abundance. This pattern also was true for Lepidoptera in some sampling periods. In contrast, proportions of Diptera in the diet were lower than those in insect abundance, although Diptera was a major prey item. These results suggest that the diet composition of V. sinensis may be biased towards larger-sized taxa. Furthermore, the lack of any significant differences between diet composition and insect abundance for the other five orders suggested that the diet composition of V. sinensis is also influenced by the seasonal prevalence of each insect taxon.",

We conducted a preliminary study of a maternity colony of Murina ussuriensis in warm temperate rain forest of Yakushima, Japan. Day roosts of six nursing females were located by radio-telemetry. During the eight days of the study 18 maternity roost locations were confirmed. The nine roosts that were clearly visible included four types: vertically suspended clusters of dead leaves, tree hollows, a crevice in a root plate and a completely exposed site under a branch. Whenever the same female was located on successive days, she had switched from her previous roost, and none of the roosts was re-used by a radio-tagged female during the study period. The number of individuals recorded roosting together ranged from two (a mother with infant) to 22 individuals. The first emergence of an adult female occurred between 13 and 47 minutes after sunset. Mothers returned to the roost about 30 minutes after their first emergence, repeatedly hovering near the roost, landing and departing again. Some offspring left the roost independently, while non-volant offspring were carried away by an adult, presumably the mother. Various types of social calls were recorded, beginning when the first mother returned to the roost, and then almost continuously until the last individual left the roost. These preliminary results suggest that maternity colonies show very frequent roost-switching, may exhibit fission-fusion behaviour and have an extensive vocal repertoire.",

The M. lucifugus responded to 'distress' calls of conspecifics but not to other noises, specifically feeding sounds of Myotis spp., continuous 45 kHz sound, and 'distress' cries of Eptesicusfuscus. Responses to the 'distress' cries of conspecifics included general increases in levels of activity and low-frequency vocalizations (audible to us), and swooping flights near the ultrasonic loudspeaker from which the sounds eminated. When a dead M. lucifugus was suspended above the speaker and the 'distress' calls of this species were presented, bats circled close to the carcass; they did not respond in this way when other sounds were presented or during controls when the carcass was present.",

Little Brown Bats (Myotis lucifugus) are one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in Canada; however, little is known of their longevity. We captured bats in Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park, Saskatchewan in May 2015, as part of long-term bat research in the Park that began in 1991. On 31 May 2015, we captured 16 female Little Brown Bats in a maternity colony, including a bat that was originally captured and banded as an adult in 1993. This capture record indicates that the female bat was at least 23 y old and this record represents the oldest bat record in Saskatchewan. Little Brown Bats in eastern North America have declined dramatically due to white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease responsible for the quickest wildlife die-off in history. Pre-infection natural history data for Little Brown Bats are important as the disease spreads through central Canada.",

The taxonomic issues at the generic level of certain species of Hipposideros remain unresolved in part related to insufficient material in previous molecular studies. Herein, we expand sampling of the commersonii group and include H. commersonii sensu stricto from its type locality, Madagascar. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the commersonii group forms a highly supported monophyletic clade with H. cyclops, which is sister taxa to Aselliscus and Coelops. A combination of phylogenetic and comparative morphological analyses, as well as divergence time estimates, were used to provide compelling evidence to support the placement of the clade containing the commersonii group and that with H. cyclops in two resurrected genera, Macronycteris and Doryrhina, respectively. Divergence time estimates indicated that Macronycteris and Doryrhina diverged 19 mya and separated from Coelops and Aselliscus in the Oligocene, about 31 mya. The commersonii group underwent a rapid radiation as recently as 3 mya likely in response to favourable climatic conditions during the Late Pliocene in Africa. Phylogenetic analysis of Cyt-b could not resolve relationships within this morphologically conserved complex. Further sampling is necessary to fully elucidate the evolutionary history of Doryrhina.

The capacity to survive infections\n of highly pathogenic agents without severe disease, together with many other unique features, makes bats an ideal animal model for studying the regulation of infection, cancer, and longevity, which is likely to translate into human health outcomes. A key factor that limits bat research is\n lack of breeding bat colonies. To address this need, a captive bat colony was established in Singapore from 19 wild-caught local cave nectar bats. The bats were screened for specific pathogens before the start of captive breeding. Custom-made cages and an optimized diet inclusive of Wombaroo\n dietary formula, liquid diet, and supplement of fruits enabled the bats to breed prolifically in our facility. Cages are washed daily and disinfected once every fortnight. Bats are observed daily to detect any sick bat or abnormal behavior. In addition, bats undergo a thorough health check\n once every 3 to 4 mo to check on their overall wellbeing, perform sampling, and document any potential pregnancy. The current colony houses over 80 bats that are successfully breeding, providing a valuable resource for research in Singapore and overseas.",

Only limited knowledge on the susceptibility of the natural EBLV-hosts, insectivorous bats, to lyssavirus infection is available. Our study was undertaken to evaluate the susceptibility and pathology associated with an EBLV-1 infection in Eptesicus fuscus following different routes of virus inoculation including intracranial (n = 6), intramuscular (n = 14), oral (n = 7) and intranasal (n = 7). Blood and saliva samples were collected from all bats on a monthly basis. Four bats inoculated intracranially developed rabies with a mean of 11 days to death, whilst seven bats inoculated intramuscularly developed rabies, with an extended incubation period prior to death. We did not observe any mortality in the oral (p.o.) or intranasal (i.n.) groups and both groups had detectable levels of virus neutralizing antibodies (data not shown). Virus shedding was demonstrated in the saliva by virus isolation and the detection of viral RNA in ill bats, particularly immediately prior to the development of disease. In addition, the presence of virus and viral RNA was detected in the thyroid gland in bats challenged experimentally with EBLV-1, which exceeded that detected in all other extraneural tissue. The signiﬁcance of detecting EBLV-1 in the thyroid gland of rabid bats is not well understood. We speculate that the infection of the thyroid gland may cause subacute thyroiditis, a transient form of thyroiditis causing hyperthyroidism, resulting in changes in adrenocortical activity that could lead to hormonal dysfunction, thereby distinguishing the clinical presentation of rabies in the rabid host.",

Both species appear to occur sympatrically in several localities including Sulawesi, Borneo and peninsular Malaysia. Peninsular Malaysian specimens referred to M. ater are larger than those from elsewhere and are allied with ater with some doubt. M. ater nugax from Borneo appears to be the Bornean representative of M. ater, but specimens formerly referred to that form by Hill and Francis (1984) and Payne et al. (1985) prove to be a previously undescribed species which is described here. M. oreias from Singapore is quite distinct from any of these species, but the type and only known specimen is in poor condition, and its true affinities are difficult to determine.",

During the study, the bats fed mainly on frogs, selecting only\n              Ptychadena anchietae\n              ; they also took crickets, moths and cicadas. Each bat usually consumed two frogs each night and patterns of occupation of feeding perches suggest that their foraging efficiency was between 21 and 36%.

Aerial feeders have small hind feet, short calcars, short ears, and narrow tragi. Gleaners have small hind feet, long ears, and wide tragi and tend to be larger in body size. Bats that feed over water have large hind feet, short calcars, short ears, and narrow tragi and tend to be smaller in body size. Trawlers have large hind feet and long calcars and tend to be larger in body size. The morphometric analysis also confirmed that some species of Myotis were intermediate in morphological features, coinciding with alternation between foraging styles. The results support the view that the morphological features previously used to assign Myotis species to subgenera are more functional than phylogenetic, a position supported by recent genetic analyses. Examination of foraging styles from a phylogenetic perspective suggests that aerial feeding is ancestral and that subsequent diversification has been associated with partitioning and specialization into either gleaning or foraging over water and trawling. When the predictions from the multivariate analysis of the data for the genus Myotis are used with data from other bats, they suggest that 5 species of Nycteris are gleaners, while 11 species of Eptesicus are either aerial feeders or feed over water.",

Here, we used microsatellite-based estimates of relatedness and records of 157 individually marked adults from 106 roost captures over 6 years, to infer whether male and female\n              T. cirrhosus\n              have preferred co-roosting associations and whether such associations were influenced by relatedness. Using a null model that controlled for year and roosting location, we found that both male and female\n              T. cirrhosus\n              have preferred roosting partners, but that only females demonstrate kin-biased association. Most roosting groups (67%) contained multiple females with one or two reproductive males. Relatedness patterns and recapture records corroborate genetic evidence for female philopatry and male dispersal. Our study adds to growing evidence that many bats demonstrate preferred roosting associations, which has the potential to influence social information transfer.",

Both species produced echolocation calls during attacks on prey, increasing the rates of pulse repetition as they closed with targets and suggesting the use of echolocation in hunting.

Multiple analyses of call features, including duration (ms), lowest frequency (kHz), highest frequency (kHz) and frequency with most energy (kHz), indicated signiﬁcant inter-individual variation. Discriminant function analysis of call features correctly classiﬁed the calls of individuals from four roosts > 70% on 19 of 28 times. Although other species of molossids (Chaerephon pumilus, Tadarida aegyptiaca, and one unidentiﬁed species) produced social calls as well as frequency-modulated sweep calls, O. martiensseni produced just the latter vocalizations and they were longer and lower in frequency than those of the sympatric molossids. Other species of molossids, but not O. martiensseni, produced feeding buzzes as they attacked ﬂying insects. The frequency-modulated sweep calls of O. martiensseni seem to serve a communication function, but they may not be used in echolocation unlike similar calls by other molossids. Individually distinct communication signals (frequency-modulated sweep calls) enhance communication in a species that lives in year-round social groups (one adult male, females and dependent young).",

            "abstractNote": "Phylogeographical studies are typically based on haplotype data, occasionally on nuclear markers such as microsatellites, but rarely combine both. This is unfortunate because the use of markers with contrasting modes of inheritance and rates of evolution might provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of a species’ history. Here we present a detailed study of the phylogeography of the greater horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, using 1098 bp of the mitochondrial ND2 gene from 45 localities from across its Palaearctic range to infer population history. In addition, we re-analysed a large microsatellite data set available for this species and compared the results of both markers to infer population relationships and the historical processes influencing them. We show that mtDNA, the most popular marker in phylogeography studies, yielded a misleading result, and would have led us to conclude erroneously that a single expansion had taken place in Europe. Only by combining the mitochondrial and microsatellite data sets are we able to reconstruct the species’ history and show two colonization events in Europe, one before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and one after it. Combining markers also revealed the importance of Asia Minor as an ancient refugium for this species and a source population for the expansion of the greater horseshoe bat into Europe before the LGM.",

Despite the fact that many bats are also long-distant migrants, the importance of foraging habitats for sustaining migrant bats has to date received little attention. We analyzed habitat selection patterns in the migrant bat, Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii, in the southernmost part of its range (Iberian Peninsula), an area in which both mating and hibernation occur. We found that natural wetlands and riparian habitats (Phragmites reed beds) were positively selected, whereas human-transformed aquatic habitats (rice paddies) were avoided. Although semi-natural human-managed wetlands are perceived as being valuable for many species, our data emphasizes the importance of preserving natural wetlands (including riparian forests) as appropriate habitats for sustaining crucial phases of the life cycle of this bat. Agricultural transformation of the land is likely to be detrimental to this species since it reduces the availability of its preferred foraging habitat.",

Here we show that riboflavin overproduction by a fungal pathogen and its hyperaccumulation in affected host tissue exacerbates a skin infection to necrosis. In white-nose syndrome (WNS) skin lesions caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans, maximum riboflavin concentrations reached up to 815 μg ml−1, indicating bioaccumulation and lack of excretion. We found that high riboflavin concentrations are cytotoxic under conditions specific for hibernation, affect bats’ primary fibroblasts and induce cell detachment, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, polymerization of cortical actin, and cell necrosis. Our results explain molecular pathology of WNS, where a skin infection becomes fatal. Hyperaccumulation of vitamin B2 coupled with reduced metabolism and low tissue oxygen saturation during hibernation prevents removal of excess riboflavin in infected bats. Upon reperfusion, oxygen reacts with riboflavin resulting in dramatic pathology after arousal. While multiple molecules enable invasive infection, riboflavin-associated extensive necrosis likely contributes to pathophysiology and altered arousal pattern in infected bats. Bioaccumulation of a vitamin under natural infection represents a novel condition in a complex host-pathogen interplay.",

Average prey diversity differed two- to threefold between sites. Dietary composition showed large spatial variations between sites, from predominantly insectivorous to avian. Between-island variation was assessed by comparing the dietary composition of populations of Barn Owls on nine islands throughout the Caribbean region as reported in the literature. On 8/9 islands mammals (mainly rodents and bats) formed the main diet. On half of the islands about a fifth or more of the prey comprised birds. Reptiles and/or insects were eaten on 5/9 islands, but rarely dominated the diet. These large within-island dietary differences reflect differential prey availabilities in the Caribbean, possibly enhanced locally by specialisation.",

Here we present the complete mitogenome and place our results in a phylogenetic context with other data generated for the family Phyllostomidae. The circular genome had 16,717 bp in size, comprising 37 genes and GC content of 42.24%. Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree indicated a well-supported relationship between the representatives of Tonatia into the subfamily Phyllostominae.",

We recorded auditory receptor cell action potentials elicited in underwing moths (Catocala spp.) by echolocation calls emitted during gleaning attacks by Myotis septentrionalis (the northern long-eared bat) and during ﬂights by the aerial hawker Myotis lucifugus (the little brown bat). The moth ear responds inconsistently and with fewer action potentials to the echolocation calls emitted by the gleaner, a situation that worsened when the moth’s ear was covered by its wing (mimicking a moth resting on a surface). Calls emitted by the aerial-hawking bat elicited a signiﬁcantly stronger spiking response from the moth ear. Moths with their ears covered by their wings maintained their relative hearing sensitivity at their best frequency range, the range used by most aerial insectivorous bats, but showed a pronounced deafness in the frequency range typically employed by gleaning bats. Our results (1) support the prediction that the echolocation calls of gleaners are acoustically inconspicuous to the ears of moths (and presumably other nocturnal tympanate insects), leaving the moths particularly vulnerable to predation, and (2) suggest that gleaners gain a foraging advantage against eared prey.",

            "abstractNote": "Echolocating bats are exposed not only to the echoes of their own calls, but often the signals of conspecifics and other bats. For species emitting short, frequency modulated signals (e.g. vespertilionoids), adjustments in both the frequency and time domain have been observed in such situations. However, bats using long duration, constant frequency calls may confront special challenges, since these bats should be less able to avoid temporal and frequency overlap. Here we investigated echolocation call design in the high-duty cycle bat, Rhinolophus capensis, as bats flew with either a conspecific or heterospecific in a large outdoor flight-room. We compared these recordings to those made of bats flying alone in the same flight-room, and in a smaller flight room, alone, and hunting tethered moths. We found no differences in duty cycle or peak frequency of the calls of R. capensis across conditions. However, in the presence of a conspecific or the vespertilionoid, Miniopterus natalensis, R. capensis produced longer frequency-modulated downward sweeps at the terminus of their calls with lower minimum frequencies than when flying alone. In the presence of the larger high-duty cycle bat, R. clivosus, R. capensis produced shorter calls than when flying alone or with a conspecific. These changes are similar to those of vespertilionoids when flying from open to more cluttered environments. They are not similar to those differences observed in vespertilionoids when flying with other bats. Also unlike vespertilinoids, R. capensis used calls 15 dB less intense in conspecific pairs than when alone.",

Prior to the discovery of the bats in 1987, the house was broken into regularly and disturbance levels were quite high. Upon discovery of the roost, the house was fortified and vandalism was greatly reduced. The number of females and the number of volant young greatly increased during our study and was directly correlated with the decline in vandalism. Bats emerged from the house 43.6 (± 10.9 SD) min after local sunset. Bats emerged later in the evening during spring and fall, when it was warmer, and when it was windier. We also evaluated duration of emergence (47.11 [45.0–49.7] min), and seasonal patterns of re-entry into the roost. Several factors suggested that potential predation, most likely by owls, influenced both the timing and duration of evening emergences.",

However, little is known concerning how intrinsic and extrinsic factors affect animal daily rhythms in the field, especially in nocturnal animals. Here, we investigated the first emergence, mid-­emergence, and return times of Vespertilio sinensis, and also integrated environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and light intensity) and biotic factors (reproductive status and predation risk) to determine causes of variation in the activity rhythms of the bats. We found that variation in the first emergence time, the mid-­emergence time, and the final return time were distinct. The results demonstrated that the emergence and return times of bats were affected by light intensity, reproductive status, and predation risk in a relatively complex pattern. Light intensity had the greatest contribution to activity rhythms. Moreover, we first investigated the effects of actual predators on the activity rhythms of bats; the results showed that the mid-­emergence time of bats was earlier as predators were hunting, but the final return time was later when predators were present. Finally, our results also highlighted the importance of higher energy demands during the lactation in bats to variation in activity rhythms. These results improve our understanding of the patterns and causes of variation in activity rhythms in bats and other nocturnal animals.",

In this study, we investigated seasonal variations in body mass, diameter and height of seminiferous tubules and nuclei of Leydig cells in a population of southeastern Brazil. We also determined the frequencies of the stages of the seminiferous epithelium cycle (SEC) of mature individuals of this population. Body mass and diameter of Leydig cell nuclei showed no signiﬁcant differences between dry and rainy seasons and stages of annual reproductive cycle; however, all other morphometric parameters varied signiﬁcantly. The relative cumulative frequency of pre-meiotic stages of the SEC (1–3) was 51%, of meiotic stage (4) was 2% and of post-meiotic stages (5–8) was 47%. We conﬁrmed that the yellowish myotis presents seasonal sperm production as revealed by testis regression and epididymal sperm storage during the dry season.",

The colony was monitored each month from November 2014 to December 2015 with 154 males and 117 females captured. Testicular and ovarian histological data from 31 adult males and 22 adult females were obtained. Body condition index of male and female, and gonadosomatic index, epididymis-somatic index and Sertoli cell efficiency were analyzed. Females with spermatozoa in uterine crypts, embryos in oviducts, gravid uteri, and pregnant females were registered during the rainy season (November–March) and into the beginning of the following dry season (April), indicating asynchrony of births. The ovaries showed all types of ovarian follicles, and a polarized ovary cortex was found, differing from the organization pattern of most mammals. The testes showed continuous spermatic activity, but testicular parameters analyzed showed significantly higher values during the rainy season. A shorter mating period during the beginning of this season was detected, when values of the gonadosomatic and epididymis-somatic indexes, and Sertoli cell efficiency showed more pronounced differences in relation to the remaining period of study. Unlike polyestry known for some Neotropical phyllostomids, the reproductive cycle of A. geoffroyi was characterized as seasonal monoestrous, with the main reproductive events occurring during the rainy season, as the best time for females to reproduce, but with offspring recruitment occurring predominantly during the dry season, a period with fewer food resources.",

Males of some species may change tactics depending on age, body condition and social environment. Many bat species are polygynous where a fraction of males only have access to fertile females. For polygynous bats, knowledge of the reproductive success of males using different ARTs is scarce, and it remains unclear how age of males is related to switching decisions between social statuses. We studied a large captive population of Carollia perspicillata, where males are either harem holders, bachelors or peripheral males. Using a multistate procedure, we modelled the age-related switches in reproductive tactics and in survival probability. From the model, we calculated the reproductive success and the frequencies of males displaying different reproductive tactics. As in mammals, the switch between social statuses is often related to age, we predicted that the transition probability of bachelor and peripheral males to harem status would increase with age. We show, however, that social status transition towards a harem holding position was not related to age. Reproductive success changed with age and social status. Harem males had a signiﬁcantly higher reproductive success than bachelor males except between a short period from 3.8 to 4.4 years of age where success was similar, and a signiﬁcantly higher reproductive success than peripheral males between 2.6 and 4.4 years of age. Harem males showed a clear decrease in the probability of maintaining social status with age, which suggests that senescence reduces resource holding potential.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats of the genus Sturnira (Family Phyllostomidae) are characterised by shoulder glands that are more developed in reproductively mature adult males. The glands produce a waxy secretion that accumulates on the fur around the gland, dyeing the fur a dark colour and giving off a pungent odour. These shoulder glands are thought to play a role in their reproductive behaviour. Using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, we analysed solvent extracts of fur surrounding the shoulder gland in the northern-shouldered bat, Sturnira parvidens to (i) characterise the chemical composition of shoulder gland secretions for the ﬁrst time, and (ii) look for differences in chemical composition among and between adult males, sub-adult/juvenile males and adult females. Fur solvent extracts were analysed as liquids and also further extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction to identify volatile components in the odour itself. Odour ﬁngerprint analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling plots and multivariate analysis revealed clear and signiﬁcant differences (P < 0.001) between adult males vs both juvenile males and adult females. The chemical components of the shoulder gland secretion included terpenes and phenolics, together with alcohols and esters, most likely derived from the frugivorous diet of the bat. Many of the compounds identiﬁed were found exclusively or in elevated quantities among adult (reproductive) males compared with adult females and non-reproductive (juvenile) males. This strongly suggests a speciﬁc role in male–female attraction although a function in male–male competition and/or species recognition is also possible.",

Current lack of knowledge about the roosting ecology of these species in boreal forest limits our understanding of how they may be affected by logging. The main objective was to identify tree and forest stand features that were selected by bats for roosting within a balsam ﬁr (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) – paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall) forest of Quebec, Canada. Over 3 years, we captured and ﬁtted radio transmitters to 22 individual bats to locate their roost trees for 7–14 days following release. We measured tree and forest stand features in the ﬁeld and using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology. Roost trees were compared with random trees using generalized linear mixed models. Male Myotis bats selected larger and taller snags, within stands containing a higher proportion of canopy gaps and a larger number of snags compared with random trees. Vegetation clumps of 0.1 ha containing a minimum of 10 snags with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 10 cm should be maintained to preserve roosting habitat that is used by male Myotis bats in balsam ﬁr – paper birch forests.",

This species is not federally protected, but receives legal protection in many states, including Tennessee. Additional information on the species, particularly its summer roosting ecology, is needed to inform appropriate management and conservation planning. While conducting a summer survey of multiple bat species using buildings as roosts in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, we discovered Eastern Small-footed Myotis roosting in 3 historic buildings on the northwest slope of Mount LeConte. At least 1 building contained a maternity colony. Humans used all 3 buildings on a daily basis.",

            "abstractNote": "We report on the results of a bat survey of the Pic de Fon, Simandou Range, southeastern Guinea. This bat survey was part of a larger Rapid Assessment Program (RAP) study conducted by Conservation International in an area currently explored for iron-ore mining by an international company. We document a speciose bat assemblage characterised by forest species, including bats such as Epomops buettikoferi, Rhinolophus guineensis and Hipposideros jonesi that are endemic to Upper Guinea or West Africa. The sympatric occurence of three species of Kerivoula is noteworthy, with K. phalaena representing the first record for Guinea. Moreover, three individuals of Welwitsch’s mouse-eared bat, Myotis welwitschii, were captured during the survey. This is the first record for West Africa and represents a range extension of minimally 3,400 km to the northwest from the nearest known localities. We review the distribution of this species in Africa and conclude that the species shows a paramontane distribution pattern (sensu Koopman, 1983). We also report M. welwitschii for the first time from Burundi. Our results of the RAP survey as well as the occurrence of bat species that are endemic to the Upper Guinea Highlands highlight the outstanding regional importance of the montane habitats of West Africa in general, and of the Simandou Range in particular for the conservation of bats in Africa.",

These species is included in the IUCN Red List list with Least Concern (LC) status or at the least information. This study was to describe of R. microphyllum as a new record in the southern of Lombok, and to examine the parasites and microbes that infest it. The study was carried out in the developed ecotourism area of southern Lombok Island of NTB during February-April 2017. A modified net and quadrant for cave ceiling was used to collect bat sample. Ectoparasite collection was done by combing the bat's hair and the falling specimens were collected. The endoparasite examination was done by the flotation methods of intestinal contents, while microbial examination was done by collecting the microbes from oral cavity and feces. The results showed the discovery of R. microphyllum in two ecotourism development sites, The Buwun Cave and The Gale Gale Bangkang Cave Prabu Village, Central Lombok. The endoparasit examination found 4 species of endoparasit, 1 species of Coccidia sp, 2 species of Trematodes from Lecithodendridae Family (Prosthodendrium sp and Acanthatrium sp) and 1 unidentified Nematode specimen. The ectoparasite examination found only 1 species, Ischnopsyllus hexactenus (The long Eared Bat Flea), and the microbes found from oral cavity analysis are the Gram positive Coccus (Stphylococcus aureus) and faecal analysis are the Coccobacil Gram negative (Providensia penneri).",

            "abstractNote": "Body mass changes of adult and juvenile male Daubenton’s bats were studied in a summer habitat in Hesse (Germany) in the years 1998-2001. Animals from the resident population were regularly captured along the flight path from April to October, and body mass was determined using a digital balance. Body mass of adult individuals differed significantly among fortnightly periods (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA by ranks: H = 141.75, p < 0.001). Body mass increased significantly from the second half of April (median: 7.0 g) to the first half of May (median: 7.8 g). Between the second half of May and the first half of August, median body mass fluctuated between 7.8 g and 8.3 g. From the second half of July (median: 7.9 g) to the second half of August (median: 8.4 g), and the second half of September (median: 9.3 g) body mass again significantly increased. The highest median body mass (9.6 g) was recorded in the second half of October. Median body mass of juvenile males ranged between 6.5 g in the first half of July and 8.5 g in the second half of October. Differences in body mass over the studied period were significant (H = 21.70, p < 0.01). During the months July, August, and September, body mass of adult males was significantly higher than that of juveniles, whereas in October the difference was no longer of statistical significance. It is suggested that the decrease in body mass observed in some adult males in September was related to their reproductive activity.",

Neighbor-joining analysis was performed and divergence time was calculated in combination with available online data on D-loop and ND2 sequences of M. fuliginosus in East Asia, respectively. Results suggest that M. fuliginosus populations living on Jeju Island and in Japan originated from China in the past 20,000 years.",

Roosts were situated in primary forest, secondary forest (overgrown clove plantations), traditional graveyards and mangrove areas. A range of sizes and species of trees were used as roosts. The minimum population of\n              P. voeltzkowi\n              was estimated to be between 4600 and 5500 individuals. In total 94 per cent of the population was located at 10 roost sites. Larger colonies were associated with roosts located in forests, which together supported 75 per cent of the total bat population. Colonies were of mixed sex, but no young or obviously pregnant females were observed. Major threats to this species appeared to be hunting and deforestation (both logging and clearing for agriculture) and\n              P. voeltzkowi\n              is considered to be endangered\n              .",

We combined this with data from hunter license sales and population projection models to assess the impact and sustainability of current hunting practices in Peninsular Malaysia.\n            \n            \n              3.\n              We monitored 33 active\n              Pteropus vampyrus\n              roost sites in Peninsular Malaysia, including eight seasonal roost sites. Roost site occupancy showed considerable temporal variation over the 3‐year study period.\n            \n            \n              4.\n              Hunting activity has more than doubled since 1996, and based on license sales, we estimate that a minimum legal harvest of 87 800 bats occurred between 2002 and 2005. Population models suggest that this level of hunting is likely to be unsustainable given our baseline abundance scenarios of 100 000, 250 000 or 500 000 bats, especially considering that these models do not include culling of Malayan flying foxes as agricultural pests or illegal hunting activities, for which there are no available data.\n            \n            \n              5.\n              Satellite telemetry of seven adult male bats show that Malayan flying foxes are highly mobile, travelling hundreds of kilometres between roosting sites within a year and occupying home ranges that extend beyond Malaysia to include Indonesia and Thailand. We conclude that focal hunting pressure in Malaysia threatens a regional population of this migratory mammal.\n            \n            \n              6.\n              Synthesis and applications.\n              This is the first study of its kind on flying foxes in Asia, and illustrates that bats, like other migratory species, urgently require comprehensive protection by regional management plans across their range.\n              P. vampyrus\n              moves across international borders in Southeast Asia. Current hunting practices within Malaysia together with limited protection in other countries may threaten its long‐term survival.",

            "abstractNote": "The greater noctule (Nyctalus lasiopterus) is one of the rarest, least studied and the largest European bat. It feeds on large flying insects and also preys extensively on small night-migrating songbirds that it presumably intercepts at high altitude. The present study provides the first systematic account of echolocation behaviour and call design in the greater noctule. We documented variability in call duration from 1.4 to 25 ms and an associated strong variation in frequency parameters of echolocation calls. Greater noctules adapted call structure and repetition rate to the current perceptual task. In open space, they used calls with very low peak and terminal frequencies; generally below 15 kHz. We recorded echolocation calls from the sympatric — at least in Eastern Europe —smaller congener N. noctula. Our data suggest that acoustic separation of the two species is feasible. Therefore, acoustic monitoring could prove useful to survey distribution and habitat use of the enigmatic greater noctule. Using still lower call frequency than N. lasiopterus would yield larger detection ranges for large echolocation targets such as migratory birds for the greater noctule, while it might be constrained by the upper hearing threshold of passerines and thus the predator’s potential conspicuousness to its prey. However, in a within-genus comparison, allometric scaling explained the greater noctules’ call frequency to a very large extent, i.e., we found no evidence for specific adaptations of call frequency to bird hunting.",

This behavior can be of public health concern where bats that may carry diseases (e.g., rabies) move among buildings occupied by people. We used passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) to mark individual bats and hoop PIT readers at emergence points to passively monitor the use of building roosts by marked adult females on a daily basis during the lactation phase of reproduction. Multi-strata models were used to examine movements among roosts in relation to ambient temperatures and ectoparasite loads. Our results suggest that high ambient temperatures inﬂuence movements. Numbers of mites (Steatonyssus occidentalis) did not appear to inﬂuence movements of female bats among building roosts. In an urban landscape, periods with unusually hot conditions are accompanied by shifting of bats to different buildings or segments of buildings, and this behavior may increase the potential for contact with people in settings where, in comparison to their more regularly used buildings, the bats may be more likely to be of public concern as nuisances or health risks.",

At birth young were altricial. By day five, their eyes had opened, and the pinnae become unfolded between sixth and ninth day of age. At the age of three days, the mean forearm length and body mass were equivalent to 42.2% and 18.2%, respectively of the values of postpartum females. The length of forearm increased linearly until 36 days and attained 94.1% of mean forearm length of postpartum females at the age of 219 days. Body mass of pups increased linearly until 60 days and attained 72.7% of mean mass of postpartum females at the age of 219 days. The length of total epiphyseal gap of fourth metacarpal-phalangeal joint increased until 15 days of age and subsequently decreased linearly, and closed at about 60 days of age. The age predicting equation based on the length of forearm is valid when its dimensions are between 29.4 mm and 52.4 mm (3–36 days of age). Similar equation but based on the length of total epiphyseal gap is valid when its dimensions range from 47.0 μm to 6.0 μm (15–60 days of age). Growth patterns of forearm length and body mass were best described by the logistic and Gompertz nonlinear growth models, respectively. There was no significant difference in the growth patterns of body mass and length of total epiphyseal gap with reference to lengths of forearm of captive and wild-grown pups.",

            "abstractNote": "The emergence of the disease chytridiomycosis caused by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been implicated in dramatic global amphibian declines. While many species have undergone catastrophic declines and/or extinctions, others appear to be unaffected or persist at reduced frequencies after Bd outbreaks. The reasons behind this variance in disease outcomes are poorly understood: differences in host immune responses have been proposed, yet previous studies suggest a lack of robust immune responses to Bd in susceptible species. Here, we sequenced transcriptomes from clutch-mates of a highly susceptible amphibian, Atelopus zeteki, with different infection histories. We found significant changes in expression of numerous genes involved in innate and inflammatory responses in infected frogs, despite high susceptibility to chytridiomycosis. We show evidence of acquired immune responses generated against Bd, including increased expression of immunoglobulins and MHC genes. In addition, fungal-killing genes had significantly higher expression in frogs previously exposed to Bd compared to Bd-naïve frogs, including chitinase and serine-type proteases. However, our results appear to confirm recent in vitro evidence of immune suppression by Bd, demonstrated by decreased expression of lymphocyte genes in the spleen of infected compared to control frogs. We propose susceptibility to chytridiomycosis is not due to lack of Bd-specific immune responses, but instead is caused by failure of those responses to be effective. Ineffective immune pathway activation and timing of antibody production are discussed as potential mechanisms. However, in light of our findings, suppression of key immune responses by Bd is likely an important factor in the lethality of this fungus.",

We studied whether the location of and landscape structure around nine nursery roosts and seven male-only roosts differed during the nursery period (15 May-31 July). Roosts were located by radio-tracking, and animal numbers and group composition were obtained by trapping and counting at roosts. Landscape structure was evaluated by a GIS-based habitat analysis. 2. Marked variation in animal numbers was observed both in nursery roosts (range: 6–144 individuals) and male roosts (range: 1–51 individuals). The surroundings of nursery and male roosts varied signiﬁcantly in the proportion of areas belonging to different landscape elements. The areas covered by ponds, lakes and rivers, as well as the area covered by coppices were larger in the surroundings of nursery roosts. Moreover, nursery roosts lay closer to a river and at lower altitudes than male roosts. Male Daubenton’s bats used more distant foraging sites than gravid or lactating females. 3. The differences in roost-site location between the two sexes are suggestive of intraspeciﬁc competition for access to productive foraging areas in the surroundings of the summer roosts, with females being dominant over males. We assume that breeding females defend climatically favourable areas with good food supply in order to increase the survival of their offspring.",

This is the first study to present a comprehensive data set that includes male M. daubentonii over the entire seasonal activity period. In males, parasite load increased during spermatogenesis, which can be explained by high testosterone levels acting as an immunosuppressant. Prevalence rates and infestation levels in males were always lower than those of females and juveniles, possibly due to grooming behaviour which may be energetically restricted in females and inefficient in juveniles. Colony size did not appear to influence parasite load in males, but was found to have an influence in females and juveniles. Larger group sizes in males might not increase parasite load since grooming behaviour and roost switching are frequent. This study showed that parasite load in free-ranging Daubenton’s bats is sex-, season- and age-specific due to variations in behaviour and physiology.",

In 2015, first pup was born on 20 May and by 10 days 85% of neonates were born. In the wet year, first pup was born on 26 May and by 10 days 56% of neonates were born. Synchrony of birth as defined by the clustering of births assessed by circular statistics showed that the angular variance in 2015 (S2 = 0.003) was significantly (p < .05) lower than in 2016 (S2 = 0.006). Multiple regression and generalized estimating equation indicate that the initial (y-intercepts) forearm length and body mass were not significantly (p > .05) different between the 2 years, but the tests for parallelism shows a significant decrease in growth rates of body mass and forearm length in the wet year (p < .05). In 2016, juvenile bats began their first foraging flights at 24–28 days of age with higher but nonsignificant (p > .05) wing loading (7.71 ± 0.48 N/m2) compared with 2015 (7.65 ± 0.57 N/m2). Similarly, aspect ratio of 1-day old neonates and juvenile bats in 2015 and 2016 did not show any significant difference (p > .05). Results of the present study suggest that R. ferrumequinum responded to prolonged precipitations and lower temperatures by delaying parturition, reducing birth synchrony and lowering postnatal growths.",
