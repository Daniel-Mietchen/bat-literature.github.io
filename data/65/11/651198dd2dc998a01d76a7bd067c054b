While a plant’s primary pollinator should strongly inﬂuence ﬂoral phenotype, selective pressures may also be exerted by other ﬂower visitors or competition with other plants for pollination. Species of the primarily bat-pollinated genus Burmeistera (Campanulaceae) frequently cooccur, with up to four species in a given site, and broadly overlap in ﬂowering phenology, typically ﬂowering throughout the year. The genus displays extensive interspeciﬁc variation in ﬂoral morphology in the degree that the reproductive parts (anthers and stigma) are exserted outside of the corolla, and species can be roughly classiﬁed as either long or short-exserted. I tested two hypotheses regarding the functional signiﬁcance of such variation: (1) exsertion lengths correspond to pollination by bat species of different sizes; and (2) variation serves to partition pollinator’s bodies spatially and thus reduces interspeciﬁc pollen transfer. I captured bats in Ecuador to evaluate the identity and location of the Burmeistera pollen they were carrying. Results show that exsertion does not correspond to specialization on different pollinators; different bat species carried pollen of both ﬂower types just as frequently. In support of the second hypothesis, pollen from ﬂowers of different exsertion lengths was found to occur on different regions of bats’ heads. This may serve to reduce competition for pollination among coexisting Burmeistera.",

            "abstractNote": "Coexisting plants that share pollinators can compete through interspecific pollen transfer. A long-standing idea holds that divergence in floral morphology may reduce this competition by placing pollen on different regions of the pollinator's bodies. However, surprisingly little empirical support for this idea exists.\n              Burmeistera\n              is a diverse neotropical genus that exhibits wide interspecific variation in the degree to which the reproductive parts are exserted outside the corolla. Coexisting\n              Burmeistera\n              share bats as their primary pollinators, and the degree of exsertion determines the site of pollen deposition on the bats' heads. Here we study the mechanism, process and pattern of floral character displacement for assemblages of coexisting\n              Burmeistera\n              . Flight cage experiments with bats and pairs of\n              Burmeistera\n              species demonstrate that the greater the divergence in exsertion length, the less pollen transferred interspecifically. Null model analyses of exsertion lengths for 19 species of\n              Burmeistera\n              across 18 sites (each containing two to four species) demonstrate that observed assemblage structure is significantly overdispersed relative to what would be expected by chance. Local evolution, rather than ecological sorting, appears to be the primary process driving this pattern of overdispersion because local adaptation of the nine widespread species accounts for a large portion of the observed pattern. Taken together, results of this study provide strong support for the idea that competition through interspecific pollen transfer can drive character displacement in plants.",

The big brown bat (\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              ) widely spans mainland landmasses from Canada to Ecuador and Colombia, and the insular Caribbean through The Bahamas and Greater and Lesser Antilles. Given the distribution of\n              E. fuscus\n              , we hypothesized that insular lineages could represent a different species aided by isolation. We assessed species limits by capitalizing on available mitochondrial and genomic data. Novel morphological and spatial datasets were produced to examine limits phenotypically and whether ecological niches could be associated with differences between groups. Phylogenetics strongly supported the Caribbean as unique compared to the mainland. Genomic data indicated high levels of genetic structure within the Caribbean and no detectable admixture of the Caribbean with continental lineages. Similarly, the Caribbean group shows high phenotypic disparity, and niche models revealed differences in habitat suitability between groups, concordant with the phylogenetic results. This study uncovered signals of divergence supporting the Caribbean clade of\n              E. fuscus\n              as unique through an integrative framework. We endorse re-evaluating the taxonomic status of Caribbean big brown bats as\n              Eptesicus dutertreus\n              . This recognition can help promote local conservation plans for insular lineages of big brown bats.",

Opportunities to evaluate the dynamics of the collapse of a sub-population on a vertebrate population in the wild are rare, requiring a crash during a long-term study of marked individuals. Endangered long-tailed bats Chalinolobus tuberculatus, which are members of the widespread family Vespertilionidae, live in closed social groups as evidenced by non-random associations of individuals and a low degree of mixing among colonies. During a 19-year mark-recapture study of long-tailed bats in the Eglinton Valley, New Zealand, one colony of bats collapsed over a 2-year period in which numbers of introduced predators were high. We investigated individual- and colony-level implications of this local extinction event. Survivors (11 known) were assimilated into the neighbouring colony during and immediately after the collapse, but retained higher association rates with individuals from their former colony. The neighbouring colony gradually extended its roosting range into habitat formerly occupied by the extinct colony. Acceptance of individuals into other colonies demonstrates resilience of highly structured vertebrate populations to local crashes.",

Here, we evaluate this possibility by sequencing the complete mitochondrial genome of four silver-haired bats from eastern and western populations. The three usable mitogenomes were closely associated with other Vespertilionid bats and the phylogenetic tree revealed the two western individuals grouping together to form their own clade. Our results support the idea of small but significant genetic differences between eastern and western populations of these bats, but this should be tested further.",

Most shape changes and structure development were observed at subadults and adults; zygomatic arch, sagittal crest, occipital process and mandibular processes developed noticeably up to the adult stage. Cranial sutures closure and fusion sequences of N. leporinus agree with that of hystricomorph rodents, artiodactyls, primates, sirenians and carnivores, beginning with the cranial vault followed by the basicranium, supporting a conserved pattern for mammalia. Detailed comparisons exhibit a complete cranial sutures fusion reached earlier at Desmodus rotundus regarding N. leporinus and Pteropus sp., and an early fusion for the sutura coronalis plus late fusion for the sutura sagittalis at N. leporinus regarding Desmodus rotundus. The drastic shape changes of cranial elements, as well as sutures closure and fusion in N. leporinus at subadults and adults, seem to be closely related to the acquisition of morphological specializations during stages of development when the fisher bat begins to feed independently.",

Here, we describe a new species based on specimens collected in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina, in the Pampa ecoregion. The new species can be distinguished from its congeners by its general strong orange coloration, forearm length &gt; 41 mm, dorsal hairs bicolor and long (~5 mm), infraorbital foramen laterally oriented, and long and forward-projected (pincer-like) upper incisors. The external and cranial morphology of the new species are described and comparisons made with other species of similar size and with those present in its distributional area. Wilcoxon tests and multivariate analyses (nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordination and PERMANOVA) were carried out to determine the morphometric differences between the new species and other seven species of Molossus. The species tree, estimated by *BEAST from the concatenation of mitochondrial and nuclear genes, suggests that Molossus sp. nov. is basal within the clade formed by {{M. aztecus, M. rufus}, {{M. currentium, M. pretiosus}, M. sinaloae}} with a posterior probability of 0.82.",

            "abstractNote": "The measurement of fitness in wild populations is a challenging task, and a number of proxies have been proposed with different degrees of success. Developmental instability/stability (DI) is an organismal property associated with variance in bilateral asymmetry (fluctuating asymmetry—FA) and a correlated effect on fitness. This study provides evidence to corroborate the hypothesis that asymmetry partly reflects DI and is correlated with a reduction in fitness measured by survival and reproduction in bats. We studied two colonies of the bat Carollia perspicillata in southeastern Brazil over 5 years, marking and recapturing individuals. Gaussian mixture models for signed Forearm Asymmetry (ForA) distribution indicated that ~20% of asymmetry variation was due to DI heterogeneity among individuals. ForA, body condition (Scaled Mass Index—SMI) and Forearm Length (ForL) were used as predictors of survival probability in Cormack‐Jolly‐Seber models. Asymmetry was negatively associated with survival, whereas SMI and ForL were positively associated. The male C. perspicillata defend sites within the roost that are favoured by female harems, but there are mating opportunities for bachelor males, leading to both territorial disputes and sperm competition. As predicted by sexual selection, ForA was negatively associated with relative Testicle Length, a measure of reproductive potential. In females, ForA was negatively associated with the probability of two pregnancies (as opposed to one) in a given breeding season. The effect magnitudes and directions of associations suggest that asymmetry, even though not perfectly reflecting DI variation, is a useful predictor for fitness components in C. perspicillata.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging infectious disease devastating hibernating North American bat populations that is caused by the psychrophilic fungus Geomyces destructans. Previous histopathological analysis demonstrated little evidence of inflammatory responses in infected bats, however few studies have compared other aspects of immune function between WNS-affected and unaffected bats. We collected bats from confirmed WNS-affected and unaffected sites during the winter of 2008-2009 and compared estimates of their circulating levels of total leukocytes, total immunoglobulins, cytokines and total antioxidants. Bats from affected and unaffected sites did not differ in their total circulating immunoglobulin levels, but significantly higher leukocyte counts were observed in bats from affected sites and particularly in affected bats with elevated body temperatures (above 20°C). Bats from WNS-affected sites exhibited significantly lower antioxidant activity and levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), a cytokine that induces T cell differentiation. Within affected sites only, bats exhibiting visible fungal infections had significantly lower antioxidant activity and levels of IL-4 compared to bats without visible fungal infections. Overall, bats hibernating in WNS-affected sites showed immunological changes that may be evident of attempted defense against G. destructans. Observed changes, specifically elevated circulating leukocytes, may also be related to the documented changes in thermoregulatory behaviors of affected bats (i.e. increased frequencies in arousal from torpor). Alterations in immune function may reflect expensive energetic costs associated with these processes and intrinsic qualities of the immunocapability of hibernating bats to clear fungal infections. Additionally, lowered antioxidant activity indicates a possible imbalance in the pro- versus antioxidant system, may reflect oxidative tissue damage, and should be investigated as a contributor to WNS-associated morbidity and mortality.",

            "abstractNote": "Invasive species are a major cause of species extinction in freshwater ecosystems, and crayﬁsh species are particularly pervasive. The invasive American signal crayﬁsh Pacifastacus leniusculus has impacts over a range of trophic levels, but particularly on benthic aquatic macroinvertebrates. Our study examined the effect on the macroinvertebrate community of removal trapping of signal crayﬁsh from UK rivers. Crayﬁsh were intensively trapped and removed from two tributaries of the River Thames to test the hypothesis that lowering signal crayﬁsh densities would result in increases in macroinvertebrate numbers and taxon richness. We removed 6181 crayﬁsh over four sessions, resulting in crayﬁsh densities that decreased toward the center of the removal sections. Conversely in control sections (where crayﬁsh were trapped and returned), crayﬁsh density increased toward the center of the section. Macroinvertebrate numbers and taxon richness were inversely correlated with crayﬁsh densities. Multivariate analysis of the abundance of each taxon yielded similar results and indicated that crayﬁsh removals had positive impacts on macroinvertebrate numbers and taxon richness but did not alter the composition of the wider macroinvertebrate community. Synthesis and applications: Our results demonstrate that non-eradication-oriented crayﬁsh removal programmes may lead to increases in the total number of macroinvertebrates living in the benthos. This represents the ﬁrst evidence that removing signal crayﬁsh from riparian systems, at intensities feasible during control attempts or commercial crayﬁshing, may be beneﬁcial for a range of sympatric aquatic macroinvertebrates.",

The new species (Myotis handleyi, sp. nov.) can be distinguished from other South American congeners by the following set of traits: dorsal fur long, silky, and bicolored with burnished tips; skull long; rostrum long and broad; frontals moderately to steeply sloping; sagittal crest absent or very low; plagiopatagium broadly attached to the foot at the level of the base of the toes; fringe of hairs along the trailing edge of uropatagium absent; and fur on uropatagium not reaching knees. We review Colombian and Venezuelan samples of Myotis, covering all of the currently recognized species known from these countries. Based on our analyses, we provide a sketch of the taxonomic diversity of the genus in Colombia and Venezuela, along with a key to their identification. Among other conclusions, we elevate M. nigricans caucensis to the species level; confirm that populations of M. nigricans from the opposite sides of the Andes represent the same taxon; retain J.A. Allen’s names M. esmeraldae, M. bondae, and M. maripensis in the synonymy of M. nigricans; and document clinal variation in size along an altitudinal gradient for M. nigricans, with larger specimens from higher elevations. This research, based on museum and field collections, is one of a series of studies by the senior author re-evaluating species limits among Neotropical Myotis.",

Vampyressa melissa and V. sinchi are restricted to the eastern slope of the Andes, while V. elisabethae only is known from Panama, in Central America. The species complex has received recent attention in terms of systematic reviews, which concluded in the description of two species: one from Panama (V. elisabethae) and one from Colombia (V. sinchi). Vampyressa melissa recently was reported from the eastern slopes of the Cordillera Oriental of Colombia, in the department of Casanare. However, morphological and genetic (Cytochrome b) comparisons showed that these specimens belong to an undescribed species of the genus. The new species is the smallest member of the V. melissa complex and has a unique set of morphological characters compared to other Vampyressa species. Molecular evidence shows that the new species is sister to V. melissa (sensu stricto) from Colombia and Peru, albeit with high genetic divergence (7.9%). Nevertheless, Cytochrome b sequences of V. elisabethae and V. sinchi still are unknown. This new species increases to six the number of species in the genus. Vampyressa melissa, V. sinchi, and the new species, exhibit restricted distributions in the eastern slopes of the Andean Cordillera, in specific altitudinal ranges. Because of geographic constraints, their biological rarity, and the high deforestation rates in their distributional area, we suggest that these three species must be considered as taxa threatened with extinction.",

The species was found at the National Natural Park Alto Fragua Indi-Wasi, Department of Caquetá, Colombia. This record extended the species distribution 1400 km north from the northernmost known locality in Huanhuachayo, Ayacucho, Peru. This finding suggests that G. koepckeae is distributed over middle elevations along the eastern slope of the Andean-Amazonia foothills in Peru and Colombia, similar to other Phyllostomid bats, such as Vampyressa melissa and Lonchophylla handleyi. We reviewed the threatened category of G. koepckeae, currently categorized as Data Deficient (DD), according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but considered as Endangered (EN) in recent papers. Based on this new record, we suggest that the species should be included in future assessments as Near Threatened (NT) or Vulnerable (VU) based on its wider distribution along the Andean-Amazonian foothills of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, and probably the Orinoco slope of the Andes of Colombia and Venezuela.",

Aiming at a better understanding of the dynamics of these processes, male little yellow-shouldered bats (Sturnira lilium) were captured during both the dry and rainy seasons and their reproductive and metabolic patterns were established. Testes were processed histologically for morphometric analysis by light microscopy. Plasma glucose and testosterone concentrations were determined, as well as liver and muscle glycogen, lipids, and protein. Data showed little variation in testicular morphometrical parameters and also in body energy reserves between the seasons evaluated. We conclude that occasional season variations in bodily energy reserves in S. lilium do not seem to present a major inﬂuence on testicular morphometry in this species, which may reﬂect a successful adaptation of S. lilium to its habitats.",

Based on recent work in museum collections, we discovered a second specimen of Myotis diminutus, collected in 1959. This specimen of Myotis diminutus comes from La Guayacana, Narin˜o, western Colombia (’ 135 km north from the type locality); and M. nigricans (Schinz, 1821) also was collected at the same locality. This record conﬁrms the distinctiveness of Myotis diminutus. This species is known from only the Choco´ ecoregion, one of the critical biodiversity hotspots on Earth. We have no evidence of living individuals. In this report we also investigate the relationships among Myotis nigricans from eastern and western sides of the Andes. Our results conﬁrm that populations from both sides of the Cordillera represent the same subspecies—Myotis nigricans nigricans.",

Along the east coast, its range is thought to extend as far south as the Great Dismal Swamp in coastal Virginia. We captured six M. septentrionalis in the northern coastal plain region of North Carolina. Field identiﬁcation was based on characters of ear and tragus length and conﬁrmed with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences. These captures signify the presence of a resident population of M. septentrionalis in the northern coastal plain of North Carolina. Future work is needed to document range limits and hibernation behavior of this species in the piedmont and coastal plain of North Carolina.",

            "abstractNote": "Bartonellae are emerging blood-borne bacteria that have been recovered from a wide range of mammalian species and arthropod vectors around the world. Bats are now recognized as a potential wildlife reservoir for a diverse number of Bartonella species, including the zoonotic Candidatus B. mayotimonensis. These bat-borne Bartonella species have also been detected in the obligate ectoparasites of bats, such as blood-feeding ﬂies, which could transmit these bacteria within bat populations. To better understand this potential for transmission, we investigated the relatedness between Bartonella detected or isolated from bat hosts sampled in Mexico and their ectoparasites. Bartonella spp. were identiﬁed in bat ﬂies collected on two bat species, with the highest prevalence in Trichobius parasiticus and Strebla wiedemanni collected from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). When comparing Bartonella sequences from a fragment of the citrate synthase gene (gltA), vectorassociated strains were diverse and generally close to, but distinct from, those recovered from their bacteremic bat hosts in Mexico. Complete Bartonella sequence concordance was observed in only one bat-vector pair. The diversity of Bartonella strains in bat ﬂies reﬂects the frequent host switch by bat ﬂies, as they usually do not live permanently on their bat host. It may also suggest a possible endosymbiotic relationship with these vectors for some of the Bartonella species carried by bat ﬂies, whereas others could have a mammalian host.",

Plecotus auritus is common, but in the decline in the UK and although there have been studies of its roost use in Scotland, little is known of its roost biology in the milder south-west of England. This study compared five internal and three landscape features of roosts in stone buildings with those of random and paired unoccupied buildings in Cornwall (UK) in order to determine the roost selectivity of the brown long-eared bat. Bats selected roosts mainly for their vicinity, and connection, to foraging habitat. Occupied buildings were thus more likely to be situated closer to deciduous woodland than random control buildings, and were connected through tree lines. Roosts were also found to have a roof space divided into more compartments than paired and random controls and no insulation These characteristics influence the building microclimate. These findings suggest that P. auritus is selective of its roosts both at the building and the landscape levels.",

            "abstractNote": "The floral traits of plants with specialized pollination systems both facilitate the primary pollinator and restrict other potential pollinators. To explore interactions between pollinators and floral traits of the genus\n              Burmeistera\n              , I filmed floral visitors and measured pollen deposition for 10 species in six cloud forest sites throughout northern Ecuador. Nine species were primarily bat‐pollinated (84–100% of pollen transfer); another (\n              B. rubrosepala\n              ) was exclusively hummingbird‐pollinated. According to a principal components analysis of 11 floral measurements, flowers of\n              B. rubrosepala\n              were morphologically distinct. Floral traits of all species closely matched traditional ornithophilous and chiropterophilous pollination syndromes; flowers of\n              B. rubrosepala\n              were bright red, lacked odor, opened in the afternoon, and had narrow corolla apertures and flexible pedicels, which positioned them below the foliage. Flowers of the bat‐pollinated species were dull‐colored, emitted odor, opened in the evening, and had wide apertures and rigid pedicels, which positioned them beyond the foliage. Aperture width appeared most critical to restricting pollination; hummingbirds visited wide flowers without contacting the reproductive parts, and bats did not visit the narrow flowers of\n              B. rubrosepala\n              . Aperture width may impose an adaptive trade‐off that favors the high degree of specialization in the genus. Other floral measurements were highly variable amongst bat‐pollinated species, including stigma exsertion, calyx lobe morphology, and pedicel length. Because multiple species of\n              Burmeistera\n              often coexist, such morphological diversity may reduce pollen competition by encouraging pollinator fidelity and/or spatially partitioning pollinator's bodies.",

We extracted RNA from 312 spleen samples from bats captured in Zambia over a period of 4 years (2008–2011). Semi-nested RT-PCR detected a total of 25 (8%) positive samples for paramyxoviruses which were then directly sequenced and analyzed using phylogenetic analysis. Among the positive samples, seven novel paramyxoviruses were detected. Five viruses were closely related to the genus Henipavirus, while two viruses were related to the unclassified Bat paramyxoviruses from Ghana and Congo Brazzaville. Our study identified novel Henipavirus-related and unrelated viruses using RT-PCR in fruit bats from Kansaka National Park and indicated the presence of similar Bat paramyxoviruses originating from wide geographic areas, suggesting the ability of bats to harbor and transmit viruses. The presence of these viruses in fruit bats might pose a public health risk.",

            "abstractNote": "The fungus Geomyces destructans is the causative agent of white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease that has killed millions of North American hibernating bats. We describe a real-time TaqMan PCR test that detects DNA from G. destructans by targeting a portion of the multicopy intergenic spacer region of the rRNA gene complex. The test is highly sensitive, consistently detecting as little as 3.3 fg genomic DNA from G. destructans. The real-time PCR test specifically amplified genomic DNA from G. destructans but did not amplify target sequence from 54 closely related fungal isolates (including 43 Geomyces spp. isolates) associated with bats. The test was qualified further by analyzing DNA extracted from 91 bat wing skin samples, and PCR results matched histopathology findings. These data indicate the real-time TaqMan PCR method described herein is a sensitive, specific and rapid test to detect DNA from G. destructans and provides a valuable tool for WNS diagnostics and research.",

The genus is restricting to southern México and Central and South America, and, up until now, has included six species. This paper increases the number to seven species, five of which are known from Colombia. The new species differs from the others in overall coloration, coloration banding of the pelage, forearm length, shape and measurements of the skull, arrangement and shapes of the teeth, and shape of the ascending portion of the mandibular ramus. The new species is similar in some external and cranial measurements to C. perspicillata, but differs from it in skull shape, arrangement of the teeth, and size. The new species is one of the larger ones of the genus.",

Because bats ﬂy and have large surface-to-volume ratios, they potentially have high rates of RWL and CWL. Most species of small insectivorous bats have the ability to reduce their body temperature (Tb) at rest, which substantially reduces energy expenditure and water loss. We hypothesized that bats reduce evaporative water loss during bouts of deep hypothermia (torpor) by decreasing RWL and CWL. We measured Tb, RWL, CWL, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) in Kuhl’s pipistrelle Pipistrellus kuhlii, a small insectivorous bat. In support of our hypothesis, we found that RWL decreased with decreasing RMR. We found that CWL was lower in torpid individuals than in normothermic bats; however, bats in deep torpor had similar or higher CWL than bats in shallow torpor, suggesting that they exert a less effective physiological control over CWL when in deep torpor. Because insectivorous bats spend most of their lives in torpor or hibernation, the regulation of CWL in different heterothermic states has relevant ecological and evolutionary consequences.",

This recently discovered structure develops exclusively during the mating season that occurs once a year between November and December in populations of L. curasoae from northern Venezuela. Although the dorsal patch that develops in males has unique chemical characteristics possibly involved in female attraction, we suggest that this trait also sends distinct visual cues regarding the health status of males. We evaluated the postulated association between dorsal patch shape (symmetry) and ectoparasite load (streblid batflies) in males of L. curasoae. To do so, we quantified the shape of dorsal patches on males to test the hypothesis that streblid load was related to this variable. Over 2,000 streblid batflies of two different species (Nycterophilia coxata and Trichobius sphaeronotus) were recovered from 130 individuals (0 = 16 streblids/bat). Among these batflies, N. coxata was the most abundant species found on L. curasoae (2,042 individuals, 95.0% prevalence). Males with dorsal patches had significantly lower batfly loads when compared with males without dorsal patches and with females. Males with the most symmetrical dorsal patches also had the lowest batfly loads. Our results suggest that the odoriferous dorsal patches produced in males of L. curasoae also convey visual cues to female mates as signals of good health.",

Roost occupancy patterns and characteristics of palm trees or palm oases important for roost selection across the Colorado Desert are unknown. We surveyed 41 palm oasis sites throughout the Colorado Desert and found 33 of those locations to have western yellow bat activity, and we conﬁrmed day roosts at 19 sites. Compared to unoccupied palm sites, bats were found roosting in palm oases that were at higher elevations, had evidence of new palm growth, and where palms had a full range of skirt lengths. Our ﬁndings have implications for managing palm oases for western yellow bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Adult males of the long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris curasoae) produce odoriferous ‘‘sebaceous’’ secretions in the interscapular region (dorsal patch), exclusively during the mating season (November–December). These dorsal patches might play a role in mate selection by L. curasoae in northern Venezuela. We evaluated differences between body traits of males with and without dorsal patches to determine whether these structures could be used by females as indicators of male quality, examined whether the size of the dorsal patch shows a relationship with other body traits during the mating season, and investigated the physical and behavioral development of dorsal patches. Thirty-seven percent of all males sampled (n 5 99) showed conspicuous dorsal patches during the mating season in November and December. Males with conspicuous dorsal patches had larger testes, smaller body masses, lower body condition indices, and lower ectoparasite loads than males without dorsal patches. Larger testes and lower ectoparasite loads suggest that the dorsal patch could be signaling male quality and readiness for mating. A typical dorsal patch covered approximately 1.7 cm2 of a male’s interscapular region, but size of this structure did not vary with any of the body traits examined. We describe a novel, stereotypic behavior performed by male L. curasoae, which we call ‘‘smearing behavior,’’ and suggest that this is associated with development of the dorsal patch because males appear to smear different body fluids onto this patch. We further suggest that sebaceous secretions in the interscapular region would not be the determining factor in dorsal patch development.",

            "abstractNote": "In the absence of visual cues, chemical signals are especially important for nocturnal mammals such as bats, because they facilitate individual recognition, communication, and mate selection. In a recent study, it was reported that adult males of the Curaçaoan longnosed bat, Leptonycteris curasoae, develop an odoriferous dorsal patch during the short mating season. It was postulated that dorsal patches signal health condition to females, and that females are preferentially attracted to the odor of males with dorsal patches. The chemical characterization of the dorsal patch is key to understanding its implications in chemical communication in a sexual context. In the present study, organic compounds collected from dorsal patches of males of L. curasoae from northwestern Venezuela were extracted using solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) techniques and tentatively identified using GC-MS (Gas ChromatographyMass Spectrometry). Nineteen compounds were present in 75% or more of the patches examined: 3-methyl-2-buten-1-thiol, acetic acid, 2’-aminoacetophenone, diacetyl, 2-pentanone, 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, 2-nonanone, acetamide, 2-undecanone, piperidinone, 4-methylquinazoline, 2,4-dimethylquinazoline, 3-methyl-2,5-pyrrolidinedione, 2-butanone, 2-methylfuran, 3-methyl-2-butenal, δ-valerolactone, 3-methyl-2-butenoic acid, and 2-methyl-2-butenoic acid. Although some of these compounds have been reported as important in female attraction among other male mammals during their respective breeding seasons, the actual function of these chemicals in L. curasoae remains to be determined. Some of these compounds have also been identified as natural insecticides, and this may be associated with lower ectoparasite loads reported on males with dorsal patches. These results, when considered along with previous observations, suggest that the dorsal patch in males of L. curasoae promotes the attraction of females during the mating season, and/or provides protection against ectoparasites.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats have been implicated as reservoirs of relapsing fever group spirochaetes since the beginning of the last century. Recently, bat-associated spirochaetes have been reported as human pathogens. In 1968, a spirochaete was detected in blood of the bat Natalus tumidirostris captured inside the Macaregua cave, Colombia. Data on this microorganism were never published again. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of Borrelia DNA in blood from bats of Macaregua cave. We performed molecular analyses using a genus-specific real-time PCR targeting the 16S rRNA to detect DNA of Borrelia in blood samples from 46 bats captured in the Macaregua cave. Positive samples were submitted to a battery of PCRs aiming to amply Borrelia 16S rRNA, flaB, glpQ, p66, ospC, clpA, clpX, nifS, pepX, pyrG, recG, rplB and uvrA genes. Seventeen samples were positive for Borrelia after real-time PCR. With the exception of flaB gene, attempts to amplify further loci were unsuccessful. Nucleotide and amino acid divergences of four flaB haplotypes characterized from blood of Carollia perspicillata showed Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) as the most closely related group. A phylogenetic tree including 74 sequences of the genus confirmed this trend, since Borrelia genotypes detected in bats from Macaregua formed a monophyletic group basally positioned to Bbsl. Our results suggest that Borrelia genotypes characterized from bats roosting in the Macaregua cave might constitute a new taxon within the genus. This is the first molecular characterization of a Borrelia sp. in Colombia.",

            "abstractNote": "Evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) are ubiquitous in the southeastern United States, but only one maternity colony occurs in the Great Lakes region, in Michigan, and it is the northernmost colony known in North America. We hypothesized that diet would vary throughout the season and between years and that diet of evening bats in northern areas would differ from diet of those in more southern parts of the continent. Almost 600 fecal pellets of evening bats were collected and analyzed from May through August 2006–2007. Thirteen orders of insects and two orders of arachnids were found, but Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Hemiptera composed 87% of dietary volume. Lepidoptera, which forms a substantial portion of the diet for most vespertilionids in eastern North America, contributed only 4.7% to the volume. Diet was broadly similar to evening bats in the core of their range, although evening bats in Michigan incorporated substantially more Diptera into their diet. Dietary composition and diversity differed little between years but showed variation among weeks within years. The lack of dietary specialization and similarity in major components in different parts of the range suggest that availability of prey or dietary competition with other species at the ordinal level are not factors limiting the northern distribution of the evening bat.",

The genus Cryptosporidium infects various vertebrates and causes a diarrheal disease known as cryptosporidiosis. Many epidemiological studies in wild animals have been performed; however, most of them relied on only PCR-based detection because of the difficulty of performing pathological analyses. Accordingly, the natural host and pathogenicity of Cryptosporidium bat genotypes remain unclear. In this study, we captured Eptesicus nilssonii (Northern bats) in Hokkaido, Japan. Of the three intestinal samples obtained, two were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. and one was positive for Eimeria spp. The corresponding microorganisms were also confirmed histopathologically. We detected the novel Cryptosporidium bat genotype XII and Eimeria rioarribaensis in bat intestine.",

The ability of species to use cues they did not evolve with is important in understanding flexibility in behaviour. We observed Neotropical nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaga soricina) feeding at Old World banana flowers (Musa acuminata) in a Belize garden. The flowers produce a rich source of nectar that is exposed as a bract lifts before dusk. We tested the hypothesis that the bracts serve as beacons to foraging bats and discuss this approach and the use of acoustic information by bats feeding at flowers. We ensonified a bract with cues like those of echolocating G. soricina, which revealed the production of strong echoes from the bract. Additionally, the removal of bracts from the flowers influenced the bats’ flower-visiting behaviour. We suggest that the bats use the echoes from the bract opportunistically as a cue to find the nectar source. Our findings provide an example of an interaction between a plant and flower visitor not reflecting a shared evolutionary past.",

Pregnant bats did not use the day roost at night, but lactating females returned 2–4 times/night for 32 ± 7 (SE) min/visit, presumably to feed their young. Both pregnant and lactating females night roosted as solitary individuals in trees within their foraging areas; night roosting occurred 0–6 times/night for 14 ± 1 min each time. Bats foraged for most of the night, with the total duration of ﬂight equalling 375 ± 16 min/night. The bats used 13 different foraging areas that were located 0.5–4.2 km from the day roost. Bats did not ﬂy over open ﬁelds but travelled along wooded corridors, even though such behaviour increased commuting distance by 55 ± 11%. Current models of habitat suitability for this endangered species should be modiﬁed, taking into account the use of wooded commuting corridors and the large home range of these bats.",

            "abstractNote": "With 70 named species and multiple morphologically cryptic lineages, the genus Hipposideros is a diverse and taxonomically contentious group of insectivorous bats in the Old World tropics. Half of the named species and most of the cryptic diversity in Hipposideros are concentrated in the bicolor species group. Here we resolve the taxonomic status of Hipposideros bicolor (Temminck, 1834), the species group’s namesake. Two morphologically cryptic but acoustically and genetically distinct lineages of H. bicolor co-occur in peninsular Malaysia and Thailand. Pending taxonomic revision, these lineages were named according to the average frequency of maximum energy of echolocation calls of populations in central peninsular Malaysia, H. bicolor-131 and H. bicolor-142. To determine the taxonomic status of the two lineages we measured cranial characters from all available type specimens in the H. bicolor species group, and collected morphometric, acoustic and mitochondrial DNA sequence data for H. bicolor-131, H. bicolor-142, and closely related lineages, from multiple localities on the Malay peninsula and Borneo. Consistent with prior studies, acoustic and genetic analyses strongly support species status for H. bicolor-131 and H. bicolor-142. We find subtle but significant differences in cranial characters, including a longer skull and longer upper and lower tooth rows in H. bicolor131 relative to H. bicolor-142. Most importantly, inclusion of cranial measurements for type specimens in the H. bicolor species group indicates that H. bicolor-131 should retain the species name, while H. bicolor-142 is distinct from all previously named species. We therefore provide a complete description for this new species of bat from Southeast Asia, Hipposideros kunzi sp. nov.",

It is cave‐dwelling and does not appear to occur in West Africa. In this study, reproduction of two populations, one at Suswa in the Rift Valley, latitude 1°5′S and the other at Ithundu in the Chyulu Hills, latitude 2°30′S was investigated and compared. Regular monthly samples from both populations were collected commencing in March 1970 and running on to February 1972. The bats were processed in the laboratory for pregnancies, weights of testes and foetuses and other measurements and observations. Seasonality in the occurrence of pregnancies was observed in both populations, that is, from October to January only. Also the adult males realized a peak in their mean testicular weight in August, a short period just before the onset of pregnancies thus indicating the most likely time of mating. The female sexual cycle at Ithundu appears to be geared to the rainfall regime as measured at Makindu Meteorological Station about 10 km away. The male sexual cycle, on the other hand, shows a peak in the very dry months suggesting that such a dry spell may be more important than the rain. Molossid bats exhibit variation in their breeding cycles.\n              \n            \n            \n              Summary\n              \n                The breeding cycles of two populations of the cave dwelling insectivorous bat,\n                O. martiensseni\n                have been elucidated. In one population at Ithundu, the adult females show evidence of pregnancies from October to January and the adult males exhibit a peak in their sexual cycle in August. In the Suswa population, a similar state of affairs obtains. In both populations, there is the curious tendency for pregnancies to occur also in May at Suswa and Ithundu; and also in June in Ithundu. But as such pregnancies are not sustained in the ensuing months and are of extremely low magnitude, they cannot be regarded as constituting another breeding season. The peak in the adult male cycle occurred during the dry spell from June to September. The peak in pregnancies at Ithundu appears to coincide with the peak rainfall and it is possible that the same is true of Suswa. Considering that these bats are seasonal in their breeding and that they are only monotocous, their recruitment rate as shown by their age distribution is low.",

We used 3D geometric morphometrics to compare the shapes of skulls of the two lineages collected at various localities in southern Africa. Size and shape variation was predominantly attributed to selective forces; the between-­population variance (B) was not proportional to the within-­population variance (W). Modularity was evident in the crania of R. simulator but absent in the crania of R. cf. simulator and the mandibles of both species. The skulls of the two lineages thus appeared to be under different selection pressures, despite the overlap in their distributions. Difference in the crania of R. cf. simulator was centered largely on the nasal dome region of R. cf. simulator but on the cranium and mandibles of R. simulator. It is likely that the size and shape of the nasal dome, which acts as a frequency-­dependent acoustic horn, is more crucial in R. cf. simulator than in R. simulator because of the higher echolocation frequencies used by R. cf. simulator. A larger nasal dome in R. cf. simulator would allow the emission of higher intensity pulses, resulting in comparable detection distances to that of R. simulator. In contrast, selection pressure is probably more pronounced on the mandibles and cranium of R. simulator to compensate for the loss in bite force because of its elongated rostrum. The predominance of selection probably reflects the stringent association between environment and the optimal functioning of phenotypic characters associated with echolocation and feeding in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Natural selection and drift can act on populations individually, simultaneously or in tandem and our understanding of phenotypic divergence depends on our ability to recognize the contribution of each. According to the quantitative theory of evolution, if an organism has diversified through neutral evolutionary processes (mutation and drift), variation of phenotypic characteristics between different geographic localities (B) should be directly proportional to the variation within localities (W), that is, B ∝ W. Significant deviations from this null model imply that non-­neutral forces such as natural selection are acting on a phenotype. We investigated the relative contributions of drift and selection to intraspecific diversity using southern African horseshoe bats as a test case. We characterized phenotypic diversity across the distributional range of Rhinolophus simulator (n = 101) and Rhinolophus swinnyi (n = 125) using several traits associated with flight and echolocation. Our results suggest that geographic variation in both species was predominantly caused by disruptive natural selection (B was not directly proportional to W). Evidence for correlated selection (co-­selection) among traits further confirmed that our results were not compatible with drift. Selection rather than drift is likely the predominant evolutionary process shaping intraspecific variation in traits that strongly impact fitness.",

To provide information on their keystone role, the study recorded instances of seed dispersal and measured seed germination rate of two and four plant species respectively. A total of 88 roosting locations (18, 20 and 50 from CCLH, RH and FRH respectively) were studied. P. voeltzkowi abundance was estimated using patch counts conducted for four days in dry season (February) and four days in wet season (April). Transect and seed germination experiment were used to estimate seeds dispersal distances and germination rates respectively. The number of P. voeltzkowi was lower in the wet season and highest in RH. A positive relationship was found between P. voeltzkowi abundance and roosting tree canopy diameter. Fruits were dominant food item recorded, eighteen tree species were utilised as day roosts and fourteen were food source for P. voeltzkowi. Compared to unhandled seeds, handled seeds showed high germination rate. Maximum dispersal distances recorded were 560 and 200m for fig and mango seeds respectively.",

Previous studies revealed the population history of R. ferrumequinum from Europe and most Asian regions, yet there continue to be arguments about their evolutionary process in Northeast Asia. In this study, we obtained mitochondrial DNA cyt b and D-loop data of R. ferrumequinum from Northeast China, South Korea and Japan to clarify their phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary process. Our results indicate a highly supported monophyletic group of Northeast Asian greater horseshoe bats, in which Japanese populations formed a single clade and clustered into the mixed branches of Northeast Chinese and South Korean populations. We infer that R. ferrumequinum in Northeast Asia originated in Northeast China and South Korea during a cold glacial period, while some ancestors likely arrived in Japan by flying or land bridge and subsequently adapted to the local environment. Consequently, during the warm Eemian interglaciation, the Korea Strait, between Japan and South Korea, became a geographical barrier to Japanese and inland populations, while the Changbai Mountains, between China and North Korea, did not play a significant role as a barrier between Northeast China and South Korea populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Evolutionary processes can be influenced by several factors, such as geographic isolation, environmental selection, and sensory variation. For most nocturnal bats, echolocation is the primary sensory system used to prey and communicate, and plays important roles in chiropteran diversification and evolution. Understanding the relative contribution of geography, the environment, and this sensory system to population genetic divergence can elucidate the processes involved in bat incipient speciation and evolution. In this study, we collected spatial and environmental information, echolocation calls, as well as the previously published genetic data (six microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene) of widely distributed Rhinolophus episcopus populations to test three hypotheses for nuclear and mitochondrial divergence (isolation by distance, isolation by environment, and isolation by sensory variation) and unveil the factors that drive intraspecific genetic differentiation. The moderate level of nuclear differentiation was correlated with geographic/ spatial distance and acoustic variation, whereas the relatively high level of mitochondrial differentiation was mainly associated with acoustic divergence. No significant correlation was observed between genetic divergence and environmental variables. Among the three factors, acoustic divergence explained the highest percentage of both nuclear and mitochondrial divergence. Thus, our results indicate that sensory variation may have played important roles in driving population isolation early in bat speciation, which is consistent with the hypothesis of isolation by sensory variation. Our study emphasizes the need to consider more factors, especially sensory traits, and combine multiple statistical methods in landscape genetic studies to test their potential contributions to driving population divergence.",

            "abstractNote": "The endangerment mechanisms of various species are a focus of studies on biodiversity and conservation biology. Hipposideros pomona is an endangered species, but the reasons behind its endangerment remain unclear. We investigated the endangerment mechanisms of H. pomona using mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA, and microsatellite loci markers. The results showed that the nucleotide diversity of mitochondria DNA and heterozygosity of microsatellite markers were high (π = 0.04615, HO = 0.7115), whereas the nucleotide diversity of the nuclear genes was low (THY: π = 0.00508, SORBS2: π = 0.00677, ACOX2: π = 0.00462, COPS7A: π = 0.00679). The phylogenetic tree and median-joining network based on mitochondrial DNA sequences clustered the species into three clades, namely North Vietnam-Fujian, Myanmar-West Yunnan, and Laos-Hainan clades. However, joint analysis of nuclear genes did not exhibit clustering. Analysis of molecular variance revealed a strong population genetic structure; IMa2 analysis did not reveal significant gene flow between all groups (p > .05), and isolation-by-distance analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances (p < .05). The mismatch distribution analysis, neutral test, and Bayesian skyline plots revealed that the H. pomona population were relatively stable and exhibited a contraction trend. The results implied that H. pomona exhibits female philopatry and male-biased dispersal. The Hengduan Mountains could have acted as a geographical barrier for gene flow between the North Vietnam-Fujian clade and the Myanmar-West Yunnan clade, whereas the Qiongzhou Strait may have limited interaction between the Hainan populations and other clades. The warm climate during the second interglacial Quaternary period (c. 0.33 Mya) could have been responsible for species differentiation, whereas the cold climate during the late Quaternary last glacial maximum (c. 10 ka BP) might have caused the overall contraction of species. The lack of significant gene flow in nuclear microsatellite loci markers among the different populations investigated reflects recent habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities; thus, on-site conservation of the species and restoration of gene flow corridors among populations need immediate implementation.",

By using these data, we develop empirical growth curves, derive growth rates, establish age-predictive equations, and compare growth parameters based on three nonlinear growth models. Neonates of M. macrodactylus were born within a half-month period, with length of forearm averaging ca. 38.4% of the size of adult females and body mass averaging ca. 39.6% of their mother’s body mass. Length of forearm increased linearly until 14 days after birth (growth rate = 1.20 mm/day), as did body mass until 11 days after birth (growth rate = 0.32 g/day). The length of the total gap of the fourth metacarpal-phalangeal joint decreased linearly from 13 days to 45 days of birth. Two most appropriate linear regression equations predicting the age of young bats were derived from forearm length (0 ± SE) from 15.35 ± 0.96 mm to 33.24 ± 1.87 mm and the length of the epiphyseal gap from 13 to 45 days. These two equations make it possible to estimate the age of pups from 1 to 45 days of age in M. macrodactylus. Of the three nonlinear growth models (logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy), the logistic equation provides the best fit to the empirical curves for length of forearm and body mass.",

Blood samples were collected from 40 wild bats. Ten haematological parameters were determined using an automated haematological analyser. Morphological differentiation of leukocytes was performed in blood smears. No significant differences were revealed in the main parameters of peripheral blood between adult males and females of Myotis dasycneme except for the content of haemoglobin (p = 0.01) and leukocytes (p = 0.02). Data show that significant differences exist between adult and subadult females in erythropoiesis (RBC, HGB, HCT, and MCV). Thus, with age, the number of erythrocytes and the haemoglobin level increase (p < 0.05), but the leukocytic chain remains relatively stable. Changes in haematological parameters were observed in the bats caught in the season of preparation for long hibernation (6–7 months). Conclusion: The blood system of Myotis dasycneme from natural populations in the Ural Mountains was investigated for the first time. It was found that bat growth and development are accompanied by significant changes in red blood cell indicators whereas the white blood cell count remains stable. Adaptive lability of red blood cells in bats allows them to respond adequately to seasonal environmental conditions.",

In general, seeds ingested showed more rapid germination times and higher overall germination rates than untreated seeds. The bat Glossophaga longirostris, and the birds Mimus gilvus and Tachyphonus rufus seem to be the most efﬁcient cacti dispersers in terms of quality of treatment. The increment of germination speed and particularly the decrease of imbibition time, could favour the probability of germination in dry areas such as arid and semi-arid environments.",

Like other homeotherms, bats release heat during digestion of dietary macronutrients. Despite males and females of the same species exhibiting different foraging behaviour, empirical support for sex differences in blood glucose and body surface temperature in fruit bats is poor. Moreover, while flight affects postprandial metabolism, whether such effects are different in each sex of fruit bats is unclear. Here, we studied these questions in the fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx. We first assessed whether there are sex differences in the postprandial level of blood glucose and body surface temperature over time in rested bats. We then assessed whether flight affects outcomes of sex differences in both traits. We found that the estimated marginal means of both traits were generally higher in females than males, in rested bats. Notably, the sex difference in both traits was only significant at specific sampling time of the assay. Further, the trait means significantly differed between the sexes only in the rested, but not active, bats, meaning that signals of sex difference in metabolic traits eroded when bats were active. Taken together, our findings suggest that in C. sphinx, the sex specificity in the expression of metabolic traits is significantly dependent on physical activity.",

            "abstractNote": "Daubenton’s bat Myotis daubentonii is one of the most common bat species of Europe, hunting its prey in the surroundings of water bodies, with different microhabitats. To explore the local adaptability to different environmental conditions, we compared the diet of Daubenton’s bats at four different sites in a lake landscape in northern Germany with a main focus on prey diversity. Bats were caught (n = 85) in mist nets for collecting individual faecal pellets (n = 276). Pellets were dissected and the occurrence of identifiable pieces of each prey group was evaluated and grouped in five different frequency groups. We found 17 different groups of arthropods among the prey, with a clear dominance of Chironomidae and Trichoptera. There were significant differences among the sampling sites in prey diversity but not in prey richness.The changes in prey diversity were associated with sample sites. We conclude that on a local scale there is low variability in diet of Daubenton’s bat caused by hunting in various habitat structures in the surroundings of water bodies. Our results highlight the ecological flexibility of M. daubentonii, which could be an explanation for the commonness of M. daubentonii across Europe in comparison to the rather rare pond bat (Myotis dasycneme), which has similar habitats and main prey group preferences.",

            "abstractNote": "Around 60 % of all bat species occur in islands, and nearly one in four is an insular endemic. Bats are often the only native terrestrial mammals in oceanic islands, and despite increasing anthropogenic pressures, little is known about the distribution, natural history, and population status of most insular bat populations. The sub-tropical archipelago of Madeira is composed of the volcanic islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and Desertas and is home to the Macaronesian endemic Pipistrellus maderensis, to the endemic subspecies Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus, and to Plecotus austriacus. Pipistrellus maderensis is known to both Madeira and Porto Santo, whereas the other two species have only been recorded in the former. However, no bats have been recorded in Porto Santo for over 15 years, raising fears that bats are probably extinct in the island. In July 2021, we conducted an island-wide acoustic survey using AudioMoth passive acoustic recorders, leading to the detection of Pipistrellus maderensis in 28 out of the 46 sampling sites (60 %). The species’ activity was strongly associated with artiﬁcial water sources, and genetic samples from six captured individuals revealed that the populations of Pipistrellus maderensis in Porto Santo and Madeira have a close phylogenetic afﬁnity. Furthermore, using DNA metabarcoding, we found that the species feeds on a wide variety of insects, including several economically important pest species and disease vectors. These ﬁndings emphasise the need to target more conservation and research efforts towards extant island bat populations and the potential ecosystem services they provide.",

Its taxonomic status is unclear, either as a valid species or as a subspecies of M. velifer (J. A. Allen, 1890). In order to assess its taxonomic status, the objective of this study was to examine phylogenetic relationships of M. peninsularis, using molecular and geometric morphometric data. Two mitochondrial genes were analyzed: cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb). The phylogenetic analysis (maximum likelihood and Bayesian Inference) showed that M. peninsularis and M. velifer were sister groups, collectively forming a monophyletic assemblage. We observed less than 2% of genetic distance in the Cytb, considered an interval at the subspecies level. The geometric morphometric analysis showed differences in skull shape. We obtained three morphotypes: M. peninsularis (Baja California group), M. velifer incautus (northern population) and M. v. velifer (southern population). The most important differences were located in the braincase (ventral, dorsal and lateral view). The lateral view was the most discriminating. The Cape Region specimens had the sagittal crest more procumbent in the front than the rear of the braincase. The slope line at the rostral lateral view was more abrupt in M. velifer populations. Morphologically, the three lineages tended to possess the same normal variation as the entire Mexican population of M. velifer but with a specific morphotype associated to its distribution. In a combined molecular and landmark configuration of the phylogenetic analysis, the ancestral shape corresponded to an intermediate shape between M. peninsularis and M. velifer, presenting a similar variation to the one of intra-specific level in M. velifer. We considered M. peninsularis a junior-synonym of M. velifer.",

We found that Orii’s ﬂying-fox potentially pollinated seven native plant species. Its feeding behavior and plant morphological traits suggested that this species is an important pollinator of Schima wallichii liukiuensis and Mucuna macrocarpa. The ﬂying-fox also dispersed the seeds of 20 native plant species. The seeds of all plants eaten by the ﬂying-fox were usually dropped beneath the parent tree, although large fruits of four plant species were occasionally brought to the feeding roosts in the mouth, with the maximum dispersal distance—for Terminalia catappa—estimated to be 126 m. Small seeds of 11 species (mostly Ficus species) were dispersed around other trees, during the subsequent feeding session, through the digestive tracts, with the mean dispersal distance for ingested seeds estimated at 150 ± 230.3 m (±SD); the maximum dispersal distance was 1833 m. A comparison of the seed dispersal of available fruits according to the size of ﬂying-foxes and other frugivores suggested that the seed dispersal of eight plant species producing large fruits mostly depended on Orii’s ﬂying-fox. On Okinawa-jima Island, the Orii’s ﬂying-fox plays an important role as a pollinator of two native plants and as a long-distance seed disperser of Ficus species, and it functions as a limited agent of seed dispersal for plants producing large fruits on Okinawa-jima Island.",

We examined the food habits of Pteropus dasymallus at two sites with different flora, a forested and an urbanized area in a subtropical island. The plant species used differed between the two sites, and the degree of use of three food types (fruits, flowers, and leaves) also changed. These results suggest that P. dasymallus shows dietary plasticity according to food conditions of living locations. The plant diversity was higher in the urbanized area than in the forested area, however, actual diet breadth (Levins’ index) was lower in the urbanized area, due to the intensive use of specific plant species in the urbanized area. The bats used Ficus microcarpa, as a core plant, which long fruiting periods and high abundance in the urbanized area. In addition, we compared these findings on the diet breadths to those reported in other Pteropus species, and suggested that diet breadths of flying foxes might be generalized in subtropics in which food shortages occur irregularly and be specialized in tropics with a high abundance of specific plants with long fruiting periods.",

The present subfossils include the Okinawa spiny rat Tokudaia muenninki, Ryukyu long-furred rat Diplothrix legata, Watase’s shrew Crocidura watasei, and an in­ determinate species of bat. With the exception of C. watasei, these species no longer exist in southern Okinawajima. Predominance of these rat species suggests that the environment around the fissure was densely forested during these ages. However, the presence of C. watasei remains implies that open habitats also existed in the middle Holocene. Tokudaia muenninki remains from the fissure show that it had survived on southern Okinawajima until the middle Holocene. The upper first molar widths and lower molar row lengths in the late Pleistocene T. muenninki material from the fissure are significantly smaller than those of extant conspecific specimens, whereas the upper molar row length appears to be similar to those of the extant conspecifics. These findings suggest that the molar proportions of T. muenninki have changed since the late Pleistocene.",

            "abstractNote": "Noack’s round-leaf bat Hipposideros cf. ruber is widely distributed in sub-Saharan Africa. Here, we present some aspects of its ecology from two caves in central Ghana. Our main objective was to assess the nightly and annual flight activity and to examine the influences of ambient temperature on flight activity. We tested the hypothesis that flight activity of the species is concentrated at certain periods of the night and the year using mist-netting data from 2,712 captured bats. We found no evidence for annual fluctuations in flight activity, probably due to no distinct seasonal limitation of food resources, no migration, and the lack of extreme environmental conditions in the study area. Our hypothesis of concentrated nightly flight activity was confirmed for one cave but not for the other. Flight activity was concentrated early in the night (20:00, 21:00 and 22:00 hours) at one cave, possibly to take advantage of locally available early active prey insects, while it was uniformly distributed throughout the night at the other. Lastly, we found a reduction in the flight activity of H. cf. ruber when there was a distinct drop in temperature over the night. We therefore suggest the reduction in flight activity may result from the direct effects of temperature on prey abundance as the bats responded by reducing activity to avoid excessive prey search costs.",

Local convex hulls were used to estimate home range sizes of the bats. Based on 1,192 fixes, the mean (± SD) home range size was 36 ha ± 35 ha. Individual home range size ranged from six to 95 ha and frequently overlapped among individuals. The foraging area covered 50% of the home range while the core area formed 2%. The mean maximum foraging distance was 1.1 km, with individual distances up to 2.6 km, suggesting Hipposideros aff. ruber is capable of covering relatively long distances. Male bats returned to the cave more often than females during the night. Although the cave was the main roost, each bat also had individual night roosts on trees.",

To augment bat conservation in such highly modified agro-environments, we evaluated the foraging decisions of the widely distributed Noack’s round-leaf bat (Hipposideros aff. ruber) in a Ghanaian agro-environment for two factors: (a) foraging durations and (b) habitat selection from radio telemetry data collected from 13 bats. We hypothesized that it opportunistically selects foraging habitats in proportion to its availability. Our compositional analysis revealed, however, a nonrandom use of habitats. A ranking matrix indicated Hipposideros aff. ruber uses all available habitats but strongly preferred seminatural habitats dominated by fallow lands. Cocoa farms were predominantly used as flight paths for commuting between roosts and other nearby habitats during foraging. We observed a mean foraging duration of 109 min (SD ¼ 62 min) per night for the species. In conclusion, our data suggest that (a) they are flexible in selecting all habitat types in the agro-environment but strongly preferred fallow matrices, (b) the provision of canopy trees within the agro-environment serves as flight paths for commuting from roost to habitats offering higher prey densities, and (3) the maintenance of fallow matrices as conservation units in sub-Saharan agro-environments helps augment conservation efforts of the species.",

            "abstractNote": "Around 60 % of all bat species occur in islands, and nearly one in four is an insular endemic. Bats are often the only native terrestrial mammals in oceanic islands, and despite increasing anthropogenic pressures, little is known about the distribution, natural history, and population status of most insular bat populations. The sub-tropical archipelago of Madeira is composed of the volcanic islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and Desertas and is home to the Macaronesian endemic Pipistrellus maderensis, to the endemic subspecies Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus, and to Plecotus austriacus. Pipistrellus maderensis is known to both Madeira and Porto Santo, whereas the other two species have only been recorded in the former. However, no bats have been recorded in Porto Santo for over 15 years, raising fears that bats are probably extinct in the island. In July 2021, we conducted an island-wide acoustic survey using AudioMoth passive acoustic recorders, leading to the detection of Pipistrellus maderensis in 28 out of the 46 sampling sites (60 %). The species’ activity was strongly associated with artificial water sources, and genetic samples from six captured individuals revealed that the populations of Pipistrellus maderensis in Porto Santo and Madeira have a close phylogenetic affinity. Furthermore, using DNA metabarcoding, we found that the species feeds on a wide variety of insects, including several economically important pest species and disease vectors. These findings emphasise the need to target more conservation and research efforts towards extant island bat populations and the potential ecosystem services they provide.",

Here, we report a case of dicephalic parapagus conjoined twins in the Neotropical phyllostomid genus Artibeus. These twins are males and present separated heads and necks, but a conjoined trunk with an expanded upper thoracic region. They developed two complete forelimbs and two complete hindlimbs, all laterally to the trunk. There is a volume in the upper midback and between the heads that resembles a third rudimentary medial forelimb, but X-ray images only suggest the presence of medial skeletal elements of the pectoral girdle (clavicle and scapulae) in this region. The X-ray images also show that vertebral columns run separated from head until the base of lumbar region, where they form a single structure. Using ultrasound images, we detected the presence of two similarly sized and apparently separated hearts. The accumulation of study cases like this will help in the understanding of patterns and process behind this phenomena, and collection material plays a key role in this context.",

In this paper, the hypothesis that morphological adaptations related to granivory have evolved in these bats is investigated and discussed. A canonical variate analysis was used to search for possible divergent trends between the masticatory apparatus of Chiroderma and other stenodermatines currently recognized in the same ensemble. A total of 142 specimens representative of eight species was included in the analysis. Species of Chiroderma can be discriminated from all other species in the sample based on the increased development of masseter-related variables (height of the anterior zygomatic arch, masseter moment arm, and masseter volume), which, in conjunction with other morphological characteristics (dentition and gape angle) discussed herein, corroborates the evolution of durophagy in this group. A complementary analysis based on a Mantel test revealed that the pattern of morphological differentiation that emerged from the canonical variate analysis does not agree with the one expected based solely on the phylogenetic relationships adopted for the canopy fruit-bats studied here. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that morphological adaptations related to granivory have evolved in Chiroderma.",

            "abstractNote": "Cochlear morphology has been regarded as one of the key traits to understand the origin and evolution of echolocation in bats, given its functionality and performance for receiving echolocation sonar. While numerous researchers have compared adult-stage morphology, few have studied the prenatal development of the cochlea. Here, we provide the first detailed three-dimensional description of the prenatal cranial development in bats, using Rhinolophus thomasi as a model, with particular interest to the petrosal which houses the cochlea. Results revealed that among all cranial bones the onset of the ossification of the petrosal is earlier in R. thomasi when compared to other reported mammals. Generally, the cochlea reaches adult size and shape before or around birth in placental mammals including bats, but we found that its shape and size growths continue until maturity in Rhinolophus species. The relationship of cochlear size and skull size is maintained constant throughout the postnatal ontogeny to adulthood in Rhinolophus, a pattern previously reported neither in any other bats nor other mammals. The peculiar developmental pattern in Rhinolophus possibly allows them to form their characteristically large cochlea and facilitate their distinctive echolocation behavior. A recent study reported that non-echolocating Pteropodidae shares a similar prenatal cochlear size to laryngeal echolocating bats. The apparent resemblance of fetal cochlear size was proposed to be a vestigial signal of large cochlear size in the last common ancestor of bats and thus as supporting evidence for the single origin of laryngeal echolocation. However, results from the present observations suggest that limited aspects of the cochlear development were captured in this previous investigation and that the resulting interpretations may be questionable. We point out that diversity and patterns of cochlear development among bats are still not resolved, and the controversy on the origins of laryngeal echolocation is still open to discussion.",

This paper examines one of four methods that we have used to estimate the cost of ﬂight in a neotropical nectarfeeding bat Glossophaga soricina (Phyllostomidae), namely the use of kinematic and morphological data and aerodynamic theory to estimate the mechanical power requirements (power output) for hovering and horizontal forward ﬂight. A hot-wire anemometer was used to measure induced velocity (the velocity of air accelerated by the wings) during hovering in order to estimate induced power. Our estimate of aerodynamic power (the sum of induced, proﬁle and parasite powers) required for a 0.0105 kg G. soricina to hover is 0.15W and our estimate of the inertial power (the power required to oscillate the wings) is 0.19W. Thus, the total mechanical power for hovering is 0.34W or 32.4 W kgϪ1. The mechanical power required for horizontal forward ﬂight, near the minimum power ﬂight speed (4.2msϪ1) for a 0.0117kg bat is 0.14W (12.3W kgϪ1), of which 0.10W is aerodynamic power and 0.042W is inertial power. Comparison with our results on metabolic power requirements estimated from nectar intake gives a mechanical efficiency of 0.15 for hovering ﬂight and of 0.11 for forward ﬂight near the minimum power speed.",

Few studies of phenology exist for any hibernating species and those that do address species which mate during spring. We used passive transponders (PIT tags) to study hibernation phenology of little brown bats Myotis lucifugus, a species that mates prior to hibernation in the fall. We expected that adult females would emerge earliest as early parturition increases juvenile survival. We predicted that females with large fat stores should emerge earliest because of their ability to tolerate inclement spring weather at the maternity roost. We also predicted that adult males would remain active later than females to maximize mating opportunities and compensate for body mass decline during the mating period. We implanted 475 bats with PIT tags and remotely recorded immergence and emergence timing at a hibernaculum in central Canada. As expected, adult males were active signiﬁcantly later (median immergence date = 16 September 2011) than adult females (11 September 2011) and adult females emerged earlier (median emergence date = 6 May 2012) than both adult males (25 May 2012) and subadults (13 May 2012). Emergence timing was correlated with fall body condition in adult females, with fatter females emerging earlier, but not males. Our results highlight the importance of reproductive timing as an inﬂuence on hibernation phenology of mammals.",

Twenty-eight Neotropical species are currently recognized. In this study, we evaluate molecular and morphological variation in the M. keaysi complex, a high elevation clade of Neotropical myotine bats characterized by complex taxonomy and high morphological variation. A phylogeny inferred with cytochrome-b sequences recovered two clades composed of samples traditionally assigned to M. keaysi, with 9% of genetic divergence between them. These clades were also suggested as putative distinct species by molecular species delimitation methods. Qualitative and quantitative morphological analyses indicated a phenotypic discontinuity between specimens from central Andes (including the holotype of M. keaysi) and western lowlands of Ecuador, showing strong congruence between molecular and morphological approaches. We therefore describe a new species for the Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena region, documenting their external and cranial diagnostic characters by comparing them with other Neotropical species. In addition, we provide an emended diagnosis for our new concept of M. keaysi.",

We conducted an integrative study using mitochondrial DNA, qualitative and quantitative morphology, and current and past species distribution models to investigate the variation, population structure, and distributional limits within M. riparius populations. Phylogenetic inferences indicated that M. riparius is monophyletic, and populations are divided into geographically structured clades that split during the middle Pleistocene. There is no shared haplotype between geographical populations and strong evidence of partial restriction in gene flow. Morphological and morphometric variations revealed subtle distinctions among different populations, but little correspondence with molecular analysis. The distribution models indicated that M. riparius is associated with forest environments, with discontinuity between populations from South American ecoregions. Past distribution modelling, however, indicated that M. riparius had a larger distribution range in the Last Glacial Maximum than currently. Results of modelling and genetic analyses indicated that M. riparius consisted of a large, widespread, and panmictic (meta)population until the middle Pleistocene, when environmental changes driven by climatic dynamics fragmented and isolated the populations. Myotis riparius is here considered a complex of at least four allopatric and parapatric cryptic evolutionary units.",

Individuals of midge cultures reared in 10 different laboratories showed a clear reduction in the number of alleles per locus and in the level of heterozygosity compared to two natural populations sampled in southern Germany. To reconstruct the rate of genetic impoverishment under laboratory conditions, genetic diversity was monitored in a C. riparius laboratory population for 23 generations. Additionally, 11 populations originating from different laboratories were crossed, and genetic diversity was compared among pure, crossed, and natural populations. The results demonstrate that C. riparius strains used in standard toxicity tests exhibit low levels of genetic variability. In addition, our experiments show that refreshment of stocks with individuals from other laboratories is not sufﬁcient to restore genetic variation. Potential consequences of genetic impoverishment and improvements for toxicological bioassays are discussed.",

However, the species still faces serious extinction risk. To aid in the strategic planning and priorities for conservation, we studied roosting ecology. These bats inhabit the Chihuahuan Desert in one of the smallest distributional ranges of any mammal. Using radiotelemetry, we located 25 summer roosts, all in the skirts of dry leaves of yucca trees (Yucca carnerosana). We conclude that to roost, these bats search for clumps of tall yucca trees with a mean height of 3.93 m and mean width of skirts of 1.35 m.",

Composition of 95 communal groups was sampled and spatial distribution of individually marked bats investigated. Individual C. tuberculatus moved to new roost sites virtually every day. Long term non-random associations among individuals were found by a cluster analysis that revealed three distinct social groups. Groups contained on average 72.0 (± 26.0) (mean ± SD), 99.3 (± 19.0) and 131.7 (± 16.5) marked individuals/year. Collective foraging ranges of the three groups overlapped but roosting occurred in three geographically distinct adjacent areas. Only 1.6% of individuals switched between groups. Non-reproductive females and males switched between groups more often than reproductive females but individuals switched only once or twice during the study and then just for one night. Juveniles of both sexes were associated with their natal group as 1 year-olds and then later when breeding. Social groups were cryptic because foraging ranges of groups overlapped, bats belonging to each group spread over many roosts each day, and these roost sites changed from day to day. Bats moved infrequently between groups, potentially linking the local population assemblages. Future research should explore whether the population is structured in demes. Population structure did not conform to traditional metapopulation models because groups occurred in homogeneous habitat extending over a large geographical area. Conserving bat populations should entail preserving a representative number of subgroups but development of models for predicting minimum number of effective local populations is still required.",

            "abstractNote": "Fifty radio-tagged long-tailed bats Chalinolobus tuberculatus, belonging to three social groups numbering on average 72±132 bats each, ranged over an area of 11 700 ha in Nothofagus rainforest in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, New Zealand, during the austral summers of 1993±96. Bats were followed for 12.7  6.3 (s d) days. Home-range sizes were among the largest published for Microchiroptera. Median minimum convex polygons (100% MCPs) for adult males were 1589 ha (max = 5629 ha), 1361 ha for post-lactating females, and 657 ha for non-reproductive females. Ranges of lactating females (median = 330 ha), were signi®cantly smaller. Juveniles that were volant for < 2 weeks had the smallest ranges (median = 237 ha) but movements increased signi®cantly after c. 2 weeks to a median of 2006 ha. Movements were frequent and rapid within the range (790  471 s d m/15 min) and average range lengths were 3.3±10.9 km (max = 19 km). Despite their large home ranges, bats concentrated their activity (85% of ®xes) in small core areas that represented a mean of 5.7  1.5% (s d) of the 100% MCPs. Ranges of roosting sites were also small, averaging 9.4  1.8% (s d) of total range size. Bats followed similar movement patterns each night but core areas only overlapped by 43  14% (s d) from one night to the next. Moderately low levels of overlap of home ranges (31±68%) and of core areas (23±56%) among individuals of the same reproductive class suggest a degree of spatial segregation among bats from the same roosting group. A prediction that C. tuberculatus has large ranges to minimize overlap between foraging bats, re¯ecting scarcity of food, requires testing. Range sizes were probably underestimates of seasonal, annual, and life-time range requirements. Nevertheless, large range size and the degree of individual spacing implies that conservation areas designed for bats should be large and that protection of roosting areas alone would not be suf®cient to protect bat populations.",

            "abstractNote": "There are currently six species of Micronycteris (sensu stricto) recognized in Venezuela, of which three have pale venters: M. homezi, M. minuta and M. schmidtorum. Since the original description of M. homezi as a subspecies of M. megalotis (based on the presence of a cutaneous fossa in the interauricular region), this taxon has not appeared in checklists for Venezuelan mammal inventories due to confusion and uncertainty related to the original description. However, it was recently reconsidered as a valid taxon on the basis of an additional series of males collected in French Guiana, Guyana, and Brazil. The examination of a larger number of specimens of Micronycteris collected in Venezuela (73 of them within the pale venter group), allows us to reject the cutaneous fossa as a valid character to diagnose M. homezi, suggesting that the name homezi represents a junior synonym of M. minuta. Among the arguments supporting this statement are: 1) the discovery of a cutaneous fossa in two congeneric forms (M. megalotis and M. microtis); 2) the existence of histological evidence verifying the presence of this structure (incipiently developed) in specimens assignable to M. minuta; 3) the development of the fossa only in adult males (associated with a hypertrophy of the interauricular band); and 4) the similarity, in both chromatic and morphological features of Venezuelan specimens assignable to either M. minuta or M. homezi. The presence of a developed cutaneous fossa only in some adult males, as well as its correlation with the growth of the interauricular band and the modification of histological components could be the result of hormonal effects influenced by social rank or reproductive condition. Both structures are elements of a coordinated system, whereby the interauricular band is responsible for the production of sebaceous substances associated with the cutaneous fossa.",

A loss of c. , individuals has been reported and the species is now categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List. However, until now there were no robust data available on damage to orchards caused by bats. During October –February  we monitored four major lychee Litchi chinensis and one mango (Mangifera spp.) orchard, and also assessed  individual longan Dimocarpus longan trees. Bats and introduced birds caused major damage to fruit, with –% fruit loss (including natural fall and losses from fungal damage) per tree. Bats caused more damage to taller lychee trees (.  m high) than to smaller ones, whereas bird damage was independent of tree height. Bats damaged more fruit than birds in tall lychee trees, although this trend was reversed in small trees. Use of nets on fruiting trees can result in as much as a -fold reduction in the damage caused by bats if nets are applied correctly. There is still a need to monitor orchards over several seasons and to test non-lethal bat deterrence methods more widely.",

            "abstractNote": "We captured and sampled 68 bats of six species from a shared roosting site in Puerto Rico in April 2012. Bats were screened for Bartonella spp. by culture and confirmed by PCR and sequencing for the gltA gene. Bartonella cultures were obtained from blood specimens of 9/51 (18%) individuals from three species (Artibeus jamaicensis, Brachyphylla cavernarum, and Monophyllus redmani). Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA sequences showed that M. redmani was infected with multiple, diverse Bartonella strains, and A. jamaicensis was infected with a strain related to a strain from a congeneric host. Ectoparasite load could possibly explain observed differences in Bartonella diversity and prevalence between bat species in this community, and we suggest future research to substantiate these preliminary findings.",

            "abstractNote": "Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a brain region involved in critical cognitive functions including memory, planning, and spatial navigation and is commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Subregions of RSC are typically described as Brodmann areas 29 and 30, which are defined by cytoarchitectural features. Using immunofluorescence, we studied the distributions of neurons immunoreactive for NeuN, latexin, and calcium binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) in RSC of Carollia perspicillata, Seba's short-tailed fruit bat. We observed that latexin was specifically present in areas 29a and 29b but not 29c and 30. We further identified distribution patterns of calcium binding proteins that group areas 29a and 29b separately from areas 29c and 30. We conclude first that latexin is a useful marker to classify subregions of RSC and second that these subregions contain distinct patterns of neuronal immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Given the long lifespan of Carollia, bat RSC may be a useful model in studying age-related neurodegeneration.",
