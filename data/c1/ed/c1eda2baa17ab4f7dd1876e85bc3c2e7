We examine the predation of bats by cats at Culebrones cave, Puerto Rico, West Indies. Culebrones cave is a hot cave located in the karst region of northern Puerto Rico. The temperature gradient inside the cave sustains a multi-species assemblage of bats consisting of approximately 300,000 individuals of six species, namely: Brachyphylla cavernarum, Erophylla bombifrons, Monophyllus redmani, Mormoops blainvillei, Pteronotus quadridens and Pteronotus parnellii. Even though rats are often their primary prey, cats will use alternative prey, which enables them to maintain their abundance when one prey is not available. In Puerto Rico, birds and reptiles are known to be preyed upon by cats. Although cats are commonly observed in or around bat caves in Puerto Rico, this is the first systematic attempt to evaluate their role as bat predators. We made observations of the hunting strategy of cats using an infrared camera and recorded the number of wings left as remains of these hunting bouts. Wings were identified to species. Cat scats were also recovered and examined to identify prey species. Our results suggest that captures of different species of bats is not a function of their abundance in the cave. While M. blainvillei (11 g) and P. quadridens (5 g) are the most abundant species in the cave, B. cavernarum (50 g) and M. redmani (11 g) are captured in greater numbers by the cats.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging disease causing massive mortality of hibernating bats in the northeastern United States. At hibernacula, bats affected with WNS typically exhibit growth of a white psychrophylic fungus (Geomyces destructans) on the nose, wings and ears; many individuals seem to prematurely die of starvation owing to depleted fat reserves. Conspicuous scarring and necrosis of the wings on WNS-affected bats that survive hibernation may have lasting consequences for survival and reproductive success during the active season. We monitored two maternity colonies of little brown myotis, Myotis lucifugus, in Massachusetts and New Hampshire from 14 May to 8 August 2008 to assess body conditions after expected exposure to WNS over the previous winter. We developed a 4-point wing damage index (WDI = 0 to 3) to assess the incidence and severity of wing damage in the months following emergence from hibernation. Severe wing damage was observed up to 4 June and moderate damage was observed through 9 July. Light wing damage was observed on both adult and juvenile bats throughout the study period, but was not exclusively attributed to WNS. The most severe wing damage was associated with a lower body mass index which may reflect reduced foraging success. Overall, reproductive rate was 85.1% in 2008; slightly lower than reported in previous studies. The incidence, timing, and geographic range of wing damage observed on little brown myotis in 2008 correspond to the occurrence of WNS at hibernacula. Monitoring wing conditions of affected and healthy bats will be important tool for assessing the spread of this disease and for establishing baseline data for unaffected bats. The simple scale we propose should be useful for monitoring wing conditions in any bat species.",

Five external, 10 cranial, and eight dental measurements of animals from different Malagasy populations (grouped according to bioclimatic regions) show differences in the degree of sexual dimorphism and size variation. Further, the population on Mayotte is largely identical in size to those from western Madagascar, and animals from Pemba are notably larger than those from Madagascar and Mayotte. Cytochrome b genetic distances across samples from these islands were low (maximum 0.0035) and animals from Pemba and Mayotte shared cytochrome b haplotypes with Malagasy bats. D-loop data showed some concordance between haplotype distribution, geographical position (latitude and island), and the bioclimatic zones. Animals from Pemba and Mayotte formed a unique D-loop haplotype, which was a minimum of six mutational steps different from Malagasy haplotypes. Within Madagascar, certain haplotypes were exclusive to the north (13ºS latitude band) and arid southwest (22º and 23ºS latitudes) regions. In general, there was no clear concordance between variation in haplotype distribution, latitude, altitude or gender. Where concordance occurred, the genetic distances involved were not sufficiently high to warrant the definition of new taxonomic units. Hence, based on current genetic information, patterns of morphological variation of the Madagascar populations and differences between Pemba and Mayotte/Madagascar are best explained as inter-population variation and may be adaptive, associated with different climatic regimes and associated ecological variables.",

Mitochondrial DNA tRNA-proline and control region sequences were used for the analyses. As a result of the phylogenetic analyses, two reciprocally monophyletic clades were found with very high support. The results suggested that secondary contact after allopatric differentiation in separate glacial refugia, and subsequent range expansion was the best explanation regarding the evolutionary history of this species in the region. The geographical distribution of the haplotypes also suggested that the Balkans and the Black Sea could be representing refugia from which the region was populated. There also was evidence for population expansion following a pattern of isolation by distance, with geographically more distant samples also being genetically more differentiated.",

Four species were caught in relatively intact humid forest (Myotis goudoti, Miniopterus manavi, Miniopterus majori and Emballonura atrata) two in agricultural land, Neoromicia matroka and Neoromicia melckorum, and one, Rousettus madagascariensis, in Eucalyptus plantations. Mormopterus jugularis, Chaerephon pumilus and Mops leucostigma were found roosting in buildings ca. three km from the humid forest. Acoustic sampling revealed that Neoromicia spp. and molossids were ubiquitous and were recorded from intact and degraded humid forest, Eucalyptus plantations and agricultural land. Myotis goudoti showed the strongest association with intact humid forest. Taxon richness, determined by acoustic sampling, was highest in humid forest but activity was highest in plantations and agricultural land. Mixed-habitat landscapes that surround protected forests and consist of a mosaic of regenerating forest, agriculture, wetlands, villages and plantations are important for bats and promote chiropteran diversity because they provide roosting and foraging sites for species that rarely use intact forest. The humid forests of eastern Madagascar have lower bat diversity than the island's western deciduous karst forests.",

Adult bats were captured at different localities across the island, measured, and their echolocation calls recorded. On average, male T. auritus and T. furculus have shorter forearms (47.0 and 44.0 mm, respectively) and emit higher frequency calls (107.8 and 113.1 kHz, respectively) than females (47.5 and 45.7 mm and 95.6 and 98.2 kHz, respectively), representing a form of reversed sexual dimorphism (females larger than males). However, T. menamena shows typical patterns of sexual size dimorphism with males having a longer forearm (51.7 mm) and lower frequency echolocation calls (82.3 kHz) than females (49.0 mm and 93.5 kHz, respectively). When segregated by sex, there was a strong allometric relationship between forearm length, used as a measure of body size, and the resting frequency in these three species, as well as two African hipposiderids (T. afer and Cloeotis percivali). Triaenops auritus males and both sexes of T. furculus deviated from the relationship between these two variables. Hypotheses are explored to explain the drivers of these sexual dimorphism patterns. On the basis of the allometric relationship, the strong correlation is in parallel to other groups of bats and is probably associated with ecological constraints. Recent phylogenetic analyses showed a separation of Afro-Malagasy Triaenops into two sister clades: T. auritus/T. furculus (suggested to be placed in a new genus, Paratriaenops) and T. menamena/T. afer. The patterns of sexual dimorphism in these taxa are congruent with clade membership. Further studies are needed to understand strategies used by these taxa when in sympatry to share habitat and ecological niches.",

            "abstractNote": "For bats that are year-round residents of temperate areas, underground openings such as caves and abandoned mines are critical resources in winter as hibernacula, and in autumn for swarming behaviours (mating, socialization, etc.). Like many parts of the world, Nova Scotia, Canada, has many underground openings that have not been surveyed for bats. The feature(s) that affect the suitability of these sites for hibernation or swarming is not known. As such, it is not possible to predict which ones are used by local bats (Myotis lucifugus, Myotis septentrionalis and Perimyotis subflavus). Because it was not safe to enter the sites to conduct hibernation counts, our goal was to relate bat activity at the entrance of underground openings during swarming to quantifiable external metrics and to pre-existing data on internal site characteristics. Specifically, our objectives were to 1) identify abandoned mines and caves that are used by bats for swarming and 2) quantitatively characterize factors which best differentiate between underground openings that are used for swarming, and those that are not. We assumed that sites used by bats for swarming were likely also used for hibernation. Acoustic and/or trapping surveys were conducted at 17 abandoned mines and eight caves in Nova Scotia, five of which were previously known to be hibernacula. Results suggest that at least 12 of the 25 sites were swarming sites (including seven newly identified sites). Logistic regression analysis of nine a priori selected models indicated that internal chamber length was the best predictor of swarming activity. Two external variables, degree of shelter at entrance and total length of rivers in landscape, were also important predictors. These variables have the potential to be used as indicators to identify swarming sites at other sites in eastern North America. The swarming sites identified in Nova Scotia should be targeted for monitoring in light of the devastating impacts that white-nose syndrome is having on North American bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Preservation of foraging habitats is a fundamental approach to bat conservation. Yet, knowledge on the primary foraging sites of Mediterranean bats remains scarce, particularly during the summer when the availability of prey can be limiting. This study was designed to determine in which habitats bats forage in Southern Portugal, during this potentially stressful period. During the summers of 1994 and 1995, bat foraging activity was monitored in representative habitat types using an ultra-sound detector. The number of feeding-buzzes and batpasses were counted and species identified through the analysis of recorded echolocation calls. None of the recorded species restricted its foraging activity to a single habitat type, but water sites were preferred by most bats. Tadarida teniotis was an exception to this habitat use. Further analysis confirmed that riparian habitats when surrounded by autochthonous broad-leaved forests seem to provide optimal foraging areas for bats during summer. Opposite, water sites within habitats resulting from intensive agriculture or forestry, provide very poor foraging areas. The typical Mediterranean landscape of Iberia, dominated by oak-woodlands and with numerous, scattered and well vegetated water sites, seems to grant optimal foraging habitat for bats during summer. However, this landscape is itself at risk. Current production demands are causing substantial land-use changes and, despite some European programmes on the preservation of Mediterranean oak woodlands and their biodiversity, the furtherance of this landscape is at stake. The preservation of traditional management strategies of oak-woodlands and associated water sites should be strongly encouraged.",

Four out of eight young (Group 1) at 60–63 days of age began to capture freshly killed frogs we pulled with a long thread on the sandy floor of flight room. However, the mothers continued to suckle until their young became 84.7 ± 3.97 (0 ± SE) days of age. When the remaining four young (Group 2) were 59.5 ± 1.85 days of age their mothers stopped suckling. Nevertheless, these mothers transferred either entire or partly consumed frogs (bodies with no heads, half bodies, paired hind limbs, and single hind limbs) to their young solicitors. Such food transfers occurred based on the body lengths of frogs. Mothers transferred small frogs entirely, but as the body length of frogs increased, mothers transferred smaller body parts to their young. Audible vocalizations of mothers and young were associated with food transfers. When these young bats became 74.0 ± 2.63 days of age, their mothers stopped food transfers. It appears that lactating females of M. lyra provision offspring by supplementing milk with solid food, similar to what has been observed in other megadermatid bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Temperate bats make extensive use of caves and mines as nursery roosts, swarming sites and hibernacula. For a variety of reasons, the entrances to many sites have been modified in the past to restrict human access. Early barrier design often gave little regard to bats, leading to massive population declines in many nursery and hibernation sites. Free access to bats has become an increasingly important design feature, as the damaging effects of early gates were recognised. However, given the large number of gates that have been constructed, relatively few studies have looked at either the short or long-term effects of gates on bat behaviour and population sizes. Even fewer studies have examined specifically the effects of different gate designs. We have looked at the immediate effects of gates on the behaviour of swarming bats as they entered a natural cave. Three gates were tested, all with vertical grille spacings of 750 mm, but with horizontal spacings of 150, 130 or 100 mm. The gate with 150 mm spacings had no significant effect on the behaviour of the bats (predominantly Myotis nattereri). Gates with both 130 mm and 100 mm spacing caused a significant and substantial increase in the number of bats aborting their first and often subsequent attempts to enter the cave. The consequences to swarming behaviour and long-term use of the site by bats are unknown, but we suggest that following the precautionary principle, the minimum spacing between horizontal bars in gates should be 150 mm.",

Samples, for which mtDNA amplification was successful, were subject to the multiplex amplification of eight microsatellite loci. This resulted in > 95% amplification success over 12,592 PCRs. Allelic dropout (ADO) and false allele (FA) rates were low, and consequently, sample and locus quality indexes (QI) were high. These results demonstrate that large scale noninvasive studies of bat colonies are possible.",

If precautions are not taken, the spread of G. destructans by human transportation for scientific study may be a substantial threat to bat populations. We investigated the viability of G. destructans after being exposed to commonly used DNA/RNA preservation methods. Our first experiment revealed that G. destructans is able to germinate after an eight day storage period in RNAlater or kept dry but could not germinate after storage in 70% or absolute ethanol for the same time period. Storing G. destructans samples at different temperatures did not substantially affect the results. In a second experiment, we showed that G. destructans conidia were only killed after being stored in 70% ethanol for a minimum of 24 hours while only 30 minutes were necessary when stored in absolute ethanol. Our results suggest that the DNA/RNA preservation method has an important impact on the ability of G. destructans to remain viable and should therefore be considered before samples are transported, especially to regions where the fungus has not yet been documented. Our results also strongly advocate the use of high concentrations (i.e., absolute) ethanol over 70% ethanol to rapidly kill G. destructans.",

            "abstractNote": "Although closely related host species are similarly susceptible to infestations of parasites, even small differences in their morphology, feeding behaviour or population history may affect parasitic infestation. In the present study we analyse the abundance of two species of nycteribiid flies (Diptera, Nycteribiidae) and one wing mite (Mesostigmata: Spinturnicidae) infesting populations of Miniopterus schreibersii and M. pallidius, which comprise a cryptic species complex of Miniopterus species in Asia Minor. We focus on the putative contact zone between these two taxa in Central Anatolia. We conducted our study in seven caves with large (≥ 1,000 individuals) maternity aggregations: three housing Anatolian M. schreibersii, one housing Levantine M. schreibersii, and three housing Anatolian M. pallidus. Sex-biased parasitism was found only twice: female-biased in Spinturnix psi on M. pallidus, and male-biased in Nycteribia schmidlii on M. schreibersii. Differences in the flies’ abundance between Anatolian M. schreibersii and M. pallidius were found only in N. schmidlii (for female host), but not for Penicilidia dufourii. There was a significant difference in the wing mite abundance, both between hosts and sexes. Unexpectedly, we observed a large difference in the load and type of parasites between M. schreibersii from Levant (separated from other M. schreibersii colonies by a few colonies of M. pallidus) and the rest of M. schreibersii. In Levant, the wing mites did not infest bats. Instead, they carried almost threefold larger load of the flies than in other bent-wing bat colonies. It is possible that the decline of wing mites is associated with increasing quantities of flies. One hypothesis regarding the absence of S. psi in the Levant colony, is that it is correlated with a significant decrease in the size of the bat’s population in the past (as indicated by both mtDNA and microsatellite studies) and their disconnection from the continuous range of other M. schreibersii. We did not find any correlation between parasite load and health status of the host.",

A total of 6,175 bats of 19 species was captured, and over 70,000 passes through cave openings were registered. Caves differed in bat species richness, sex ratio, abundance of particular species and species composition. Peak species richness was observed in the mid-elevation cave. Bat activity was high in all caves, but declined with increasing altitude. Swarming activity occurred earlier at high elevation than at lower elevations. Activity of boreal-alpine species, such as Eptesicus nilssonii, peaked at the start of the swarming period, that of species typical of lower elevations, such as Myotis emarginatus, peaked in the middle of the swarming season. In a few species, males showed a significant preference for higher altitude caves, in contrast to females. A similar pattern was observed in the proportion of adults to juveniles, which increased with increasing elevation. Our results also suggest that M. brandtii and M. alcathoe were more often encountered at lower elevations, M. mystacinus (sensu stricto) at higher ones.",

A total 5,608 bats representing 11 of Poland’s 25 species were captured. Myotis mystacinus predominated. Its activity at all times was high. However, the species composition and number of other bats changed seasonally. Swarming activity lasted between July and November, peaking in late July and August. Nightly activity peaked between 22.00 and 02.00 hrs and then gradually decreased toward dawn. Strong male bias was observed. Myotis mystacinus showed regular changes in sex and age ratios. Rare species such as M. bechsteinii, M. emarginatus, and Vespertilio murinus were recorded. This cave is the highest locality of M. bechsteinii and M. brandtii in Europe. Some behavioural observations including copulation, drinking and daylight activity were recorded. The role of swarming activity is discussed in light of the findings. Some observations suggest that this activity of bats is connected with mating; some other observations provide evidence that the function of swarming is also to facilitate the location of mates and/or to assess suitable hibernacula.",

The calls of 12 species of the family Phyllostomidae are described here for the first time and a total of 29 species, belonging to five families (Emballonuridae, Mormoopidae, Phyllostomidae, Molossidae and Vespertilionidae) were recorded. Quadratic discriminant function analysis (DFA) was used to obtain classification rates for each one of 11 individual species and for six guilds (based on diet, foraging mode and habitat) comprising 26 species. Overall classification rates were low compared to similar studies conducted in the Palaeotropics. We suggest that this may be due to a combination of ecological plasticity for certain species and a loose relationship between echolocation call shape, fine-grained resource partitioning and resource acquisition in phyllostomids.",

Using 1) ecological niche modeling with maximum entropy (Maxent), 2) relative abundance estimates using museum records, and 3) field surveys of roosting sites, we report the fraternal fruit-eating bat, Artibeus fraterculus, as having a distribution limited to the Tumbesian ecoregion in Ecuador and west central Peru, being the relatively most abundant bat species throughout its range, with healthy populations which are primarily sustained by cultivated and introduced plants, and using human-made constructions as roost sites. Additionally, we described a large congregation of individuals of this species in a single roost, representing the largest colony reported for the genus Artibeus. These results may indicate resilience of A. fraterculus to human disturbance.",

We also report the second known specimen of Eumops underwoodi from Costa Rica and additional specimens of Cynomops mexicanus, Eumops glaucinus, Molossus molossus, and Molossus pretiosus. Most of the females captured in August and April were either lactating or pregnant, suggesting that parturition in these molossids occurs in the late dry season and the early to middle rainy season, periods when insects are especially abundant in this dry forest. Characters used previously to distinguish between the similarsized E. hansae and E. nanus are evaluated, and external and cranial measurements for the specimens of E. hansae are provided. The best single character for distinguishing the two species is size and shape of the upper incisors. In E. hansae, the upper incisors are thin and recurved, whereas they are thick, straight, and slightly procumbent in E. nanus. The six sympatric species of free-tailed bat found in the gallery forest along the Río Enmedio vary in size, jaw thickness, and wing shape suggesting coexistence through resource partitioning in this molossid bat assemblage.",

We quantified body composition (total carcass lipids) to determine if morphological indices were useful predictors of body condition in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). We also evaluated body composition indirectly by TOBEC using EM-SCAN® technology. The most important predictors of body composition in multiple regression analysis were body mass-to-forearm ratio (partial r2 = 0.82, P < 0.001) followed by TOBEC measurement (partial r2 = 0.08, P < 0.001) and to a minor extent head length (partial r2 = 0.02, P < 0.05). Morphological condition indices alone may be adequate for some studies because of lower cost and effort. Marking bats with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags affected TOBEC measurements.",

Early emergence increases the risk of exposure to raptorial birds, but emerging late confers a risk of missing the dusk peak of aerial insects. Here, both emergence and return activity was studied in detail at the same roosts for the first time. We investigated six maternity colonies of pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus) in NE Scotland and recorded light levels and time of emergence and return of the bats with respect to sunset and sunrise on the same nights. Parameters of return activity generally occurred at lower light intensities than those of emergence. Therefore, the interval between dawn return and sunrise was generally longer than that between sunset and dusk emergence. Emergence and return were equal in duration. Bats clustered more on emergence in comparison with return during pregnancy and lactation, whereas during postlactation this trend was reversed.",

In total 12 species have been positively identified, while a considerable proportion of all records are sightings of unidentified bats. Eight of the species are European in origin and four originate from the New World. The largest number of species (8) has been recorded in Iceland, but the greatest number of individuals (180) has been found in Orkney. The bat invasion on the Faroe Islands in 2010 is without precedence, when 70 observations of a minimum of 45 individuals were noted. Most bat observations in the study area occurred in the autumn, with fewer in the spring. Most observations were of single animals, but there were also sightings of up to 12 individuals. There has been a marked increase in bat records in the past three decades. We discuss whether this is a real increase, or due to improved communications, increased public awareness, increased shipping, changes in weather patterns and/or the effects of climate change. All factors appear to be involved.",

Overall bat activity was noticeably greater along adult pine plantation edges, local human settlements and the edge of continuous forest than over interior habitats and unplanted forest plantation clear-cuts. Tadarida brasiliensis foraged mostly above human settlements and edges of adult pine plantations but avoided interior habitats. Lasiurus cinereus was more active along edges of both adult pine plantations and continuous forest than in clearcuts and interior habitats of forest fragments. In contrast, Lasiurus varius, Histiotus montanus and Myotis chiloensis occurred not only along vegetation edges but also within the interior habitats of adult pine plantations. The high activity levels suggest that bats not only pass through exotic pine plantations, but that they are active in these habitats commuting and feeding, thus enhancing their capacity to persist in landscapes modified by humans in which exotic forestry plantations are an important component.",

We examine the distribution of these two flying-fox species and report on the first flyingfox camp (day roost) with all four species of Australian mainland Pteropus co-occurring. Climatic models were developed from previous records to determine if the location of this new camp is climatically suitable for these species. We found that this location is climatically suitable to some degree for both P. conspicillatus and P. poliocephalus but that the latter had a higher climatic suitability at this site. Historical records exist for P. poliocephalus close to this location but not for P. conspicillatus. The location of this mixed-species flying-fox camp is the most southerly distribution for P. conspicillatus, being 500 km further south than previous records. This area of overlap creates potential opportunities for interbreeding between P. conspicillatus and P. poliocephalus. Therefore, monitoring of this region for the location of further mixed-species camps and the degree of panmixia at those locations is highly desirable.",

Survey and monitoring of bats for conservation are severely hampered by the lack of a reliable and user-friendly method of identifying bats from their echolocation calls. We recorded and described time-expanded echolocation calls from 23 bat species in the National Park of Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli, Greece. We compared the performance of quadratic and linear discriminant function analysis (DFA) of calls as a means of identifying species. Quadratic rather than linear DFA has been used by several researchers because of the violation of the method’s basic assumption (homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices). However, when linear DFA was applied for the classification of recorded species in this study, correct classification rate was identical to the quadratic functions (82.4%) and linear models did not misclassify bats to the species with the greatest dispersion, the main problem caused by violation of the homogeneity assumption. The advantage of linear DFA is that it provides discriminant function coefficients. The linear combination of these coefficients and parameters from calls from unidentified bats can be used for species identification without access to the original data sets, an option not provided by quadratic analysis. When separate models were developed for Myotis species and for FM/QCF species, correct classification rates increased to 84.8% and 93.4%, respectively. DF coefficients thus provide a reliable identification tool, but intraspecific geographic variation must be taken into account.",

            "abstractNote": "The molecular identification of prey in faeces is an efficient non-invasive technique to study diet which requires both a satisfactory method of DNA extraction and the design of specific primers to selectively amplify prey’s DNA. In this study we evaluated and compared the efficiency of two total DNA extraction methods and five primer pairs for the molecular identification of birds from scats, in particular from the giant noctule bat (Nyctalus lasiopterus). A modified DNA stool Mini Kit of Qiagen was tested against a modified silica method with a guanidinium thiocianate (GuSCN) applied after freezing and pulverizing the samples. We also checked two published vertebrate- and bird-generalist primer pairs and three bird-specific primer pairs designed by us (two pairs targeting the cytochrome b and one the cytochrome oxidase subunit I genes) that amplified shorter DNA fragments. The results show that pulverizing the scat remains before extraction was a very important step, presumably facilitating access to the well preserved DNA located inside the rachis of the feathers. The combination of our bird-specific designed primers showed a higher amplification rate than the generalist primers and allowed successful bird identification from the feathers excreted by the giant noctule bat in all the scat samples analyzed, independent of the preservation method used (dried and frozen). These methodological improvements will allow not only the study of the avian diet composition of the enigmatic giant noctule, but the extension of this methodology to other bird predators such as raptors.",

These document the first confirmed records for the department of Tumbes. All, except E. hartii and N. leporinus, are also first records for the western slope of Peru. The record of R. io is the first for Peru, while that of C. auritus is the first for the Pacific versant of the Andes. In total, 41 bat species are present in the Pacific Tropical rainforests and surrounding dry forests, at the new Parque Nacional Cerros de Amotape, in Tumbes. This region requires urgent conservation programs, because the Pacific Tropical rainforest is threatened by human settlement, and resource exploitation in spite of its protected status.",

            "abstractNote": "The Bonin flying fox (Pteropus pselaphon) is endemic to the Ogasawara Islands, a collection of small oceanic islands in the Pacific Ocean. It inhabits only five islands: Chichi-jima, Haha-jima, Kita-iwo, Iwo, and Minami-iwo (arranged from north to south). Hahajima and Kita-iwo, the most widely spaced islands, are separated by a distance of about 160 km. The islands have different histories in the modern era with respect to human activity. At present, P. pselaphon population sizes exceed 100 on Chichi-jima and Minamiiwo, but the species is rare on the other three islands. Loss of genetic diversity is of concern because of the small population sizes. We obtained samples from three of the five islands — Chichi-jima, Kita-iwo, and Minami-iwo — and investigated species genetic diversity and genetic structure based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and microsatellite markers. Different mtDNA haplotypes were found in each island population. Based on the mtDNA sequence data, P. pselaphon displayed a cryptic genealogy, as haplotypes on each island did not cluster together. The microsatellite marker data, however, revealed a clear genetic structure among the island populations, suggesting the absence of recent inter-island gene flow. Based on these results, we propose that the individual island populations are not evolutionarily significant units, but should be conserved collectively as a single management unit.",

For two consecutive years, we analyzed the non-random associations among female bats and their interactions with other members of the harem. Female members occupying the edges of the harems came from different parts of the cave and were more frequently expelled from the roosting site. Females from the central core of the harem were attacked less often and received more affiliative interactions. Females occupying areas between the central core and the edges were the most active in repelling arriving females and were responsible for grooming the central core females. During the breeding season, aggressive activities decreased and females became more tolerant, which suggests that a potential benefit of roosting together is that it provides for a more suitable place to nurse newborns, because all females produce a better environment, in thermoregulatory ways.",

Nevertheless, transmission from bats to humans is so rare that only 27 of 50 states have reported a single case since record keeping began in the 1940s, and fewer than 0.78 persons/year have been infected. We here analyze human rabies exposure records from the Pennsylvania Department of Health to document relative risks in one representative state. Rabies exposure from bats to humans was no more frequent than from dogs and significantly less than from cats. Yet, of these three, only bats are listed as high-risk vectors. Furthermore, we found that 85.4% of rabies diagnosed from bats was confined to just one of the state’s 11 species. These findings suggest that disproportionate emphasis on bats, combined with lumping all bat species into a single risk category, is counterproductive to public health interests, in addition to needlessly prejudicing the public against these highly beneficial, but declining animals.",

            "abstractNote": "Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii) is a European species, restricted to woodlands with preference for mature deciduous forests in lowlands. It is considered rare throughout its range, although it may be common in optimal habitats. Roosts play crucial roles in the ecology of bats, and survival is partially dependant on the extent to which roosts protect bats from environmental extremes and predators. Roost selection is especially important for reproductive females, due to the higher energetic demands imposed by reproduction so understanding roost selection by maternity colonies is important for conservation. We investigated maternity roost selection by M. bechsteinii in southwestern Spain as a hierarchical process that proceeds from broad landscape scales to fine-scale local habitat characteristics. Radio-tracking of 28 lactating females allowed location and census of 13 maternity roost sites. Roosts were characterised at four detail scales (cavity, tree, stand, and landscape). All the roosts occurred in Quercus pyrenaica trees, within stands of the same species of very diverse structure. Ten of the roosts were former woodpecker holes, among which seven had their entrance modified by nuthatch. Roosts were located inside the forest and close (< 620 m) to permanent water sources. Roost trees were characterised by a higher proportion of dead branches. Other explored variables such as tree height, orientation, foliar cover, and elevation did not explain distribution of roosts at any scale. The species’ breeding roost selection is described for the first time in a Mediterranean area.",

The Orii’s flying-fox is a generalist forager that feeds on 78 plant species from 62 genera and 43 families. They consume fruits of 53 species, flowers of 20 species, and leaves of 18 species. Cultivated or naturalized plants composed almost half of the diet. Diversity in the diet may be an adaptation to unstable food conditions on this small subtropical island. The number of individual Orii’s flyingfoxes fluctuated greatly corresponding to monthly changes in food availability, especially that of Ficus microcarpa, which was the animal’s main food resource throughout the year. Orii’s flying-foxes may adapt to an urban environment by intensively using areas with abundant planted trees.",

Here we describe the first records of this species from Germany, Poland, Albania, and from the European part of Turkey, including the northernmost locality in central Germany (51°23’N, 11°01’E). Compilation of all up-to-date records shows that M. alcathoe has a wide European distribution although it seems to be rare at most places. The habitats where the bat was recorded are natural, moist and deciduous forests with old trees and water streams as can be found, for example, in canyons or forests of alluvial origin. Such habitats suggest that the species probably has a more continuous and wider distribution than currently known and might be expected to occur even further to the North.",

The flowers are white, tiny and in dense fascicles. The foraging activities of the two bat species were segregated in space and time. Cynopterus sphinx fed on resources at lower heights in the trees than P. giganteus and its peak foraging activity occurred at 19:30 h, before that of P. giganteus. Foraging activities involved short searching flights followed by landing and removal of the corolla by mouth. Cynopterus sphinx detached single corollas from fascicles and carried them to nearby feeding roosts, where it sucked the juice and spat out the fibrous remains. Pteropus giganteus landed on top of the trees and fed on the corollas in situ; its peak activity occurred at 20:30 h. This species glided and crawled between the branches and held the branches with claws and forearms when removing fleshy corollas with its mouth. Both C. sphinx and P. giganteus consumed fleshy corollas with attached stamens and left the gynoecium intact. Bagging experiments showed that fruit-set in bat-visited flowers was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than in self-pollinated flowers.",

Thus some mechanisms which maintain group cohesion are expected. Dawn swarming is a set of behavioural displays observed in many such bats before they enter the roost. It is suggested that this behaviour plays a role in transferring information about the roost position. However this phenomenon had not been explored in detail. Based on qualitative and quantitative description of behaviour we suggest its potential function. Using field-based video-recordings of swarming sessions made on maternity colonies of Leisler’s bat (Nyctalus leisleri), we constructed ethograms which revealed remarkably similar behavioural sequences among individuals. For more than two hours prior to sunrise, individual flybys in front of the roost entrance predominated, followed by landings and leaps, which preceded the final entering of the roost. Interestingly, no obvious peak of behavioural activity was found at any particular time during swarming but a wave-like pattern was observed. We suggest that individuals are swarming in close proximity to the roosting tree with some purpose, most probably serving as a beacon for other group members and thus marking the current location of the roost.",

Behaviors were recorded applying a digital video camera to characterize diurnal activities, and from these an ethogram was constructed. Scan sampling and focal sampling were used to analyze the recorded behaviors. Four long behavioral states and seven short behavioral events were distinguished. During the diurnal period, most bats were inactive and were presumed to be sleeping, although at least one individual always remained active and alert. The fact that at least one bat was always alert during the day-roosting period suggests that some level of vigilance may be needed for bats to successfully occupy exposed roosts. Although the bats were inactive more than 80% of the day-roosting period, this was an interrupted phenomenon since individuals did not sleep continuously for more than 20 min (on average) when they were observed sleeping. Differences between the single harem male and an associated female were significant in terms of the frequency of states and events, and duration of some behavioral states. The harem male was active (i.e. alert) 13% of time of the diurnal period, whereas the female was active 1% of the time during this same period. Differences may be related to predation risks or actual and potential incursions of other males into the roost. The male allocated 4% of his time to grooming, whereas the female allocated 9% of her time to grooming, which may be related to the female’s reproductive condition.",

Echolocation calls were recorded using a Pettersson D980 bat detector, the high frequency output fed into a personal computer via an F2000 Control Filter and an Ines High speed card. Recorded as .wav files, recordings were analyzed with BatSoundPro. We measured call duration (DUR in ms), frequency with maximum energy (FMAX in kHz), highest frequency (HF in kHz), lowest frequency (LF in kHz), and inter-pulse interval (IPI in ms). Multivariate Analyses of Variance (MANOVA) indicated significant differences in call features between species, between settings, between species in each setting, and finally between settings for each individual. Discriminant Function Analyses (DFA) revealed that inside DUR was the most important parameter distinguishing M. lucifugus from M. leibii, with 66.3% correct classification, while outside, the two species were distinguished 78.8% of the time by LF. The data demonstrate that the same individuals flying in confined spaces change the details of their echolocation calls compared to when flying in the open. Calls produced inside are shorter in DUR and are produced at shorter IPIs than calls produced outside. FMAX differed most between the calls of M. lucifugus and M. leibii whether flying inside or outside. Differences between echolocation calls were more pronounced between setting (inside versus outside) than between species.",

This recently discovered structure develops exclusively during the mating season that occurs once a year between November and December in populations of L. curasoae from northern Venezuela. Although the dorsal patch that develops in males has unique chemical characteristics possibly involved in female attraction, we suggest that this trait also sends distinct visual cues regarding the health status of males. We evaluated the postulated association between dorsal patch shape (symmetry) and ectoparasite load (streblid batflies) in males of L. curasoae. To do so, we quantified the shape of dorsal patches on males to test the hypothesis that streblid load was related to this variable. Over 2,000 streblid batflies of two different species (Nycterophilia coxata and Trichobius sphaeronotus) were recovered from 130 individuals (0 = 16 streblids/bat). Among these batflies, N. coxata was the most abundant species found on L. curasoae (2,042 individuals, 95.0% prevalence). Males with dorsal patches had significantly lower batfly loads when compared with males without dorsal patches and with females. Males with the most symmetrical dorsal patches also had the lowest batfly loads. Our results suggest that the odoriferous dorsal patches produced in males of L. curasoae also convey visual cues to female mates as signals of good health.",

Plecotus auritus is common, but in the decline in the UK and although there have been studies of its roost use in Scotland, little is known of its roost biology in the milder south-west of England. This study compared five internal and three landscape features of roosts in stone buildings with those of random and paired unoccupied buildings in Cornwall (UK) in order to determine the roost selectivity of the brown long-eared bat. Bats selected roosts mainly for their vicinity, and connection, to foraging habitat. Occupied buildings were thus more likely to be situated closer to deciduous woodland than random control buildings, and were connected through tree lines. Roosts were also found to have a roof space divided into more compartments than paired and random controls and no insulation These characteristics influence the building microclimate. These findings suggest that P. auritus is selective of its roosts both at the building and the landscape levels.",

            "abstractNote": "In the tropics, rainfall seasonality seems to be the most important factor affecting bat reproductive cycles, triggering reproductive activity or by its indirect affect on the availability of food resources. Considering this, we studied the reproductive phenology of three phyllostomid fruit-eating bats (Artibeus jamaicensis, Dermanura phaeotis and A. intermedius) in a markedly seasonal coastal wetland in northwestern Yucatan Peninsula. Bats were sampled with mist nets during a consecutive 3-year period in 16 naturally formed forest islands and we assessed the reproductive condition of captured bats during the dry and rainy seasons. Sampling effort of 196 nights (11,100 net-hours), resulted in the capture of 738 individuals of A. jamaicensis (40%), D. phaeotis (32%), and A. intermedius (28%). At least 91% of the males captured showed reproductive evidence (males with testes descended) for the three species throughout the year. For D. phaeotis and A. intermedius we detected seasonal changes in reproductive activity of females associated with rainfall seasonality. In these two bat species a higher abundance of pregnant females during the dry season and presence of lactating females in both seasons indicated a seasonal polyoestry pattern (with an emphasis of pregnancy and births in the dry and early rainy season, respectively). In the case of A. jamaicensis, a similar abundance of reproductive females (pregnant or lactating) between seasons suggested the existence of an aseasonal polyoestry pattern for this species. Fruit availability in the study area might influence the reproductive patterns observed for the three bat species.",

We conducted a series of inventories across the country between 2005 and 2009, resulting in the identification of 50 species from 41 sites. Of these, seven species represent new national records that increase the country total to 67 species. These data include results from the first detailed surveys across northern Mozambique, over an area representing almost 50% of the country. We detail information on new distribution records and measurements of these specimens. Special attention is paid to the Rhinolophidae, because these include several taxa that are currently in a state of taxonomic confusion. Furthermore, we also present some notes on taxonomy, ecology and echolocation calls. Finally, we combine modelled distributions to present predicted species richness across the country. Species richness was lowest across the coastal plain, to the east and far north, and is predicted to increase in association with rising altitude and higher topographic unevenness of the landscape.",

We present evidence showing that at least seven species of Hipposideros co-occur at Mount Nimba at the northern boundary of the Upper Guinean forest zone. The species H. lamottei has been misdiagnosed previously, partly as a result of errors in published measurements. This taxon is currently known only from high-altitude grasslands in northern (Guinean) Mount Nimba. Cytochrome b sequences and echolocation calls of this species, as well as for H. marisae, are presented for the first time. Also, at least two different species groups, previously lumped in H. ruber, co-exist syntopically here. Mount Nimba apparently represents a diversity hotspot for species of Hipposideros in West Africa, and as a result may be an important site for their conservation.",

We investigated the community structure of bats in riparian areas and the surrounding savanna landscape in Swaziland’s lowveld using mist nets and a harp trap. We found riparian sites overall had higher bat activity, diversity, species richness and abundance. One species (Epomophorus wahlbergi) accounted for 52.6% of captures. Seasonality had no effect on overall captures, nor did distance from nearest riparian habitat for savanna sites. Echolocation guilds were correlated with vegetation characteristics, with CF (constant frequency), FM (steep frequency-modulated) and FM-QCF (broadband FM) bats more frequently captured at sites with denser undergrowth than QCF (quasi-constant frequency or narrowband FM) bats; conversely, QCF bats were more frequently caught at sites with lower canopy cover than other bats. Our findings suggest that although bats discriminate between microhabitats, they do not respond to larger-scale habitat features in the way that other taxa, such as birds, are found to. In conclusion it appears that riparian areas are important foraging sites for bats within African savannas.",

During its foraging activity, M. minutus searches for insects emitting rather long and narrow-band echolocation calls. Search call design however, can vary noticeably even in a continuous foraging pass. While echolocating in different flying conditions M. minutus uses several other call designs such as short CF, QCF, FM/QCF, FM and multi-harmonic FM, with or without harmonic overlap, and QCF/FM. Call plasticity characterizes most echolocation sequences, particularly in bats flying in open spaces. Call variation was also influenced by the presence of conspecifics. In those sequences containing echolocation calls from more than one bat, signals from different individuals were reliably identified. In contrast to other small molossids, the call designs in the echolocation inventory of M. minutus show a high level of plasticity. Our results suggest that M. minutus has combined the advantages of emitting several call designs, as shown by molossids, with the advantages of manipulating one signal design as shown by vespertilionids within the same sonar inventory.",

In this study, summer roost site selection of pregnant and lactating soprano pipistrelles were investigated using radio telemetry (2004–2006) in a fiord landscape with complex topography at the species northern extreme. The soprano pipistrelles’ common roost sites were in hollow trees (n = 14), but they also used crevices in rock walls (n = 2) and the attic of one building. The bats exclusively sought out roosts on the north side of the fiord with the slope facing south, where solar irradiation yielded the warmest micro climate. From 2005 to 2014, bat boxes were erected at three sites in the study area. From 2012 to 2014 we only found maternity roosts in such structures, thus there was a clear shift in roost site selection by the soprano pipistrelle in the study area. Man-made structures, such as buildings and bat boxes, provided the warmest cavities, whereas natural cavities did not differ significantly from air temperatures. The bats did not find thermo neutral roosts most of the time, and this should affect the energy budgets, and thus the bats´ behaviour. Direct observation of predation at roosts in build-up areas suggests that living close to humans could be costly to bats emerging in daylight conditions. No predation attempts were recorded at roosts in woodland habitats.",

Population viability analysis may help guide population management and the identification of populations more prone to decline, allowing a preventive approach to avoid population declines and extinctions. The objective of the present study was to evaluate if differences in reproductive strategy translate into differential intrinsic vulnerability among different populations of Phyllostomus hastatus. We used the software VORTEX to model the dynamics and viability of P. hastatus populations under different reproductive scenarios. We modeled a total of 12 scenarios evaluating variations in reproductive characteristics of the species (monoestry vs polyestry, harem size, and infant mortality rate). Phyllostomus hastatus populations were viable under most scenarios, except with scenarios incorporating monoestry and high pup mortality. Our results demonstrate that both reproductive strategies (monoestry and polyestry) found in P. hastatus result in viable and stable populations under natural conditions. However, polyestrous populations have higher growth rates, making them more resilient to natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances. A significant portion of the more resilient populations in South America overlap the Amazon Forest, a continuous and preserved habitat under low human pressure, which bodes well for the long-term persistence of these populations. On the other hand, the populations of the species that evolved the monoestrous reproductive strategy are located in Mesoamerica, a Biodiversity Hotspot that is under severe human impacts, particularly from habitat loss. Conservation biologists and managers must take into account intra-specific demographic differences of species when planning for their long-term persistence.",

Interactions among these bats, their food plants, and the climate were studied in an Atlantic Forest area in Southeastern Brazil. Path analysis was used to estimate the strength of direct and indirect effects through which variables determine the timing of bat reproduction. Temperature had a small direct influence, but a strong indirect one. Rainfall affected bat reproduction through indirect ways. Although the consumption of Piper fruits by bats did not have a significant influence, the timing of production of Piper fruits was a strong variable directly affecting bat reproduction. We therefore suggest that Piper plants and climate may play a keyrole in the timing of reproduction in C. perspicillata bats.",

In this study, a 282 bp fragment of the mtDNA control region and six microsatellites loci were used to reconstruct its demographic history using summary and coalescent based statistics. Our results suggest that M. vivesi experienced a demographic population expansion between 230,000 to 50,000 years ago. After this expansion, M. vivesi experienced a slight reduction in the effective population size between 30,000 to 5,000 years ago and a spatial expansion in the last 5,000 years. Population changes observed in M. vivesi could be related to climatic changes that occurred in the Gulf of California in the Pleistocene and Holocene periods.",

Searches for bats were carried out during daylight hours and at evening emergence. Thirty eight of the 238 buildings surveyed from May to August, 2002 were used by 708 bats. Only three of the 12 resident species of bats occupied buildings, amongst these Vespertilio murinus and Eptesicus serotinus were the most common, found in 16 and 15 buildings, respectively. Pipistrellus pygmaeus was located in two buildings. This suggests that limited access to old-growth forests (potentially rich in tree cavities) may not be a crucial factor leading to the occupation of buildings by those species. Selection of buildings by bats was further investigated by comparing 14 characteristics of those buildings occupied by bats to those unused. Six of these characteristics were shown to have a significant influence. Using Akaike’s Information Criterion (AICc), the most important categories for selection were roof lining and building size. This would suggest that the criterion for the selection of buildings by these species is based not only on its location but on these key structural attributes.",

In our genetic analysis we used SINEs (short interspersed elements) of nuclear DNA as genetic markers, and by means of Inter-SINE-PCR, have clearly demonstrated a species distinctiveness of M. petax. Our further analysis has also shown, that they considerably differ from M. daubentonii s.str. in skull proportions, dental features, as well as in bacular shape and size. Both species also differ in their ecology and general appearance, especially coloration.",

This migrating species is monoestrous with copulation occurring around April in South African populations. Embryonic development is stalled during hibernation by delayed implantation of the blastocyst. As a result, limb bud stage embryos (CS13) are first noted in other South African populations in mid-September. The timing of these reproductive events for the De Hoop population is similar with bats arriving at the maternity roosts in September and embryos at the limb bud stage (CS13) being noted in this month. Pregnancy was not synchronous in the population with bats dissected on the same day exhibiting differences in the stage of development of their young (CS11 to CS21 being the largest range). Maternal features (progesterone concentration, body mass and abdominal distension) were analysed to determine if they provided a reliable estimate of embryonic stage. The progesterone concentrations of pregnant bats showed a similar profile to the Kwa-Zulu Natal and the Eastern Cape populations. Though progesterone concentration did increase as pregnancy progressed, it was not an accurate predictor of embryonic stage. Maternal body mass did not correlate with the stage of embryonic development. However, abdominal distension determined by palpation is an accurate field based predictor of the stages of pregnancy: no abdominal distension, small to medium abdominal distension and large abdominal distension distinguished between non-pregnant bats and those carrying either early (CS11–CS15) or mid-developmental stages (CS16–CS21), respectively.",

            "abstractNote": "Autumnal foraging behaviour and habitat use by Tadarida teniotis were studied in Southern Portugal, using seventeen radio-marked individuals, followed over multiple nights from fixed and mobile stations. Tadarida teniotis proved to be a late emerger, leaving the roost about one hour after sunset and, in contrast to most insectivorous bat species, only had one foraging bout. These bouts were very long, lasting an average of 6 hours and 39 minutes. Bout duration was unrelated to climatic conditions and so probably determined by foraging success. In the early evening almost all bats were foraging, but this activity declined steadily through the night. They kept flying even during fairly cold nights, but did not leave the roost on the coldest nights, in which they probably remained in torpor. As predicted by its body mass and wing morphology, T. teniotis was found to be a strong flyer, reaching speeds of over 50 km/h, and flying for up to 10 hours without resting periods. The observed speeds were 2.5 times higher than the predicted maximum range speed, which may be possible due to peculiar adaptations to high-speed flight. On most nights bats flew straight to a previously identified feeding site, but on a few they made slower indirect flights, suggesting a search for profitable foraging areas. Upon arriving to a feeding site most bats remained there for the rest of the foraging trip. The median size of these sites was just over 100 ha. Several tracked bats used the same feeding area simultaneously. The range of the colony had a radius of over 30 km, but most feeding sites were concentrated in a mountainous region located about 5 km north of the roost. The studied bats foraged preferentially over forested areas, particularly pine and cork oak woodlands. They used both alluvial plains and the valleys of a mountainous area, but not its ridges. Our observations support the hypothesis that T. teniotis is an opportunistic forager, depending on temporary concentrations of prey, such as insect swarms.",

Eleven extant and one extinct species were examined using geometric and linear morphometric analyses to evaluate morphological differences among species. Based on 19 landmarks located in the ventral side of the cranium, 29 size-standardized linear measurements were calculated and used for statistical multivariate analyses. Discriminant Function Analysis showed major interspecific differences in shape between A. anthonyi and A. concolor with respect to the remaining extant species of Artibeus. These two species are described as morphologically unique morphotypes with a broader rostrum, enlarged squamosal region, and wider basicranium. Specifically, a broader premaxilla is the character that better discriminates A. anthonyi from all other species, whereas a broader squamosal region (particularly the deep mandibular fossa, and elongated squamosal) and wider braincase are the main characters differentiating A. concolor. All other species of the genus overlap to varying extents in their morphology showing high shape similarities. The least variant shape features include the pterygoid fossa, the glenoid (mandibular) fossa, the maxillae, and the occipital region; these regions in all cases contribute to mechanical aspects of jaw function and bite. The fact that the least variant aspects of skull shape all involve feeding is consistent with the hypothesis that selection has favored a specific diet-associated morphology rather than divergence or character displacement in Artibeus.",

For each individual captured we recorded reproductive condition, seeds in feces, and pollen species. Of the 550 bats captured during 41 nights of sampling, 97% belonged to six species of Phyllostomidae, and 88.7% belonged to just three: Artibeus jamaicensis, Phyllonycteris poeyi and Monophyllus redmani. The total number of captures varied among the four sites, being higher in the two more disturbed sites although this may have been an artifact of the use of ground-level mist-nets in vegetation of different structure. However the higher capture frequencies found in these sites could be related to the availability of understory fruits and the less dense understory vegetation too, allowing some species to exploit resources farther from forest edges. On three sites, the captures included a common large frugivore, two common nectarivores, and two uncommon species. The species composition of these assemblages resembled that observed in previous studies in the better-conserved core zone of the Biosphere Reserve. This implies that food availability and vegetation structure might be more important influences than the conservation level of vegetation on the composition and structure of assemblages of Cuban phyllostomids. In spite of the reduced diversity of the assemblage we studied compared with mainland assemblages, the relative abundances of Cuban bats tend to be higher than some continental ones. This could be related to lower bat diversity and a higher degree of gregariousness of the Cuban phyllostomids.",

            "abstractNote": "One of the largest nursery colonies of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in Italy occurs in the Natural Park of Migliarino San Rossore Massaciuccoli, Tuscany, with the species roosting in several buildings. We identified various roosts used by R. ferrumequinum within the park and investigated their microclimatic parameters (temperature, relative humidity and daily temperature excursion). We monitored roost use for one year and found it not only to be influenced by season and the microclimatic conditions of different roosts, but also by occasional stress conditions such as disturbance by predators. We also studied nightly emergence behavior, specifically we considered how this is influenced by climatic (temperature, relative humidity and evening light intensity) and demographic (presence of pups, subadults and colony size) parameters. The colony always performed a pre-emergence behavior and we found that its onset occurred earlier at higher temperatures, lower evening light intensity, in larger colonies and in the presence of pups. High temperature and low evening light intensity also resulted in a longer nightly emergence, which was also identified in larger colonies and when subadults were present. This study highlights the importance of the conservation of multiple roosts within the distribution range of R. ferrumequinum nurseries. Additionally, we demonstrated how certain climatic and demographic factors influence both pre-emergence and emergence behavior.",

Of these, four families (Anacardiaceae, Bignonaceae, Malvaceae, and Sapotaceae) were identified from remnants of flower petals in food boluses while the remaining families (Annonaceae, Arecaceae, Ebenaceae, Meliaceae, Moraceae, Myrtaceae, and Sapindaceae) were identified from the seeds in the boluses and from guano samples. Plants in the family Moraceae (50.7%) comprised most of the bat’s diet. Fruit of Ficus retusa (27.5%) and F. carica (23.0%) during winter, F. glomerata (30.9%) and F. religiosa (28.1%) during spring, Psidium guajava (19.6%), F. bengalensis (18.7%) and Diospyros peregrina (17.8%) during summer, and D. peregrina (71.9%) during autumn, were the most frequently identified items. The four seasonal diets varied significantly (χ2 = 435, d.f. = 18, P < 0.01). Results confirm that the ecological services rendered by P. giganteus, such as pollination and seed dispersal, outweigh its losses, such as damage to the ripe fruit. Hence, the species should not be regarded as a pest; rather efforts should be made to ensure its conservation.",

In 2003, 2004 and 2005 we quantified the activity of insectivorous bats and their insect prey at pastureland and forest sites with and without cenotes (water-filled sinkholes) in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. We used a time-expansion bat detector to survey each habitat for 24 nights and analysed 2,880 one-minute recorded sequences to determine bat activity. We identified 14 species and five phonic types belonging to four families. Bat activity and the average number of bat species acoustically sampled each night were significantly greater in habitats with cenotes than in those without. Pteronotus personatus and an unidentified molossid were recorded exclusively at cenotes. Peropteryx macrotis showed the highest activity of all bat species. In all habitats insects were more abundant during the rainy season but only in pastureland was bat activity significantly greater during the rainy season. Insect abundance was correlated with bat activity only at cenotes in pastureland. Cenotes are important foraging habitats for insectivorous bats as 16 species, 84% of those revealed by this study, were recorded feeding in these habitats and the number of feeding buzzes was higher in comparison to habitats without cenotes. Protection of cenotes and their surrounding vegetation should be a management priority in order to conserve the high diversity of insectivorous bats associated with these distinctive habitats.",

Calls emitted in free flight, in a more or less uncluttered situation, were about 4.5 ms (up to 5.3 ms) long and characterized by a sweep of the first harmonic (= fundamental) from ca. 73 kHz down to about 23 kHz, which is unusually large for phyllostomid bats. A less intense second harmonic was always present. The intervals between pulses varied between 55 and 170 ms with a mean of about 110 ms. During approach to bushes or trees (or during flight in confined space between bushes), or in the flight room, calls became shorter (ca. 2 ms) and more energy was allocated to the second harmonic, sometimes also a third harmonic appeared. During approach to a fruit calls were further shortened (about 1 ms or less), and call frequency increased to about 5 calls/100 ms, calls often being grouped. The large bandwidth of the first harmonic separates Phyllops from all other Cuban bat species and allows identification in the field.",

            "abstractNote": "Between 2001 and 2008, we recorded Myotis alcathoe at nine sites within three distant areas in the Czech Republic. The species identification was confirmed with cyt b sequences and four distinct haplotypes were identified. All the localities exhibit surprisingly uniform habitat characteristics: (1) old full-grown oak-hornbeam forests, with (2) numerous large trees in advanced stages of decay are present, and (3) a very small to large water bodies and/or patches of riparian vegetation surrounded by the forest. Using radiotracking techniques, we discovered 27 day roosts of M. alcathoe, located mostly in big oak, birch and lime trees inside extensive forest stands. All roosts were fissures or small cavities in a tree trunk and in branches in the canopies, some 16 m above the ground. Bats preferred trees that were higher, had higher canopy and canopy basement and had larger diameter at breast height than other available trees. Roost trees were surrounded by lower trees with lower canopy basements than available trees. Roost trees were in a poorer condition than other available trees. Roosts were occupied by up to 83 individuals in July but usually single individuals were found in the roosts in September. In contrast to syntopic M. mystacinus and M. brandtii, M. alcathoe has never been found in an anthropogenic roost (except for a fissure in concrete electricity pole). Preliminary analysis of the diet showed that nematoceran flies were the most important prey item along with spiders, caddis flies, small moths and neuropterans. In the observed ecological characteristics, M. alcathoe markedly differs from other European species of the genus Myotis. Its restricted habitat requirements are perhaps responsible for an islet-like pattern of its distribution and suggest an essential conservation value of the habitats of its occurrence.",

Mining activity has resulted in a large number of abandoned mines, which may represent important refuges for the chiropteran fauna of the region. I surveyed a sample of 25 abandoned mines during an annual cycle to determine which species use the mines, how they use it, and whether occupation is significantly related to a set of environmental variables measured from the mines. Simultaneously I carried out an inventory of the chiropteran fauna in the area, to determine what portion of the assemblage use the mines. I recorded 13 species for the region (12 vespertilionids and 1 molossid), out of 18 that are likely to occur. Five species were never found in mines; the remaining use them as feeding roosts, temporary roosts, or hibernacula, and only Corynorhinus mexicanus was found forming a maternity colony. Bats were significantly (P < 0.05) more frequent in mines with winter temperature < 10°C, adits > 50 m, and less than 3°C temperature oscillation throughout the year. Results suggest that bats are more likely to occur in undisturbed mines, although the relationship was not significant (P = 0.09).",

Thirty germination trials were set up using seeds defecated by six bat species. Seeds of Piper multiplinervium and Ficus insipida, defecated by Carollia brevicauda and Artibeus jamaicensis, respectively, showed significantly higher germination percentages than seeds not ingested by bats. Of seven seed species regurgitated by bats, only Markea neurantha showed significant increases in percent germination compared to seeds not ingested by bats. Of 19 tents and three active feeding roosts found, 12 tents and three feeding roosts were in primary forest, while six tents were in abandoned plantations. For tent construction, four bat species used six plant species. Fifty-two percent of seeds found under tents and feeding roosts were from secondary forest species. Twenty-two percent of seed species in fecal samples from netted bats in three secondary forest types were primary forest species. Bats in our study dispersed seeds between different habitat types.",

We tested the response of Rafinesque’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) to social calls as a possible method to increase capture success and to understand the function of social calls. We also tested if calls of bats within the range of the previously designated subspecies differed, if the responses of Rafinesque’s big-eared bats varied with geographic origin of the calls, and if other species responded to the calls of C. rafinesquii. We recorded calls of Rafinesque’s big-eared bats at two colony roost sites in South Carolina, USA. Calls were recorded while bats were in the roosts and as they exited. Playback sequences for each site were created by copying typical pulses into the playback file. Two mist nets were placed approximately 50–500 m from known roost sites; the net with the playback equipment served as the Experimental net and the one without the equipment served as the Control net. Call structures differed significantly between the Mountain and Coastal Plains populations with calls from the Mountains being of higher frequency and longer duration. Ten of 11 Rafinesque’s big-eared bats were caught in the Control nets and, 13 of 19 bats of other species were captured at Experimental nets even though overall bat activity did not differ significantly between Control and Experimental nets. Our results suggest that Rafinesque’s big-eared bats are not attracted to conspecifics’ calls and that these calls may act as an intraspecific spacing mechanism during foraging.",

These ponds are scarce landscape elements and, despite their usually small size (< 1,000 m2), they support a considerable amount of biodiversity. We studied the patterns of use of these ponds by bats during the activity season in dry forest landscapes of a Mediterranean region using acoustic monitoring. Our hypothesis was that these ponds are valuable landscape elements for bats, and bat activity and richness species will be high over them. Bat activity and species richness were compared between ponds and adjacent sampling points in the forest matrix. We recorded 14 bat species and our results show that both general bat activity (all species grouped together) and species richness were higher in the ponds than in the forest areas. Bat activity was higher in June, however it decreased during drier months (July–August), while activity in the forest increased. The number of species was constant in the areas surrounding the ponds through the study period, but in the forest we observed an increase in July and a gradual decrease in August–September. Similar results were obtained for most individual species, although in some species activity was also influenced by temporal variables. Our study shows that the maintenance of small ponds may have important consequences for bat conservation, as they support high bat diversity, including some species of conservation concern like horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) or Myotis spp.",

By using these data, we develop empirical growth curves, derive growth rates, establish age-predictive equations, and compare growth parameters based on three nonlinear growth models. Neonates of M. macrodactylus were born within a half-month period, with length of forearm averaging ca. 38.4% of the size of adult females and body mass averaging ca. 39.6% of their mother’s body mass. Length of forearm increased linearly until 14 days after birth (growth rate = 1.20 mm/day), as did body mass until 11 days after birth (growth rate = 0.32 g/day). The length of the total gap of the fourth metacarpal-phalangeal joint decreased linearly from 13 days to 45 days of birth. Two most appropriate linear regression equations predicting the age of young bats were derived from forearm length (0 ± SE) from 15.35 ± 0.96 mm to 33.24 ± 1.87 mm and the length of the epiphyseal gap from 13 to 45 days. These two equations make it possible to estimate the age of pups from 1 to 45 days of age in M. macrodactylus. Of the three nonlinear growth models (logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy), the logistic equation provides the best fit to the empirical curves for length of forearm and body mass.",

Population decline may be indeed associated with diet specialization and unavailability of feeding resources, especially in modified environments. We studied the diet and prey selection of Rhinolophus hipposideros Borkhausen, 1797 in a modified Mediterranean landscape in Portugal, where this species is classified as vulnerable. Diet composition was evaluated by analyzing faecal pellets collected in a breeding colony of R. hipposideros, and the available arthropods were sampled using a light trap set outside the roost. The most consumed prey were Lepidoptera, Tipulidae (Diptera), Hymenoptera, Diptera and Neuroptera. Arthropod diversity remained fairly constant in the diet, but not in terms of prey availability. Our results show that R. hipposideros is a generalist species that feeds on a great number of prey species. However, our data suggest that, within the broad dietary niche, R. hipposideros is not opportunistic, actively selecting Diptera as a preferred food item. Despite the marked differences in foraging habitats, our results are closely match to those of studies done in Western and Central Europe, suggesting that R. hipposideros feeds on similar taxa all across Europe. However, as many studies indicate, this species selects broadleaved woodlands and riparian vegetation to forage, so conservation measures should take into account the protection of native forest and the maintenance of forest corridors among them, as R. hipposideros seems to avoid crossing open areas.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are important indicator species which can help in identifying areas where conservation efforts should be concentrated and whether these areas are affected by ongoing climate change. To elucidate factors limiting and influencing the elevational distribution of bats in a recognised biodiversity hotpot, the Soutpansberg mountain range (in Vhembe Biosphere Reserve) of northern South Africa, we collected data in and around the Luvhondo Private Nature Reserve, by catching and acoustically monitoring bats over an altitudinal gradient from 900 to 1,748 m. A total of 18 different species could be recorded. Two species, namely Pipistrellus hesperidus and Chaerephon cf. ansorgei appeared to be present and dominant at all altitudes. Activity, species richness and diversity significantly decreased with increasing altitude, whereas community composition was not related to altitude and no endemics to either low or high altitude were detected. It is likely that the change of species richness and diversity over altitude is caused by other factors correlated with altitude such as vegetation type, area size, energy availability and climatic differences. Our research demonstrated that lower altitudes are richer and more diverse in bat species and since no highland endemics have been discovered, conservation efforts in the area, regarding bats, should not ignore these lower altitudes which are most susceptible to human impacts leading to habitat degradation due to over-grazing, bush encroachment, cultivation and denudation of large trees for firewood collection.",

We studied the genetic variability of this species using two mitochondrial markers (the cytochrome b gene and the control region), from several Israeli colonies and from over most of the species’ range. Our results show that the cytochrome b sequences, unlike those of the control region, are too conserved to separate among R. microphyllum populations. Based on the control region sequences, a high level of sequence similarity was found within the Israeli population. Three clades were observed over the species’ range: Oriental, Intermediate and Palaearctic. This division supports most of the traditional taxonomy of the species. The Israeli population, which belongs to the Palaearctic clade, was found to be isolated from the Oriental and Intermediate clades. We suggest that the colonization of the greater mouse-tailed bat in the Levant occurred from African populations during the late Pleistocene, when many Saharan plants and animals penetrated the northern part of the Great Rift Valley.",

Although this is a speciose genus with some of the most common bats in Neotropical forests, resolution of taxonomy and their identification has been difficult. Our molecular phylogeny based on Bayesian and parsimony analyses of cytochrome b variation includes a well supported topology of A. glaucus glaucus sister to a clade of A. gnomus and A. glaucus bogotensis indicating that A. glaucus is a paraphyletic amalgam. A re-assessment of morphology corroborates differences between A. g. bogotensis from the Andean valleys of Colombia east into the Guianas and A. g. glaucus from western Amazonia. Thus, we recognize A. bogotensis and A. glaucus as distinct and allopatrically occurring species. Based on a Kimura-2 parameter model of substitution for cytochrome b, there was 1.2% sequence divergence within A. bogotensis, and 9.5% sequence divergence between A. bogotensis and A. glaucus. Compared to A. glaucus, A. bogotensis has prominent white facial stripes, a less hirsute interfemoral membrane, less robust orbitorostral region, and also lacks a small third lower molar. Within the Guiana region, there are three species with overlapping distributions (A. bogotensis, A. cinereus, and A. gnomus), however, they are sympatric only within the interior lowland forest near savannas. All other habitats including coastal forest, lowland forest, savanna, and highland forest have only two sympatric species, one of which is relatively more abundant (> 70%).",

The topology from a maximum parsimony analysis included: (1) A. obscurus and A. planirostris as sister species with successively basal lineages of (2) A. amplus, (3) a clade with A. lituratus and A. intermedius, (4) A. jamaicensis, (5) a clade of A. inopinatus sister to A. hirsutus and A. fraterculus, (6) A. fimbriatus, and (7) the most basal lineage of A. concolor. The individual species were monophyletic and well supported by bootstrap and decay values. The monophyletic clade of ((((obscurus + planirostris) + amplus) + (lituratus + intermedius)) + jamaicensis) was also highly supported, although some of the interspecific relationships were less so. Contrary to previous hypotheses of species limits based on a presumed intergradation in body size, A. jamaicensis and A. planirostris do not form a monophyletic group, refuting their conspecificity and supporting an earlier study concluding that these two taxa represent separate morphological populations. An analysis with A. jamaicensis and A. planirostris constrained as sister-taxa resulted in a tree 8 steps longer. In addition, the low genetic pair-wise difference between A. lituratus and A. intermedius (2.8% with Kimura-2 parameters) warrants closer examination of their species limits.",

            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous bats are major predators of nocturnal insects and have the potential to act as biological pest control agents in farmlands. The objective of the present study was to establish the diet of the guano bat, Tadarida plicata. The study was carried out at the Khao Chong Pran Cave, which houses 2.6 million bats, and is surrounded by rice fields. A total of 1,925 faecal pellets were collected from 385 bats during their morning return from January to December 2002. Faecal analysis indicated that T. plicata fed on at least nine insect orders: Homoptera (28.4%), Lepidoptera (20.8), Hemiptera (16.4), Coleoptera (14.4), Diptera (7.0), Hymenoptera (6.6), Odonata (6.0), Orthoptera (0.5) and Psocoptera (0.1). Light traps indicated that Coleoptera (41.2%), Homoptera (25.3), Hemiptera (18.8) and Diptera (12.7) were the most abundant insects in the study area. Homopterans, most of which were white-backed planthopper (Sogatella sp., Delphacidae) had the highest percentage frequency of occurrence in the bats’ diet indicating that T. plicata potentially plays an important role in controlling this major crop pest. The presence of macropterous planthoppers and a large proportion of moths in its diet suggests that T. plicata feeds on windborne migrant insects at high altitude. Female bats fed significantly more on lepidopterans and coleopterans and less on damselflies than males. The diet diversity index of lactating females was higher than pregnant females. Diet did not differ significantly between the dry and rainy seasons for either sex.",
