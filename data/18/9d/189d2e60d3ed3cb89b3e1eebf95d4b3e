            "abstractNote": "The taxonomy of Rhinolophus yunanensis Dobson, 1872 (Chiroptera: Rhinolophidae) is revised by reference to specimens collected from the provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan, China, and from Thailand. The Thai specimens are found to differ from the Chinese ones in external and cranial morphology and karyotype, and it is thus concluded that what has hitherto been R. yunanensis actually represents two distinct species, including a new one. The new species is described on the basis of 10 specimens collected from Chiang Mai, Thailand. It is the largest species of the pearsoni group of the genus, with a large skull and long ears. Rhinolophus yunanensis is redescribed on the basis of specimens collected from China. In Principal Component Analyses of the cranial morphometric data, the new species was completely separated from the redescribed R. yunanensis and R. pearsoni.",

            "creators": [],
            "abstractNote": "The habitat preferences and activity of greater mouse-eared bats were investigated by means of radio-telemetry in two regions in Upper Franconia (Bavaria, Germany) that are characterized by a mosaic of deciduous forests, coniferous forests and woodless areas. In one case bats roosted in a maternity colony from which they visited foraging habitats up to 10.8 km away; in the second, the bats started in a cave which served as a night roost. These bats foraged around the cave up to 2.5 km away. Mean size of foraging areas was 13.1 ± 4.6 ha. Most of the bats used several foraging areas per night (mean 5.1, range 1–10). Hunting time per foraging site ranged from 5 to 224 (median 25) minutes. Foraging habitats in some individuals remained constant over two consecutive years. The bats hunted almost exclusively in woodland (98% of the hunting time) with a significant preference for deciduous forests as opposed to coniferous forests. The preference for deciduous forests as foraging habitats is likely to be caused by: (1) a higher density of suitable prey animals and (2) a better accessibility of the ground-dwelling prey due to the lack of ground vegetation. The mean time span between emergence from the roost and return lasted about 5.5 hours. On average, 79.9 ± 9.0% of that time the bats spent flying. They behaved like other gleaning bats and did not show distinct activity peaks. The proportion of commuting flights (between roost and foraging area and between different foraging sites) added up to about 19% of the flight activity whereas the rest of the time in flight was spent hunting. Interruptions in the hunting activity occurred regularly, about five times per night and bat. These breaks lasted 1 to 130 (median 10) minutes and were spent in temporarily used night roosts and on perches. The bats hunted mainly during slow flight, but we also found evidence for hunting from perches on tree trunks as an additional foraging strategy.",

            "abstractNote": "Food habits data were obtained from 26 species of bats from Turkey. Barbastella barbastellus, Myotis capaccinii, M. mystacinus, Plecotus auritus, P. austriacus, P. kolombatovici, P. macrobullaris, and Rhinolophus euryale were primarily moth feeders. Eptesicus bottae, E. serotinus, Myotis myotis, and Taphozous nudiventris fed heavily on beetles. Myotis aurascens and, M. brandtii fed heavily on Diptera. Myotis blythii and Tadarida teniotis were tentatively classified as cricket feeders at least in Turkey. Hypsugo savii, Miniopterus schreibersii, Myotis emarginatus, M. nattereri, Pipistrellus kuhlii, P. pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, R. hipposideros, and R. mehelyi preyed on a variety of insects and may be treated as generalists. In 17 species, the foods found paralleled those previously reported in the literature, but in nine (some with notably small samples) they did not. These are apparently the first data on the food of Plecotus macrobullaris, P. kolombatovici, M. schreibersii, and M. aurascens.",

            "abstractNote": "Few studies have investigated the relationship between morphological variation and local feeding habits of bats in the United States. We used discriminant function analysis (DFA) to compare cranial morphology of Myotis occultus from southern Colorado, and central, and southern New Mexico. We analyzed guano collected from maternity colonies in southern Colorado and central New Mexico to compare food habits. Bats from southern Colorado had the smallest values on the first canonical variate (CV1) that also reflected the smallest measurements of key cranial and dental variables, including height of coronoid process, width of molar, and dentary thickness. Bats from central and southern New Mexico had intermediate and large CV1 values, respectively. Overall, CV1 discriminated individuals occurring in southern Colorado and central New Mexico from those in southern New Mexico. CV2 served best at discriminating bats of southern Colorado from those of central New Mexico. Comparison of food habits revealed that individuals from southern Colorado ate more soft-bodied prey items (e.g., flies) whereas bats from central New Mexico ate more hard-bodied prey items (e.g., beetles). As shown in earlier studies that investigated relationships between morphology and diet of insectivorous bats, we found differences in skull morphology of M. occultus that were correlated with differences in food habits.",

Externally similar to Murina aurata Milne-Edwards, 1872, from which it differs primarily in dental characteristics, the new species is distinguished from all other existing species of Murina by a combination of its small size, pelage and craniodental features. It is currently known from three localities in north Vietnam, all of which include significant areas of forest over limestone karst.",

            "creators": [],
            "abstractNote": "The islands of the West Indies are home to 56 species of bats, half of which are endemic to the region. Recently, researchers have begun to characterize the echolocation calls of the bat fauna of the West Indies. However, the majority of species have not yet been characterized and no studies have been conducted on most West Indian islands, including the islands of the Bahamas. Exuma, a small island in the Bahamas, has six species of bats classified in four families (Molossidae, Natalidae, Phyllostomidae, and Vespertilionidae). We used an ultrasonic detector (Avisoft UltraSoundGate 116) to study the echolocation calls of these bats, focusing on three species whose calls have not been previously described, Erophylla sezekorni, Macrotus waterhousii, and Nyctiellus lepidus. Each of these species uses low-intensity, frequency modulated echolocation calls and exhibits intraspecific call variation both among individuals and within individual call sequences. Despite this variation, we were able to accurately classify each species using discriminant function analysis. Accuracy rates varied from 94% (M. waterhousii) to 100% (E. sezekorni, N. lepidus). We also provide a preliminary description of the echolocation calls of two additional Exuman bat species, Lasiurus borealis and Tadarida brasiliensis. The echolocation calls of L. borealis and T. brasiliensis appear similar to their mainland counterparts; however, more study is needed to characterize the calls of these two species on Exuma.",

In this paper we present data on 19 species, comprising 12 species from the family Rhinolophidae and seven from the Hipposideridae. Rhinolophids captured were Rhinolophus affinis, R. ferrumequinum, R. lepidus, R. luctus, R. macrotis, R. siamensis, R. marshalli, R. rex, R. pearsonii, R. pusillus, R. sinicus and R. stheno. Because of extensive morphological similarities we question the species distinctiveness of R. osgoodi (may be conspecific with R. lepidus), R. paradoxolophus (which may best be treated as a subspecies of R. rex), R. huananus (probably synonymous with R. siamensis), and we are skeptical as to whether R. sinicus is distinct from R. thomasi. Hipposiderids captured were Hipposideros armiger, H. cineraceus, H. larvatus, H. pomona, H. pratti, Aselliscus stoliczkanus and Coelops frithii. Of these species, two rhinolophids (Rhinolophus marshalli and R. stheno) and one hipposiderid (Hipposideros cineraceus) represent new species records for China. We present data on species’ ranges, morphology and echolocation call frequencies, as well as some notes on ecology and conservation status. China hosts a considerable diversity of rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats, yet threats to their habitats and populations are substantial.",

Our results are based on a series of surveys conducted between 1999 and 2008 by Chinese researchers and international collaborators, spanning almost the entire range of pteropodids within China over nine provinces. Additionally we provide new information on morphometrics and notes on ecology. We also review earlier Chinese literature on fruit bats because much of this has previously been inaccessible to western scientists, and we evaluate the reliability of some of these older records. Thirteen species of fruit bats have been reputed to occur in China, including one species restricted to Taiwan. We classified Chinese fruit bats according to distribution and status as follows: Resident (six species, including one species formerly found in Taiwan and now restricted to its neighbouring islands), Marginal (three species), Questionable (one species) and Alien (three species). Consequently, only five species are encountered with any regularity in mainland China and Hainan Island: Cynopterus sphinx, Eonycteris spelaea, Macroglossus sobrinus, Rousettus leschenaultii, and Sphaerias blanfordi. Three species in the genus Pteropus are referred to in old records, but these bats are clearly not native to mainland China.",

The main objective of this project was to evaluate if these fluctuations can result in resource bottlenecks that affect the body condition of a temperate zone bat — Myotis myotis. Seasonal changes in body condition followed different patterns in Portugal and Germany, which have different climates. In Germany bats use thermally better hibernacula, which allow them to minimize energy expenditure, but because of the longer winters they emerge from hibernation in poorer condition. Except during the hibernation period, food was always abundant in Germany, but the condition of the animals was poor when bad weather constrained foraging, particularly in early spring. In Portugal food was limiting during the long dry summer, and this affected the condition of the animals for several months. The conclusion that food resources can act as a limiting factor is relevant for conservation because, like other bat species, M. myotis forages mostly in agricultural and forestry habitats, and can be affected by practices that accentuate resource bottlenecks. Where necessary, the management of agroecosystems near colonies of M. myotis and of other threatened bats should aim at minimizing seasonal food bottlenecks.",

Females of both species gave birth to twins at the end of May, and the infants flew in the last ten days of June. Vocalizations served as precursors to echolocation calls and as isolation calls (i-calls) used to attract mothers. As the infants grew, the frequency of i-calls and precursor calls increased. The duration of i-calls increased little before 6-day old and then decreased. At the same time, the duration of echolocation precursor calls decreased. The directive calls that the mother or the infant emitted when searching for each other are also described. Female directive calls are lower in frequency and longer in duration than their echolocation calls, and the duration of infant directive calls is longer than those of the i-calls and precursor calls.",

Ecological studies and conservation-oriented monitoring of bats in the tropics benefit from published libraries of echolocation calls, which are not readily available for many tropical ecosystems. Here, we present the echolocation calls of 15 species from the Valparai plateau in the Anamalai Hills, southern Western Ghats of India: three rhinolophids (Rhinolophus beddomei, R. rouxii (indorouxii), R. lepidus), one hipposiderid (Hipposideros pomona), nine vespertilionids (Barbastella leucomelas darjelingensis, Hesperoptenus tickelli, Miniopterus fuliginosus, M. pusillus, Myotis horsfieldii, M. montivagus, Pipistrellus ceylonicus, Scotophilus heathii, S. kuhlii), one pteropodid (Rousettus leschenaultii) and one megadermatid (Megaderma spasma). Discriminant function analyses using leave-one-out cross validation classified bats producing calls with a strong constant frequency (CF) component with 100% success and bats producing frequency modulated (FM) calls with 90% success. For five species, we report their echolocation calls for the first time, and we present call frequencies for some species that differ from those published from other parts of the species’ ranges. This exemplifies the need for more local call libraries from tropical regions to be collected and published in order to record endemic species and accurately identify species whose calls vary biogeographically.",

We radio tracked 13 pregnant and 12 lactating Myotis sodalis (Indiana bat) during the maternity season in northern Missouri. Mean (± SE) home range area for all individuals based on the fixed kernel method for the 50% and 95% probability contours was 204.52 ± 28.87 ha and 1137.13 ± 144.06 ha, respectively. Home range size did not differ significantly (P > 0.16) between pregnant and lactating females. However, the mean home range area based on the 95% probability contour for lactating individuals (1361.00 ± 267.16 ha) was 32% larger than the area used by pregnant individuals (930.47 ± 109.59). The mean maximum distance pregnant and lactating individuals were located from the roost was 3.75 km (range: 1.89–5.13 km) and 4.85 km (range: 2.17–9.40 km), respectively. Home range size and maximum distance traveled during the maternity season were greater than previously reported for M. sodalis. Our sample size is modest due to the rarity and patchy distribution of this endangered species, but we provide meaningful information on spatial area used to acquire necessary resources during the maternity season.",

To gain more insight, microbial communities in fecal samples from 37 insectivorous bats of different species from the Netherlands were investigated by polymerase chain reaction and denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Subsequently, 10 samples from the following bat species: common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus; n = 3), Daubenton’s bat (Myotis daubentonii; n = 3), serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus; n = 1), whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus; n = 1), Geoffroy’s bat (Myotis emarginatus; n = 1) and Natterer’s bat (Myotis nattereri; n = 1) were selected and used in bacterial 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing. The fecal microbiota in bats was found to be diverse with predominant bacterial genera Carnobacterium, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus and Yersinia. The presence of opportunistic pathogens Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Serratia fonticola and Rahnella aquatilis was also recorded. Based on cloning results, we found no proof that bats in the Netherlands are a major vector for the transmission of bacterial zoonotic diseases, although previous findings in literature reported isolation of foodborne pathogens from bats.",

The Christmas Island flying-fox is restricted to the 135 km2 Christmas Island (Indian Ocean), as either an endemic species Pteropus natalis or a markedly distinct subspecies of Pteropus melanotus. Given recent declines and extinctions of other native vertebrate species on this Island, this study sought to monitor population trends for this taxon. Monitoring flying-foxes at roost sites is difficult because they are highly vagile, not all roost sites may be known to observers, and dense vegetation at some sites may make counts inaccurate. These constraints are particularly evident on Christmas Island. In this study, we sought to establish a monitoring program complementary to roost counts, and to assess changes in reporting rate from a baseline sampling of 107 sites spaced across the Island in 2006 to a repeat sampling of those sites in 2012. Every site was visited four times, at night, over a period of 4–6 weeks in June–July of 2006 and of 2012, and observers reported whether or not they heard or saw flying-foxes around the sample site. A reporting incidence measure (varying from 0 to 4) was derived for every site. This measure showed a significant decline (of 39%) between the 2006 and 2012 sampling. The observed rate of decline suggests that this taxon is of considerable conservation concern, and merits further conservation action: indeed in 2014 its Australian conservation status was changed from not listed to Critically Endangered. The cause of the current decline is not yet known, but this study indicates that factors additional to hunting and habitat loss may affect island flying-fox species.",

Species diversity declined by 18–35% and evenness decreased by 0–35% throughout the region and in two specific areas. Changes in diversity and evenness were attributed primarily to decreases of 44% or more in relative abundance of the foliage-roosting eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis). Number of L. borealis captured per net-night decreased 52–85%. The decline in relative abundance of L. borealis suggested by mist netting was supported by a 10-fold decrease over 38 years in the proportion of L. borealis that were tested for rabies by the state health laboratory. The apparent decline in L. borealis is especially alarming in light of the recent upsurge in use of wind power and the large number of L. borealis that are killed at such developments. We recommend that other previously completed surveys in eastern North America be duplicated, as one way of helping to confirm or refute the trend that we have identified.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding population trends of any species is essential for conservation and management. However, due to difficulty in sampling some species, population status of many bat species is poorly understood. In an effort to resolve this issue, especially in light of emerging threats (e.g., white-nose syndrome and wind energy), a national mobile acoustic monitoring protocol, modeled after European programs, was developed to survey summer bat populations in the United States. While the program calls for conducting transects along roadways, some have suggested that waterways may allow for the gathering of more information. Therefore, we quantified species richness and abundance along car and boat transects to identify the most efficient mobile method. Furthermore, to compare the capabilities of mobile acoustic transects to a more traditional and better understood survey method, we compared species density along transects to stationary acoustic detectors. Using sample-based rarefaction, there was no difference at the 95% confidence level in species density (species/sample) between methods, however stationary points accumulated species more quickly than mobile methods. Of the mobile transect methods, car transects had higher diversity indices than boat transects and tended to show slightly higher species density. While over 1.5 times as many calls were recorded and identified along boat transects, there were no clear advantages of boat transects for monitoring bats except for Myotis grisescens. Additionally, car transects were least time consuming, leading us to conclude that car transects are the most efficient mobile acoustic method to monitor species. Mobile acoustic transects can likely monitor 2–4 species in the Eastern United States, including species with no current population monitoring methodology.",

Total counts of bats at three identified roosts varied from 7,000 to 48,000 individuals. The bats moved between roosts within the same general area, probably reflecting seasonal variation in the availability of preferred foods and/or harassment and direct persecution at some roost sites by the rural community. Our study suggests that tree density and number of branches on trees were important factors in roost site selection for E. helvum, and the removal of roost trees has serious ramifications for their conservation in the region. Germination experiments and observations at roost sites indicated that E. helvum consumed fruits from 31 plant species of 16 families, potentially assisting in the dispersal of their seeds. Further monitoring is needed to provide a complete picture of the status and migration patterns of E. helvum in Kenya. Additionally, because the bats were viewed negatively and persecuted by roost tree clearance and direct eradication attempts, an education and community outreach programme in local schools and communities is proposed for the long-term conservation of viable populations of E. helvum in western Kenya.",

            "abstractNote": "Recent advances in molecular techniques have provided new tools for confirming species identities, however they can be expensive and results are not immediately available. Myotis lucificugus and M. yumanensis are morphologically cryptic species of bats sympatric in western North America that can be difficult to distinguish in the field. We evaluated a set of models that used morphological and echolocation call characters obtained in the field to predict species identity as determined by DNA analysis. We constructed models using data from 98 M. lucifugus and 100 M. yumanensis captured throughout the Pacific Northwest from which we had obtained high-quality, time-expansion recordings of their echolocation calls. The best model for distinguishing the species combined forearm length and characteristic frequency of echolocation calls and was able to identify 92% of M. lucifugus and 91% of M. yumanensis individuals, with ≥ 95% confidence. We evaluated the applicability of our model by testing it on additional datasets. Our model correctly classified 83% of M. lucifugus (n = 30) and 93% of M. yumanensis (n = 29) individuals captured in north-central Oregon, whose echolocation calls were recorded using a zero-crossings echolocation detection system. It also correctly classified 86% of M. lucifugus (n = 22) and 85% of M. yumanensis (n = 26) individuals, captured throughout our study area, for which only poor-quality time-expansion recordings of echolocation calls were obtained. Combining morphometrics with echolocation call characteristics may be a useful approach for distinguishing among pairs of cryptic species of bats in other areas.",

            "abstractNote": "We studied the wing morphology, echolocation calls, diet and emergence time of the black-bearded tomb bat (Taphozous melanopogon) from May to October 2006 in Guangxi Province, southwest China. Taphozous melanopogon has wings with high aspect ratio, high loading and pointed wing-tip shape-characteristics associated with fast flight in open space. This species usually produces low-intensity, low frequency, and frequency-modulated (FM) calls usually containing up to four harmonics, with most energy in the second (or sometimes third) harmonic. The diet of this species consists mostly of Lepidoptera and Hemiptera. Timing of evening emergence is correlated with the time of sunset. This is the first study to describe the flight and echolocation behavior of this species in China, and opens the way for future studies of its biology.",

The causative agents are European Bat Lyssavirus Type-1 (EBLV-1) and Type-2 (EBLV-2). The natural host of EBLV-1 seems to be the serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) with more than 95% of all cases reported in this species. Although much fewer EBLV-2 cases have been identified, it seems that Myotis dasycneme and M. daubentonii are likely to be the principal hosts’ species for this virus. The ecological mechanisms underlying the transmission of EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 are still poorly understood. In order to assess the public health risks associated with EBLVs and the implications for bat conservation, some issues need urgent clarification. In this review some of the most pressing topics will be addressed. Only collaboration between a range of disciplines that include virologists, epidemiologists and bat conservationists will be able to elucidate some of these unanswered questions.",

Males thus store spermatozoa in the cauda epididymidis for 4.5–6.5 months of the year. Assessments of sperm motility, movement pattern and computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) were carried out on spermatozoa which had been stored for over 3.5 months in the cauda epididymidis. The motility of sperm stored for the same period of time and taken from a male which died over 9 h before assessment was 86%. Four kinds of culture media were screened for their suitability for future studies of sperm motility, and a low calcium minimal capacitation medium and a hamster fertilization medium were selected. Serum testosterone (T) concentration increased dramatically in September and began to fall in October, before returning to baseline for the remainder of winter. These results indicate that high levels of T are required for spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis but not for sperm storage.",

            "abstractNote": "A characteristic feature of forest-dwelling bats is that they regularly switch day roosts. The additional time associated with finding or assessing the availability of a new roost, moving offspring to the new roost, coordinating with other group members, and meeting any increased energetic demands that may be associated with these behaviors may influence the number and duration of feeding bouts of reproductive females. To examine the influence of roost-switching on nocturnal activity patterns we radio-tagged lactating female silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and monitored them on nights when they moved to a new roost site and nights when no roost shift occurred. The typical activity pattern on a non-move night consisted of an initial long bout away from the day roost (median length: 177.4 min) followed by alternating bouts in (50.6 min) and away (57.0 min) from the roost for the rest of the night. On move nights bats reduced the length of their first absent period (82.7 min) and increased the number of trips from the roost, although neither the length of these subsequent absent periods nor the total time absent from the roosts differed from non-move nights. Similarly, total time spent in roosts did not differ between move and non-move nights, but bats made more and shorter visits on move nights. Visits to original and new roosts were not synchronous among colony members, and the length of time for individuals from the same colony to move to a new roost varied from 1 to 4 h. Our results indicate that roost switching did not influence the total time spent in or away from day roosts. Rather, bats moved between the original roost, the new roost, and foraging areas with much greater frequency on move nights.",

            "abstractNote": "Islands are biodiversity hotspots, often containing numerous endemic species. This makes them also hotspots for conservation. Within the Mediterranean region, Sardinia is known for its comparatively high degree of endemism, including cryptic diversity. In this paper we aim to elucidate the variability of pipistrelles (Pipistrellus and Hypsugo) on Sardinia. More specifically, we ask which species occur on Sardinia and we describe the geographic affiliations of these evolutionary lineages. We sequenced ca. 560 bp of the 16S rRNA gene from 36 pipistrelle specimens representing 17 localities from all major parts of Sardinia. For comparison we added samples from the entire Mediterranean region as well as sequences stored at GenBank. We constructed Bayesian phylogenetic trees and minimum spanning networks to identify which species occur on Sardinia and to infer their genetic affiliation to lineages occurring throughout the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. We identified five pipistrelle lineages on Sardinia: Pipistrellus pipistrellus (haplolineage II), P. pygmaeus, P. kuhlii/desertii, Hypsugo savii s.str. and H. cf. darwinii. Colonization of Sardinia occurred at different times from different geographical sources, namely Europe and Africa. Some lineages may have invaded Sardinia recently. The Sardinian H. cf. darwinii may be endemic to the island. Our results highlight the importance of Sardinia as a major Mediterranean hotspot for bat biodiversity. The island harbours a pipistrelle diversity that is higher than that on any other Mediterranean island. Lying geographically at the interface between Europe and Africa, Sardinia combines elements from both continents.",

            "abstractNote": "Acquiring hormonal data from small, free-ranging mammals can be challenging when conventional techniques pose too much stress on animals, e.g., by trapping, handling, and bleeding. We assessed the feasibility of measuring plasma testosterone levels indirectly via fecal testosterone metabolites (Tmet) in a small, tropical mammal, the greater sac-winged bat. Saccopteryx bilineata forms stable, harem-polygynous societies, in which males defend female groups throughout the whole year. Firstly, we validated fecal Tmet measurements by performing a challenge experiment using gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). Secondly, we compared Tmet concentrations of harem males and subordinate males in fecal samples collected during the mating season, expecting that fecal Tmet concentrations should be higher in harem than in subordinate males. Thirdly, we monitored fecal Tmet concentrations, courtship intensity and territoriality of harem males during and after the mating season, expecting that fecal Tmet values in conjunction with courtship intensity and territoriality drop after the estrous period of females passed. Our study shows that fecal Tmet concentrations responded to injections of GnRH in male S. bilineata. Fecal Tmet concentrations were higher in harem males than in subordinate males, suggesting that plasma testosterone values were related to either age or social status. Intensity of courtship and territoriality of harem males decreased towards the end of the mating season, but fecal Tmet concentrations remained constant. Male courtship intensity and territoriality were not related to fecal Tmet levels, either because short-term social challenges are not reflected in fecal hormone measurements owing to the propensity of fecal hormone metabolites to integrate over several hours, or because androgen levels are not strongly related to social activities in this species.",

            "abstractNote": "Islands and insular biotas have been recognized as ideal models for studying adaptive radiations and evolutionary processes. In the present study we investigated the Jamaican fruit-eating bat, Artibeus jamaicensis from Cozumel Island, to evaluate the effect of ecological features on genetic diversity and structure across three different environments, semi-evergreen tropical forest, mangrove, and cenotes, using six microsatellite loci in 105 individuals. Genetic diversity was relatively high (forest HO = 0.693, HNei = 0.825; mangrove HO = 0.702, HNei = 0.710; cenotes HO = 0.695, HNei = 0.847). Pairwise genetic differentiation measures between localities were not significant and the overall level of differentiation was markedly low (FST = 0.009, G’ST = 0.088). Likewise, results showed that A. jamaicensis consists of one genetic group and relatedness among individuals was low. Results are concordant with our predictions that the island population will show high genetic diversity and null structure at the fine spatial scale examined. We conclude that ecological features like dispersal and generalist habits are the factors influencing population structure and genetic diversity of A. jamaicensis on the island, and that factors like the species polygynous mating system, female philopatry and male differential dispersal do not prevail in the island population. Cozumel Island is facing severe conservation problems, mainly from habitat perturbation, urbanization and introduction of exotic species, hence the present genetic information is of great value as a basis for future research and protection of the species.",

We studied genetic diversity in these bats in the Niokolo Koba National Park using sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to determine the taxonomic status of the two genetic forms, and included skull morphology for comparison. Detailed multidimensional analysis of skull measurements indicated slight morphological differences between the two genetic forms. Exploration of peak frequency of the constant-frequency echolocation signals in a local population of Hipposideros aff. ruber was not available for both groups. Phylogenetic comparison with other available West African representatives of H. aff. ruber revealed paraphyletic relationship of the two Senegalese forms, with the less abundant form from Senegal forming a monophyletic group with that from Benin. Based on genetic divergence and sympatric occurrence, the two forms from Senegal might represent cryptic species. However, absence of nuclear gene flow between them is yet to be investigated to demonstrate their reproductive isolation.",

Area, latitude, and temperature range explained more than 73% of the total variability in European bat species richness. Latitude and temperature corrected species-area relationships of vespertilionid bats were fitted by the power function model with mainland countries having a lower slope (z = 0.09) than islands (z = 0.15) consistent with current theory. The area corrected centre of vespertilionid species richness was at about 46°N with Croatia being most species rich (34 species). Nonvespertilionid bats peaked at 41°N and did not show a simple latitudinal gradient. The inclusion of plant species richness in the model for Vespertilionidae did not lower the significant influence of area and latitude on species richness. Plant species richness itself was not a major predictor of bat species richness. Three environmental characteristics (latitude, area and temperature) are the main predictors of bat species richness in Europe. These attributes act in an additive manner. This phenomenon allows potential covariates to be eliminated from speciesarea relationships using simple regression techniques. Further, additive models constructed in this way allow for a ranking of countries with respect to species richness.",

Most studies on the use of tree cavities by bats have focused on analysing occupancy by a single species, and not by the entire bat community. To provide guidelines for forest management conducive to sustaining bats in a temperate lowland European forest, we studied the occupancy of tree cavities by bats of all species. In six different habitat types of 4 to 10 ha, all tree cavities were recorded and described according to 47 qualitative and quantitative descriptive variables. Logistic regression analyses were computed to predict the occupancy of cavities by bats, and to identify the most relevant variables for use as bat roosts. With or without potential competitors in the analyses, bats mainly used cavities in healthy main branches, with a large entrance located high above the ground. They did not use peeling bark or cavities on secondary branches, nor cavities covered by spider webs. Despite a large number of potential roosts in the area, bats tend to be selective and the types of roosts were less diverse than described in the literature. Not surprisingly guidelines for forest management aimed at bat conservation include keeping healthy old trees, which provide various types of cavities.",

Information was gathered from literature records, survey data, and museum collections. Detailed locality information, by province (with co-ordinates where available) and maps, along with details on specimens or published references are provided for each species. Based on these records, the bat checklist for Lao PDR comprises 90 species of seven families: Pteropodidae (nine species), Emballonuridae (three species), Megadermatidae (two species), Rhinolophidae (16 species), Hipposideridae (11 species), Vespertilionidae (47 species) and Molossidae (two species). Many of these records have not been previously published and several corrections are provided to previously published records, based on revised identifications as well as new taxonomic information. Nevertheless, many gaps remain in the information available on the bats of Lao PDR. No records were available from two provinces, and many species known from adjacent countries have not yet been documented in Lao PDR; thus, it is anticipated that the species list will increase with further field research.",

            "abstractNote": "The common mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii) is a mormoopid bat living in caves in lowland rainforests throughout the north and eastern Neotropics, including several Caribbean islands. Recent studies have shown that this taxon is certainly a composite of several cryptic species, especially in the western part of the Guianan Shield, where molecular reconstructions and bioacoustics point to the presence of at least two cryptic species that may not be related to genuine P. parnellii, native to Jamaica. We examined here over 200 bioacoustically identified individuals to show that two phonic types live in sympatry in French Guiana with no overlap in frequencies of echolocation calls. Morphological variation in some skull characters showed consistent and significant differences between the two phonic types, whereas external measurements alone were unable to discriminate between groups. Two mitochondrial markers analyzed in a selection of each of these phonic types were further used to evidence that they represent two genetically discrete groups, and to assign them to the existing molecular clades described elsewhere. Molecular comparisons with reference specimens sampled near the type localities of P. parnellii and P. rubiginosus further suggest that the 53 kHz phonic type found in French Guiana and Amapa (Brazil) should be assigned to the later species, while the 59 kHz phonic type represents an undescribed species.",

            "abstractNote": "The onset of activity in animals restricted to being active for only part of the day is one of the most fundamental aspects of their biology because it marks the beginning of activities that they need to do to survive and reproduce. Initiation of activity is subject to several factors including presence/absence of predators and the vagaries of environmental conditions at the time of emergence. We tested if the emergence times amongst seven species of sympatric insectivorous bats were explained by predation risk, insect activity and weather conditions. We measured bat emergence times by recording echolocation calls. Peak emergence was correlated with body size, time of sunset, foraging strategy and diet, factors associated with risk of predation. Larger, faster flying bat species emerged earlier than smaller, slower flying species suggesting the former relied on flight speed to avoid predation. Clutter foragers emerged earlier than clutter-edge and open foragers, suggesting that vegetative cover is important for bats trying to avoid predation. Bats feeding on Lepidoptera emerged earlier than bats feeding on Diptera. However, insect peak activity was highly variable and did not differ between orders or time of season. Emergence time was not correlated with any of the weather variables we measured. These results suggest that predation influences fundamental aspects of the biology and ecology of insectivorous bats by determining when it is safe to become active.",

The geographic origin of the holotype of N. stramineus, however, has never been known with certainty, confounding discussions concerning the species limits, nomenclature, and biogeography of this genus. The type locality of N. stramineus was assumed to be Brazil for about 80 years, but was later transferred to the Lesser Antilles. Although the later view has dominated the taxonomy of Natalus for the past four decades, there have been recent claims that the type locality might indeed be in Brazil. In this study, I provide morphological evidence that corroborates the Lesser Antillean origin of the holotype of N. stramineus. In addition, I argue that N. stramineus-like populations do not occur in northern South America implying that the genus Natalus is distributed throughout Central and South America as three allopatric taxa. The findings presented here prompt the recognition of two additional species for the continental Neotropics and put and end to lingering confusion about the degree of sympatry, or lack thereof, among these species. Finally, I summarize the available information about the natural history of N. stramineus, as herein restricted, and argue that the current distribution of the species is likely the result of ancestral dispersal from northern South America.",

Four different data sets were analysed: (1) 23 landmarks and (2) 26 landmarks on the dorsal and ventral sides of the cranium, respectively, (3) 49 landmarks on the upper jaw, and (4) 34 landmarks on the labial side of the mandible. For almost all data sets, when compared within sex groups, P. pipistrellus were significantly larger than P. pygmaeus; the biggest difference being observed in the mandible size. Interspecific differences in shape, analysed by Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) of the Procrustes superimposed landmarks, were also mostly visible in the mandible, and were related to dietary differences between the species. For example, the longer and more upright canines of P. pipistrellus allow them to pierce harder prey, the bigger molars ease its processing, and the shortened body of the mandible and the more developed coronoid process presumably generate a stronger bite. The shape and size of the mandible proved to be a good characteristic for distinguishing both cryptic taxa. A procedure for estimating missing landmarks for 3D geometric morphometric purposes was created. Our procedure of finding the missing landmarks had no effect on the within-group loss of variation. DFA of data sets with reconstructed versus orginal (but reduced) landmarks yielded similar results (three versus two misclassified specimens in leave-one-out cross-validation).",

We quantified the density of potential roost cavities in three age classes (i.e., young: ca. 20 years, mature: ca. 60 years, and old: ca. 100 years) of riparian cottonwood (Populus deltoides) forest stands. Bat activity was also sampled using acoustic detectors in one representative stand of each age class. Stands were situated along an 80 km stretch of the Missouri River in southeastern South Dakota and northwestern Iowa, USA. We predicted the highest density of potential roosts and the highest activity of bats to occur in the oldest age class. Contrary to our predictions, and previous work in aspen dominated upland sites, we found that the density of potential roosts was not significantly different between mature and old stands. However, there were no potential roosts in young stands. Data from guano traps verified the use of a number of cavities in both mature and old stands. Both commuting and foraging activities were highest in the mature, relative to the old and young stand. In total, our data indicate that mature and old stands represent high quality roosting habitat, with the mature being used preferentially for commuting and foraging. Trees in the oldest stands, however, are nearing the end of their lifespan and falling. Younger cohorts must therefore be retained for future recruitment of natural cavities.",

However, their correct application requires the development of robust and reliable identification procedures. Little information is available on the bats of Madeira Island (Portugal), particularly their ecological requirements, distribution and population trends, and proper guidelines for their monitoring and conservation have yet to be defined. In this study, we present the first analysis of echolocation calls from species occurring on the island to provide a tool for bat identification during acoustic surveys. Seven hundred and ninety one time-expanded recordings of search phase echolocation calls in cluttered and uncluttered habitats of the Macaronesia endemic pipistrelle Pipistrellus maderensis, Madeira Leisler’s bat Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus and grey long-eared bat Plecotus austriacus were analysed and an acoustic repertoire with their temporal and spectral features is described. Pipistrellus maderensis was easily identified based only on peak frequency while Plecotus austriacus and N. leisleri verrucosus showed frequency overlap in cluttered backgrounds. Discriminant function analysis was applied to calls of Plecotus austriacus and N. l. verrucosus resulting in a correct overall classification of 96.7% of calls, with a function based on start frequency, end frequency, duration and interpulse interval. This work provides the first description of Pipistrellus maderensis and N. l. verrucosus echolocation calls and offers a basis for future bat surveys in order to encourage the development of locally customized conservation strategies.",

The mean number (± SE) of individual C. sphinx captured by mist net were 2.2 ± 0.33/day and 1.4 ± 0.32/day in the rainy season (September to October) and dry season (November to December), respectively; the difference was not significant. The number of seed pellets expelled was 9.0 ± 1.12/day and 7.2 ± 1.37/day in the rainy and dry seasons respectively; again the difference was not significant. The removal curves for marked fruit were similar for 10 focal trees. Fruits were consumed heavily within two weeks after ripening and all the marked fruit were removed within one month. The difference in seed dispersal was significant between different feeding roosts indicating that patterns of seed dispersal may not be uniform. We found the seeds of M. acuminata can be dispersed by C. sphinx to a distance of about 200 m, and C. sphinx can be considered as an effective seed disperser of M. acuminata.",

            "abstractNote": "Borneo has a significant role to play in the conservation of bat diversity in Southeast Asia, yet there is little taxonomic and distribution information available for the Indonesian states that represent over two thirds of the island. We report the results of a four week harp-trap and mist-net survey of four limestone karst formations on the Sangkulirang peninsula in East Kalimantan during August 2004. We recorded 36 taxa, including two (a Pipistrellus and Rhinolophus) that may represent new species, and three (Hipposideros bicolor, Myotis horsfieldii and M. montivagus) that are new records for Kalimantan. Several species, including the karst dependent and patchily distributed Hipposideros larvatus, Rhinolophus creaghi and R. pusillus, were highly abundant at the formations. In Borneo, many of the species were previously known from only a few, or scattered, localities including four Red-Listed species (R. creaghi, M. montivagus, Murina rozendaali and Kerivoula minuta). We review the Bornean distributions of individual species given recent surveys in Kalimantan and present taxonomic data from 135 specimens collected during this study. This represents the largest bat collection in Kalimantan so far undertaken and highlights the Sangkulirang peninsula as a key site for bat diversity and conservation in Borneo. Threats to this area include disturbance from bird nest collection in caves, but also mass disturbance from logging and forest fires. We advocate inclusion of the formations and associated forests into a protected area to safeguard this biological resource.",

Consistent with the bimodal distribution of body sizes of R. macrotis specimens obtained from the same cave, we now consider this population to be comprised of two putative species; a large and a small form, with dominant echolocation call frequencies of 49 kHz and 65 kHz, respectively. Cytochrome b sequences of these two phonic forms diverged by 3.16–3.25%, a similar level of divergence to that between the large form and the outgroup, R. rex (3.33–3.77%). These differences strongly suggest that the two phonic forms are distinct species. We also found that the wing loading and aspect ratio of the small form was much lower than that of the large form, suggesting that the small form is capable of foraging in denser forest. Without dietary evidence, the ecological significance of the observed difference in echolocation call frequency between the two forms (16 kHz) remains unknown.",

In south-western Germany (federal state of Baden-Württemberg), only four nursery roosts of M. emarginatus are known. Referring to the trophic niche of this species and to own observations, we hypothezied that cowsheds are important foraging areas for M. emarginatus in Central Europe. This would have important implications for the conservation of this species. To test this hypothesis we conducted a diet analysis aiming at three major aspects: the trophic niche, indications for foraging habitats used, and the importance of these foraging habitats throughout the nursery season. Flies (Brachycera) made up the largest volume in the diet of M. emarginatus throughout the season, followed by spiders (Araneida) and butterflies (Lepidoptera). Among the flies, the genus Musca and the species Stomoxys calcitrans were found in more than half of the investigated faecal pellets. Both of these fly-taxa are strongly related to cattle farming. Therefore we conclude that the individuals of the investigated colony of M. emarginatus were mainly hunting in the vicinity of cattle farms during the whole nursery season. Consequently, the preservation of traditional cattle farming is likely to play a key role for the conservation of M. emarginatus in Central Europe.",

            "abstractNote": "In many bat species, average body size of females is larger than males. One common explanation is that larger females exhibit greater reproductive success. One avenue whereby increased size could positively affect fitness is by improving aerodynamic performance. We examined secondary sexual size dimorphism in wing elements of Artibeus lituratus. In particular we examined absolute differences, relative differences after controlling for disparities in body size, and differences in the degree of morphological integration of wing elements. Females were absolutely and relatively larger than males in many wing elements and exhibited no difference in morphological integration. Absolute and relative differences in size of wing elements are likely related to enhanced aerodynamic performance in females, especially related to weight gain during reproduction. Future studies should examine patterns of dimorphism across the geographic distribution of this species to better understand the particular ecological and environmental context in which such size differences manifest.",

            "abstractNote": "The genus Myotis is comprised of about 100 species that are unequally distributed between the Northern (81% of the species) and the Southern hemisphere (19% of the species). Only eight species of Myotis occur in the Ethiopian region, but this is the only biogeographic region with representatives of all four classical subgenera, suggesting a diverse assemblage of morphotypes. We used sequences of a mitochondrial DNA gene (cyt b) to investigate the evolution and the phylogenetic position of seven of the eight Ethiopian species, and compared them to a broad sampling of Myotis from the World and of other vespertilionids. Phylogenetic reconstruction was based on 91 complete sequences representing 79 species of bats. The two endemic southern African species of the subgenus Cistugo were not placed within the genus Myotis, but were basal to the vespertilionid radiation, as suggested by earlier work based on karyology. The remaining Ethiopian species formed a strong monophyletic clade within Myotis, further stressing the importance of biogeography as a good predictor of phylogenetic relationships. This Ethiopian clade includes one Western Palaearctic and one Oriental species, both of which probably secondarily colonized these areas from the Ethiopian region. Molecular dating based on Bayesian inferences suggest that these faunal exchanges occurred at the end of the Miocene, while the split of the Ethiopian clade from the other Old World Myotis dates back to the middle Miocene, quite early in the Myotis radiation. Thus, the relative paucity of species in sub-Saharan Africa cannot be attributed to a late entry into this continent. Instead, these molecular results suggest that other evolutionary processes are responsible for the poor species diversity of Myotis found in Africa today.",

            "abstractNote": "We investigated roost selection by Leisler’s bat (Nyctalus leisleri) before and after hibernation in 2005 in a mountain area of southern Switzerland. The study area is dominated by deciduous trees and characterised by the presence of previously managed chestnut (Castanea sativa) orchards that are now partly abandoned. In March–May and August–October, 15 radio-tracked bats (seven males and eight females) used 28 roost trees. We analysed roosts used by N. leisleri at three different levels: (i) micro-scale: features of roost cavities; (ii) meso-scale: characteristics of selected roost trees and (iii) macro-scale: structure of woodland surrounding roost trees. Selection at meso and macro-scales was obtained comparing characteristics of roost trees and surrounding woodland with potentially available trees and woodlands. Bats roosted mainly in live chestnut trees, with large diameter and absence of vegetation near the entrance. Roost trees were located closer to streams, in woodlands with a higher percentage of sweet chestnut trees and a lower tree density than random trees. Multifunctional forest management in abandoned chestnut stands, comprising recreation (chestnut harvesting) and preservation of a semi-natural habitat and its related biodiversity, would recreate the traditional woodland features – in particular an open forest structure with low tree density and presence of ancient chestnut trees – and provide suitable roosting sites to migratory N. leisleri.",

            "abstractNote": "Vitamin D (represented by D2 or D3) is considered essential for normal calcium homeostasis. It is either synthesized in the skin following ultraviolet-B irradiation of provitamin D3 (7-dehydrocholesterol), or ingested in the diet as vitamin D2 or vitamin D3. Most neotropical bats are nocturnal, roost in dark places, and consume diets that lack vitamin D and thus have no other known source of this important nutrient. A few species, namely fish-eating (piscivores) and blood-eating (sanguivores), however, have the potential to ingest large quantities of dietary vitamin D. In this study, blood serum collected from five nocturnal, neotropical bats (including three plant-visiting species, one fish-eating species and one blood-eating species), was analyzed using a competitive protein binding assay (CPBA) to determine concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the major circulating vitamin D metabolite. Caveroosting (absence of sunlight), plant-visiting species (Artibeus jamaicensis, Brachyphylla cavernarum, and Monophyllus redmani) had a mean serum concentration of 25(OH)D between 7–15 ng/ml, values that are less than sufficient for humans. By contrast, caveroosting, sanguivorous Desmodus rotundus and piscivorous Noctilio leporinus, species which have access to dietary vitamin D, had a mean serum concentration of 25(OH)D between 236–247 ng/ml, with high values to 400 ng/ml, the highest recorded for any vertebrate taxon. These findings support the hypothesis that circulating 25(OH)D concentrations in bats are strongly influenced by dietary habits.",

We describe them as a new species characterised by a relatively long forearm, moderately long ears, flat cranial profile and wide anteorbital bridge. Based on characters classically used to separate the ‘subgenera’ of Myotis the new species shows affinities to both the nominate subgenus ‘Myotis’ and ‘Selysius’. Our morphological investigations support recent phylogenetic analyses showing that the former ‘subgenera’ of Myotis are in fact paraphyletic groups, even within Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, many of the external and craniodental features formerly used to separate these subgenera provide a practical means of grouping species. Using these characters we provide an identification key to identify the new species, as well as other currently recognized medium and large sized, small-footed Myotis species from the Indomalayan Region.",

            "abstractNote": "Species diversity and species limits of the small fruit-eating bats, genus Dermanura (Phyllostomidae: Stenodermatinae) were examined. Estimates of species diversity based on classical morphological criteria (current taxonomy) were compared to diversity estimates based on monophyly and cytochrome-b sequence divergence. The most recent taxonomic list included nine species, whereas the genetic based list contained 11: anderseni, azteca, bogotensis, cinerea, glauca, gnoma, phaeotis, rava, rosenbergi, tolteca, and watsoni, of which three (bogotensis Andersen, rava Miller, and rosenbergi Thomas) have been considered synonyms of cinerea, glauca, phaeotis, and tolteca by previous authors. In addition, we consider incomitata to be a synonym of watsoni. Phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA sequences resolved the interrelationships among taxa and prompted us to re-evaluate some morphological characters that support the distinction of all the recognized taxa, therefore providing a robust estimate of species status. A phylogenetic tree revealed a geographic component to the diversification of Dermanura, including a historical connection between western Andean and Middle American biota. In South America, no species has been recorded from both sides of the Andes Mountains, and at least one clade (glauca, gnoma, and bogotensis) is restricted to the eastern versant of the Andes. Using genetic data (monophyly and genetic distance) to identify species we were able to produce testable genealogical and biogeographic hypotheses to facilitate further studies.",

It is recorded from Cambodia for the first time. Rhinolophus malayanus exhibits considerable geographical variation in echolocation calls, with apparently two phonic types: a northern population with lower frequency calls and a predominantly southern population with higher frequencies. However, this acoustic divergence is not reflected in any morphometric divergence, and the taxonomic status of the two phonic populations remains unclear. Discriminating characters of all three species are given, together with distribution data and short ecological summaries. The value of echolocation as an indicator of cryptic species and the zoogeographical implications of the study are briefly discussed.",

Subsequently however, it was recognised that this taxon was in fact a complex of species. As such, in 2012, two larger forms were recognised as separate and distinct species, namely: M. peninsularis in the Sunda region and M. fionae in Laos and Vietnam. In the current paper, a new cryptic species of the cyclotis-complex is described from peninsular Thailand based on a combination of external, craniodental and genetic differences. In addition, the population previously referred to M. cyclotis from the Nicobar Islands is described as a new subspecies of this new species. Despite this work and the research of others, the taxonomy of M. cyclotis still requires further study. The description of M. peninsularis is emended and the extensive variation in its morphological characters is addressed. The diagnostic characters of each taxon, as well as the additional data on ecology, zoogeography, distribution, echolocation and genetics, where available, are summarised and discussed.",

In September, 2007, two individuals were collected in lower montane forest, which included some mixed deciduous forest, bamboo groves and banana trees, in the hills of Phu Suan Sai National Park, Loei Province, and a single individual was collected in mixed deciduous forest, near bamboo, in the Nam Nao National Park, Petchabun Province, Thailand. In 1996–1998, seven specimens were collected from five localities in north, central and southern Lao PDR; most were associated with evergreen forest at altitudes between 150–800 m a.s.l. The species appears to be relatively widespread in continental Southeast Asia. Locally common, it is probably not currently at risk.",

            "abstractNote": "Management of derelict mines to improve subterranean bat habitat and minimise safety risks to the unsuspecting public is occurring more frequently. Many caves and mines around the world have had gates placed at mine and cave entrances as a means of maintaining bat habitat and preventing human access, but there have been few replicated experiments to test their effectiveness. We experimentally tested a staged installation of a template gate at two mines while monitoring another two un-gated derelict mines in southeastern Australia. We recorded changes in numbers, behaviour and the relative species abundance of two bat species (Rhinolophus megaphyllus and Miniopterus schreibersii) before and after the gates were installed. The template gate (20 mm diameter plastic tubing) was installed in three stages, with the initial horizontal bar spacing at 450 mm, followed by a spacing of 300 mm and a final spacing of 125 mm. Bat numbers and behaviour were largely unaffected by bar spacings of 450 mm and 300 mm. The major findings were that immediately after the installation of bars at the final spacing (125 mm gap), numbers of bats declined significantly and a significant increase in the number of aborted exit and entry flights was observed. Detectors proved to be inadequate at quantifying changes in the relative abundance of species. Eleven days after the final installation there were no significant differences between the numbers of bats leaving gated and control mines, suggesting bats had learnt to negotiate the bars after a short period of time. However, flight behaviour was still affected after habituation, especially baulking at the structure when bats attempted to re-enter before dawn. The low replication of mines in the experiment warrants caution in extrapolating this result. Until further gating experiments are carried-out, we recommend site specific monitoring whenever mines are gated.",

We observed the number of visits made by C. sphinx to four species of commercial fruits in orchards (Mangifera indica, Achras sapota, Psidium guajava and Vitis vinifera), and four species of wild/non-commercial fruits (Muntingia calabura, Ficus bengalensis, F. religiosa and Bassia latifolia) in suburban areas. The total number of bat visits to M. calabura was significantly greater than to all other fruit species. The range of percentages of total nightly bat visits was from as low as 5% (V. vinifera) to 47% (F. religiosa), in comparison to the total nightly visits made to M. calabura. In addition, the number of mist-netted individuals of C. sphinx per hour near M. calabura was also significantly higher than near other fruit species. We suggest that if M. calabura is grown in and around orchards, damage caused by C. sphinx to commercial fruit crops may be decreased and therefore would serve as a non-destructive method for managing removal of commercial fruits by bats.",

The inference based on molecular phylogenetics methods shows that these two morphotypes correspond to two mitochondrial groups within the Iberian Peninsula. Our results also support the model of ‘refugia within refugia’, where M. d. daubentonii has spread north and M. d. nathalinae has became an Iberian endemism. The haplotype network indicates haplotype sharing between Monfurado and S. Mamede (Portugal) and Bavaria (Germany), demonstrating current or recent dispersal and gene flow between these populations. Myotis d. nathalinae displays a substructure showing that populations under the same climate type are more related. As a distinct Iberian endemism, the conservation status of M. d. nathalinae should be reviewed.",

The volume of data generated in surveys necessitates automated call detection, either in real time via a triggering function or offline, yet researchers are hesitant to replace traditional hand analysis without a thorough understanding of the accuracy and costs of automated detection. We compared detection accuracy and computational cost of the underlying algorithms used in commercial detectors (a zero-crossing detector, a spectral peak detector, and a high-band energy detector) with a model-based analysis method called the links detector. We predicted that the links detector would be more accurate than the other detectors, producing a larger effective detection range, because the links detector uses more information to make detection decisions. We also predicted that the links detector would be the most computationally expensive algorithm because of the processing needed for the extra information. We quantified the performance of the detectors using a synthetic recording environment, which provided an absolute ground truth for the experiments and allowed us to measure the effective detection range of each algorithm. The zero-crossing and high-band energy detectors, the fastest, were about 40 times faster than the links detector. Most of the computational cost was attributed to the filter used to remove low-frequency noise. The links detector, the most accurate, increased effective detection range by 6–12 m compared to the other detectors depending on species. The results will allow bat researchers to better understand the costs and benefits of automated detection methods.",

            "abstractNote": "Horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) use echolocation calls with a prominent part whose frequency is constant over time (CF) and matches the ‘acoustic fovea’ of the bats’ hearing system. The present study on European Rhinolophus species investigates whether this CF component contains reliable information on species, sex, age class or quality (size and body condition) of the caller and could therefore have a communicative value. The resting frequencies (RF) were measured from stationary, handheld bats for the species Rhinolophus blasii, R. euryale, R. mehelyi and R. hipposideros (the latter with very low sample size) in Bulgaria, where they occur in sympatry. We recorded calls directly onto a laptop computer and used a specially designed analysis algorithm to achieve high and accurate frequency resolution. After silent periods, individuals ‘tuned in’ to their RFs always from lower frequencies, corroborating the recent finding that frequencies below RF might be used for auditory feedback control as well. Rhinolophus blasii could reliably be separated from its congeners by RF, while R. mehelyi overlapped strongly with both R. euryale and R. hipposideros. Only R. blasii showed sex and age differences in RF, albeit the overlap was large. Adult female R. blasii had higher RFs than both adult males and juvenile females. In R. blasii, RF was positively correlated with forearm length, body mass and body condition index; in R. mehelyi with body mass and body condition index. However, there was no correlation between RF and these body size parameters within a sex or age class for any of the species, suggesting that RF is not a reliable honest signal for intraspecific communication that would indicate the quality of a potential mate or competitor.",

            "abstractNote": "The pteropodid fruit bat genus Eidolon is comprised of two extant species: E. dupreanum on Madagascar and E. helvum on the African mainland and offshore islands. Recent population genetic studies of E. helvum indicate widespread panmixia across the continent, although island populations off western Africa show genetic structure. Little is known about the genetic connectivity of E. dupreanum or the divergence time between these two sister species. We examine sequence data for one mitochondrial (cyt-b) and three nuclear regions (β-fib, RAG1, and RAG2) to assess population genetic structure within E. dupreanum and divergence between the two Eidolon spp. In addition, we characterize the demographic history of both taxa using coalescent-based methods. We find little evidence for population structure within E. dupreanum, and suggest that this reflects dispersal based on seasonal fruit availability and a preference for roosting sites in exposed rock outcrops. However, despite apparent panmixia in both Eidolon spp. and large dispersal distances reported in previous studies for E. helvum, these two taxa diverged in the mid-to-late Miocene. Both species are also characterized by population expansion and young, Pleistocene clade ages, although slower population growth in E. dupreanum is likely explained by its divergence via colonization from the mainland. Finally, we discuss the implications of population connectivity in E. dupreanum in the context of its potential role as a reservoir host for pathogens capable of infecting humans.",

As in other parts of Southeast Asia, cave roosting bats in the Philippines have suffered extensive human disturbance, and as a result, may be declining. Here we contributed to a region-wide effort to assess the status of cave bats by surveying bats in well-known caves and forest on limestone on Bohol Island in the central Philippines. We also assessed cave disturbance through physical signs and interviews. We observed and acoustically detected bats representing a total of 14 taxa in 23 of the 25 caves surveyed. Few species were present in most caves (median = 2 spp.) and only three caves had large numbers of bats (> 1,000). However, of the 29 bat species captured in forest, 19 are known to roost in caves, including the poorly known Philippine endemic, Hipposideros coronatus. Most surveyed caves experienced either current or historical human disturbance (88%), primarily by collectors of edible bird’s nests, bats for food, and guano for use as fertilizer in rice fields. High species richness, signs of population decline, and high human disturbance all point to Bohol Island as an important conservation area for cave-roosting bats in the Philippines.",

Paraffin sections were stained with DBA-lectin binding, Bowie and fluorescent anti-H+/K+ATPase α-subunit immunostaining to detect the chief and parietal cells in the gastric mucosa. The stomach of the bat presents a short cardias, a wide fundus and a small pylorus. Chief and parietal cells were found in the fundic glands and their number varied from the oral to the aboral region of fundus. In the oral region several chief cells with Bowie-positive pepsinogen granules were observed in the basal part of glands, whereas parietal cells positive to DBA-lectin binding and immuroreactive with anti-H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit were concentrated in the the upper part of the glands. In the aboral fundus chief cells were lacking, whereas the number of parietal cells increased and they were distributed along the glands. A gradient of pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid secretion similar to that found in some non-mammals can be hypothesised. The possibility that this gradient is the ancestral condition in Chiroptera and Eutheria and its functional meaning are discussed.",

Documentation of the impact of such anthropogenic disturbance is essential for effective management. We re-sampled bats within Mount Isarog Natural Park (MINP), a protected area in southeastern Luzon, Philippines, seventeen years after a survey in old- and second-growth forest and in agro-pastoral areas was conducted in 1988. By employing harp traps and a tunnel trap, in addition to mist nets as used in the earlier study, we aimed to document species previously undetected by mist netting alone. We documented 26 bat species, seven of which were captured exclusively in harp traps, and two that were only captured in a tunnel trap. This survey resulted in nine new records of bat species for MINP, bringing the total number to 30. We did not recapture four species documented in 1988, all of which were noted in that study as uncommon. Nineteen species were captured in agro-pastoral areas on the south slope, including two Hipposideros spp. not captured at the forested sites.",

This concern has driven interest in estimating population-level changes. Mark-recapture methodology is one possible analytical framework for assessing bat population changes, but sample size requirements to produce reliable estimates have not been estimated. To illustrate the sample sizes necessary for a mark-recapture-based monitoring program we conducted power analyses using a statistical model that allows reencounters of live and dead marked individuals. We ran 1,000 simulations for each of five broad sample size categories in a Burnham joint model, and then compared the proportion of simulations in which 95% confidence intervals overlapped between and among years for a 4-year study. Additionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses of sample size to various capture probabilities and recovery probabilities. More than 50,000 individuals per year would need to be captured and released to accurately determine 10% and 15% declines in annual survival. To detect more dramatic declines of 33% or 50% survival over four years, then sample sizes of 25,000 or 10,000 per year, respectively, would be sufficient. Sensitivity analyses reveal that increasing recovery of dead marked individuals may be more valuable than increasing capture probability of marked individuals. Because of the extraordinary effort that would be required, we advise caution should such a mark-recapture effort be initiated because of the difficulty in attaining reliable estimates. We make recommendations for what techniques show the most promise for mark-recapture studies of bats because some techniques violate the assumptions of mark-recapture methodology when used to mark bats.",

Mothers and young produced tonal (structured change in frequency over time) frequency-modulated (FM) signals with varying harmonic components in situations ranging from reunion to just before nursing. Pups left by their mothers were usually silent, only occasionally producing tonal isolation calls. Adult females used FM signals in stressful situations, times when young usually produced clicks. Vibrational signals (‘hums’) composed of clicks (broadband, no structured change in frequency over time) characterized pup-pup and mother-pup interactions but pups also used other clicks that differed in frequency components from clicks comprising the hums. In stressful situations, adults produced FM signals, the pups, clicks. FM signals of pups decreased in frequencies with increasing age (size). Echolocation calls of adults and subadults hunting flying prey differed in frequency components. Differences in duration of echolocation calls coincided with setting (short calls in flight cages, open calls in the open). FM signals produced by pups searching for their mothers’ nipples showed little potential for individual signatures. Calls and calling behaviour of eastern red bats that are solitary and foliage-roosting, differed from those of more gregarious species roosting in more sheltered situations.",

Faecal pellets were collected individually and arthropod fragments identified to family level, where possible. Arthropod availability was assessed using Malaise traps. Selection analyses were performed using Compositional Analysis and a Chi-square goodness-of-fit test. The bulk of the diet of R. mehelyi consisted of Lepidoptera, representing more than the 80% of the consumed volume on average (excluding juveniles), and more than 90% of the average percentage occurrence. This pattern was consistent across localities. Neuroptera and Tipulidae were locally abundant. Other important prey categories were Chrysomelidae, Brachycera, and Chironomidae. ANOVA tests showed that there were no significant differences between males and females in consumed prey categories, whereas juveniles consumed significantly less Lepidoptera than adults. Lepidoptera was the first prey category in the preference rank, followed by Myrmeleontidae, Chrysopidae and Tipulidae, and all of these were consumed more than expected by chance. This work shows that R. mehelyi is a moth specialist and suggests that juveniles may acquire this strategy while gaining hunting experience. Given the similarities in echolocation call characteristics and diet in the sibling R. mehelyi and R. euryale, they may compete for trophic resources in sympatry. Nevertheless, subtle differences in wing morphology between both species are probably large enough to permit spatial resource partitioning.",

Their origin and evolution is largely unknown because of the nature of the fossil record; the deepest well-dated glimpse of Madagascar’s mammal groups comes from only 26,000 years ago. Bat remains have frequently been recovered from paleontological sites, but have been rarely identified or described. It therefore remains unknown whether bats underwent a reduction in species diversity similar to that seen in many of Madagascar’s vertebrate clades. Herein I describe a collection of newly discovered subfossil bats from Anjohibe Cave, northwestern Madagascar, some estimated to have been deposited about 80,000 years ago. Five bat genera are represented as subfossil (Rousettus, Eidolon, Hipposideros, Triaenops, and Myotis) with four of these genera present in Anjohibe Cave today. The subfossil material has yielded two new species, indicating that Malagasy bats experienced recent species turnover, paralleling what is seen in much of the island’s terrestrial vertebrate fauna.",
