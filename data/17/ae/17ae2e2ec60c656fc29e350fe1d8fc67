            "abstractNote": "Lyssaviruses are an important genus of zoonotic viruses which cause the disease rabies. The United Kingdom is free of classical rabies (RABV). However, bat rabies due to European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2), has been detected in Daubenton’s bats (Myotis daubentonii) in Great Britain since 1996, including a fatal human case in Scotland in 2002. Across Europe, European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1) is commonly associated with serotine bats (Eptesicus serotinus). Despite the presence of serotine bats across large parts of southern England, EBLV-1 had not previously been detected in this population. However, in 2018, EBLV-1 was detected through passive surveillance in a serotine bat from Dorset, England, using a combination of fluorescent antibody test, reverse transcription-PCR, Sanger sequencing and immunohistochemical analysis. Subsequent EBLV-1 positive serotine bats have been identified in South West England, again through passive surveillance, during 2018, 2019 and 2020. Here, we confirm details of seven cases of EBLV-1 and present similarities in genetic sequence indicating that emergence of EBLV-1 is likely to be recent, potentially associated with the natural movement of bats from the near continent",

The bat is considered a source of noticeable viruses resulting in human and livestock infections, especially the coronavirus. Therefore, surveillance and genetic analysis of coronaviruses in bats are essential in order to prevent the risk of future diseases. In this study, the genome of HCQD-2020, a novel alphacoronavirus detected in a bat (Eptesicus serotinus), was assembled and described using nextgeneration sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. The comparison of the whole-genome sequence and the conserved amino acid sequence of replicated proteins revealed that the new strain was distantly related with other known species in the Alphacoronavirus genus. Phylogenetic construction indicated that this strain formed a separated branch with other species, suggesting a new species of Alphacoronavirus. Additionally, in silico prediction also revealed the risk of cross-species infection of this strain, especially in the order Artiodactyla. In summary, this study provided the genetic characteristics of a possible new species belonging to Alphacoronavirus.",

Recently, African fruit bats with populations that roost in or near urban areas have been shown to harbour a great diversity of paramyxoviruses, posing potential spillover risks to public health. Understanding the circulation of these viruses in their reservoir populations is essential to predict and prevent future emerging diseases. Here, we identify a high incidence of multiple paramyxoviruses in urine samples collected from a closed captive colony of circa 115 straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum). The sequences detected have high nucleotide identities with those derived from free ranging African fruit bats and form phylogenetic clusters with the Henipavirus genus, Pararubulavirus genus and other unclassiﬁed paramyxoviruses. As this colony had been closed for 5 years prior to this study, these results indicate that within-host paramyxoviral persistence underlies the role of bats as reservoirs of these viruses.",

            "abstractNote": "Inﬂuenza A viruses (IAV) of subtype H9N2, endemic in world-wide poultry holdings, are reported to cause spill-over infections to pigs and humans and have also contributed substantially to recent reassortment-derived pre-pandemic zoonotic viruses of concern, such as the Asian H7N9 viruses. Recently, a H9N2 bat inﬂuenza A virus was found in Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), raising the question of whether this bat species is a suitable host for IAV. Here, we studied the susceptibility, pathogenesis and transmission of avian and bat-related H9N2 viruses in this new host. In a ﬁrst experiment, we oronasally inoculated six Egyptian fruit bats with an avian-related H9N2 virus (A/layer chicken/Bangladesh/VP02-plaque/2016 (H9N2)). In a second experiment, six Egyptian fruit bats were inoculated with the newly discovered bat-related H9N2 virus (A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017 (H9N2)). While R. aegyptiacus turned out to be refractory to an infection with H9N2 avian-type, inoculation with the bat H9N2 subtype established a productive infection in all inoculated animals with a detectable seroconversion at day 21 post-infection. In conclusion, Egyptian fruit bats are most likely not susceptible to the avian H9N2 subtype, but can be infected with fruit bat-derived H9N2. H9-speciﬁc sero-reactivities in fruit bats in the ﬁeld are therefore more likely the result of contact with a bat-adapted H9N2 strain.",

            "abstractNote": "The straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa and is widely hunted for bushmeat. It is known to harbour a range of paramyxoviruses, including rubuloviruses and henipaviruses, but the zoonotic potential of these is unknown. We previously found a diversity of paramyxoviruses within a small, captive colony of E. helvum after it had been closed to contact with other bats for 5 years. In this study, we used under-roost urine collection to further investigate the paramyxovirus diversity and ecology in this colony, which had been closed to the outside for 10 years at the time of sampling. By sampling urine weekly throughout an entire year, we investigated possible seasonal patterns of shedding of virus or viral RNA. Using a generic paramyxovirus L-gene PCR, we detected eight distinct paramyxovirus RNA sequences. Six distinct sequences were detected using a Henipavirus-speciﬁc PCR that targeted a different region of the L-gene. Sequence detection had a bi-annual pattern, with the greatest peak in July, although different RNA sequences appeared to have different shedding patterns. No signiﬁcant associations were detected between sequence detection and birthing season, environmental temperature or humidity, and no signs of illness were detected in any of the bats in the colony during the period of sample collection.",

In addition, they are the natural reservoirs of a variety of emerging or re-emerging zoonotic pathogens. Rhabdoviridae is one of the most diverse families of RNA viruses, which consists of 20 ecologically diverse genera, infecting plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, and ﬁsh. To date, three bat-related genera are described, named Lyssavirus, Vesiculovirus, and Ledantevirus. However, the prevalence and the distribution of these bat-related rhabdoviruses remain largely unknown, especially in China. To ﬁll this gap, we performed a large molecular retrospective study based on the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of lyssavirus in bat samples (1044 brain and 3532 saliva samples, from 63 different bat species) originating from 21 provinces of China during 2006–2018. None of them were positive for lyssavirus, but six bat brains (0.6%) of Rhinolophus bat species, originating from Hubei and Hainan provinces, were positive for vesiculoviruses or ledanteviruses. Based on complete genomes, these viruses were phylogenetically classiﬁed into three putative new species, tentatively named Yinshui bat virus (YSBV), Taiyi bat virus (TYBV), and Qiongzhong bat virus (QZBV). These results indicate the novel rhabdoviruses circulated in different Chinese bat populations.",

They comprise several important pathogens like classical swine fever virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus that induce economically important animal diseases. In 2017, the last update of pestivirus taxonomy resulted in demarcation of 11 species designated Pestivirus A through Pestivirus K. Since then, multiple new pestiviruses have been reported including pathogens associated with disease in pigs or small ruminants. In addition, pestivirus sequences have been found during metagenomics analysis of different non-ungulate hosts (bats, rodents, whale, and pangolin), but the consequences of this pestivirus diversity for animal health still need to be established. To provide a systematic classiﬁcation of the newly discovered viruses, we analyzed the genetic relationship based on complete coding sequences (cds) and deduced polyprotein sequences and calculated pairwise distances that allow species demarcation. In addition, phylogenetic analysis was performed based on a highly conserved region within the non-structural protein NS5B. Taking into account the genetic relationships observed together with available information about antigenic properties, host origin, and characteristics of disease, we propose to expand the number of pestivirus species to 19 by adding eight additional species designated Pestivirus L through Pestivirus S.",

            "abstractNote": "Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to characterize viral diversity in bats from China. Many of these studies were prospective and focused mainly on Rhinolophus bats that could be related to zoonotic events. However, other species of bats that are part of ecosystems identiﬁed as virus diversity hotspots have not been studied in-depth. We analyzed the virome of a group of Myotis ﬁmbriatus bats collected from the Yunnan Province during 2020. The virome of M. ﬁmbriatus revealed the presence of families of pathogenic viruses such as Coronavirus, Astrovirus, Mastadenovirus, and Picornavirus, among others. The viral sequences identiﬁed in M. ﬁmbriatus were characterized by signiﬁcant divergence from other known viral sequences of bat origin. Complex phylogenetic landscapes implying a tendency of co-speciﬁcity and relationships with viruses from other mammals characterize these groups. The most prevalent and abundant virus in M. ﬁmbriatus individuals was an alphacoronavirus. The genome of this virus shows evidence of recombination and is likely the product of ancestral host-switch. The close phylogenetic and ecological relationship of some species of the Myotis genus in China may have played an important role in the emergence of this alphacoronavirus.",

            "abstractNote": "Arboviruses have two ecological transmission cycles: sylvatic and urban. For some, the sylvatic cycle has not been thoroughly described in America. To study the role of wildlife in a putative sylvatic cycle, we sampled free-ranging bats and birds in two arbovirus endemic locations and analyzed them using molecular, serological, and histological methods. No current infection was detected, and no signiﬁcant arbovirus-associated histological changes were observed. Neutralizing antibodies were detected against selected arboviruses. In bats, positivity in 34.95% for DENV-1, 16.26% for DENV-2, 5.69% for DENV-3, 4.87% for DENV-4, 2.43% for WNV, 4.87% for SLEV, 0.81% for YFV, 7.31% for EEEV, and 0.81% for VEEV was found. Antibodies against ZIKV were not detected. In birds, PRNT results were positive against WNV in 0.80%, SLEV in 5.64%, EEEV in 8.4%, and VEEV in 5.63%. An additional retrospective PRNT analysis was performed using bat samples from three additional DENV endemic sites resulting in a 3.27% prevalence for WNV and 1.63% for SLEV. Interestingly, one sample resulted unequivocally WNV positive conﬁrmed by serum titration. These results suggest that free-ranging bats and birds are exposed to not currently reported hyperendemic-human infecting Flavivirus and Alphavirus; however, their role as reservoirs or hosts is still undetermined.",

Methods: We carried out a longitudinal survey from August 2020 to July 2021 at two sites in Zimbabwe with bat–human interactions: Magweto cave and Chirundu farm. A total of 1732 and 1866 individual bat fecal samples were collected, respectively. Coronaviruses and bat species were ampliﬁed using PCR systems. Results: Analysis of the coronavirus sequences revealed a high genetic diversity, and we identiﬁed different sub-viral groups in the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genus. The established sub-viral groups fell within the described Alphacoronavirus sub-genera: Decacovirus, Duvinacovirus, Rhinacovirus, Setracovirus and Minunacovirus and for Betacoronavirus sub-genera: Sarbecoviruses, Merbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Our results showed an overall proportion for CoV positive PCR tests of 23.7% at Chirundu site and 16.5% and 38.9% at Magweto site for insectivorous bats and Macronycteris gigas, respectively. Conclusions: The higher risk of bat coronavirus exposure for humans was found in December to March in relation to higher viral shedding peaks of coronaviruses in the parturition, lactation and weaning months of the bat populations at both sites. We also highlight the need to further document viral infectious risk in human/domestic animal populations surrounding bat habitats in Zimbabwe.",

            "abstractNote": "Increasing amounts of data indicate that bats harbor a higher viral diversity relative to other mammalian orders, and they have been recognized as potential reservoirs for pathogenic viruses, such as the Hendra, Nipah, Marburg, and SARS-CoV viruses. Here, we present the ﬁrst viral metagenomic analysis of Pipistrellus pygmaeus from Uppsala, Sweden. Total RNA was extracted from the saliva and feces of individual bats and analyzed using Illumina sequencing. The results identiﬁed sequences related to 51 different viral families, including vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant viruses. These viral families include Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Astroviridae, Hepeviridae, Reoviridae, Botourmiaviridae, Lispviridae, Totiviridae, Botoumiaviridae, Parvoviridae, Retroviridae, Adenoviridae, and Partitiviridae, as well as different unclassiﬁed viruses. We further characterized three near full-length genome sequences of bat coronaviruses. A phylogenetic analysis showed that these belonged to alphacoronaviruses with the closest similarity (78–99% at the protein level) to Danish and Finnish bat coronaviruses detected in Pipistrellus and Myotis bats. In addition, the full-length and the near full-length genomes of picornavirus were characterized. These showed the closest similarity (88–94% at the protein level) to bat picornaviruses identiﬁed in Chinese bats. Altogether, the results of this study show that Swedish Pipistrellus bats harbor a great diversity of viruses, some of which are closely related to mammalian viruses. This study expands our knowledge on the bat population virome and improves our understanding of the evolution and transmission of viruses among bats and to other species.",

First insights into the immunity of bats suggest that bats have evolved to possess their own strategies to cope with viral infections. Yet, the molecular details for this innocuous coexistence remain poorly described and bat infection models are the key to unveiling these secrets. In Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), a New World bat species, infection experiments with its (putative) natural viral pathogens Tacaribe virus (TCRV), rabies virus (RABV), and the bat inﬂuenza A virus (IAV) H18N11, have contributed to an accurate, though still incomplete, representation of the bat-imposed immunity. Surprisingly, though many aspects of their innate and adaptive immune responses differ from that of the human immune response, such as a contraction of the IFN locus and reduction in the number of immunoglobulin subclasses, variations could also be observed between Jamaican fruit bats and other bat species.",

This is the mechanism of infection of HIV-1, among other concerning human diseases. Over the past years, it has been shown that two chemokine receptors, CCR2 and CCR5, have been shaped by events of gene conversion in different mammalian lineages, which has been linked to a possible selective advantage against pathogens. Here, by taking advantage of available bat genomes, we present the ﬁrst insight of CCR2 and CCR5 evolution within the Chiroptera order. In total, four independent events of recombination between CCR2 and CCR5 were detected: two in a single species, Miniopterus natalensis; one in two species from the Rhinolophoidea superfamily; and one in four species from the Pteropodidae family. The regions affected by the gene conversions were generally extensive and always encompassed extracellular domains. Overall, we demonstrate that CCR2 and CCR5 have been subject to extensive gene conversion in multiple species of bats. Considering that bats are known to be large reservoirs of virus in nature, these results might indicate that chimeric CCR2-CCR5 genes might grant some bat species a selective advantage against viruses that rely in the extracellular portions of either CCR2 or CCR5 as gateways into the cell.",

            "abstractNote": "The cross-species transmission (CST) of pathogens can have dramatic consequences, as highlighted by recent disease emergence events affecting human, animal and plant health. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors that increase the likelihood of disease agents infecting and establishing in a novel host is therefore an important research area. Previous work across different pathogens, including rabies virus (RABV), found that increased evolutionary distance between hosts reduces the frequency of cross-species transmission and of permanent host shifts. However, whether this effect of host relatedness still holds for transmission among recently diverged hosts is not well understood. We aimed to ask if high host relatedness can still increase the probability of a host shift between more recently diverged hosts, and the importance of this effect relative to ecological predictors. We ﬁrst addressed this question by quantifying the CST frequency of RABV between North American bat species within the genus Myotis, using a multi-decade data set containing 128 nucleoprotein (N) RABV sequences from ten host species. We compared RABV CST frequency within Myotis to the rates of CST between nine genera of North American bat species. We then examined whether host relatedness or host range overlap better explains the frequency of CST seen between Myotis species. We found that at the within genus scale, host range overlap, rather than host relatedness best explains the frequency of CST events. Moreover, we found evidence of CST occurring among a higher proportion of species, and CST more frequently resulting in sustained transmission in the novel host in the Myotis dataset compared to the multi-genus dataset. Our results suggest that among recently diverged species, the ability to infect a novel host is no longer restricted by physiological barriers but instead is limited by physical contact. Our results improve predictions of where future CST events for RABV might occur and clarify the relationship between host divergence and pathogen emergence.",

In this study, a two-step pan-ﬁlovirus SYBR Green real-time PCR assay targeting the nucleoprotein gene was developed for ﬁlovirus surveillance in bats. Synthetic constructs were designed as representatives of nine ﬁlovirus species and used to evaluate the assay. This assay detected all synthetic constructs included with an analytical sensitivity of 3–31.7 copies/reaction and was evaluated against the ﬁeld collected samples. The assay’s performance was similar to a previously published probe based assay for detecting Ebola- and Marburgvirus. The developed pan-ﬁlovirus SYBR Green assay will allow for more affordable and sensitive detection of mammalian ﬁloviruses in bat samples.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are of significant interest as reservoirs for various zoonotic viruses with high diversity. During the past two decades, many herpesviruses have been identified in various bats worldwide by genetic approaches, whereas there have been few reports on the isolation of infectious herpesviruses. Herein, we report the prevalence of herpesvirus infection of bats captured in Zambia and genetic characterization of novel gammaherpesviruses isolated from striped leaf-nosed bats (Macronycteris vittatus). By our PCR screening, herpesvirus DNA polymerase (DPOL) genes were detected in 29.2% (7/24) of Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), 78.1% (82/105) of Macronycteris vittatus, and one Sundevall’s roundleaf bat (Hipposideros caffer) in Zambia. Phylogenetic analyses of the detected partial DPOL genes revealed that the Zambian bat herpesviruses were divided into seven betaherpesvirus groups and five gammaherpesvirus groups. Two infectious strains of a novel gammaherpesvirus, tentatively named Macronycteris gammaherpesvirus 1 (MaGHV1), were successfully isolated from Macronycteris vittatus bats, and their complete genomes were sequenced. The genome of MaGHV1 encoded 79 open reading frames, and phylogenic analyses of the DNA polymerase and glycoprotein B demonstrated that MaGHV1 formed an independent lineage sharing a common origin with other bat-derived gammaherpesviruses. Our findings provide new information regarding the genetic diversity of herpesviruses maintained in African bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Sosuga virus (SOSV), a rare human pathogenic paramyxovirus, was first discovered in 2012 when a person became ill after working in South Sudan and Uganda. During an ecological investigation, several species of bats were sampled and tested for SOSV RNA and only one species, the Egyptian rousette bat (ERBs; Rousettus aegyptiacus), tested positive. Since that time, multiple other species have been sampled and ERBs in Uganda have continued to be the only species of bat positive for SOSV infection. Subsequent studies of ERBs with SOSV demonstrated that ERBs are a competent host for SOSV and shed this infectious virus while exhibiting only minor infectionassociated pathology. Following the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, surveillance efforts focused on discovering reservoirs for zoonotic pathogens resulted in the capture and testing of many bat species. Here, SOSV RNA was detected by qRT-PCR only in ERBs captured in the Moyamba District of Sierra Leone in the central region of the country. These findings represent a substantial range extension from East Africa to West Africa for SOSV, suggesting that this paramyxovirus may occur in ERB populations throughout its sub-Saharan African range.",

            "abstractNote": "Marburg virus (MARV) presents with a hemorrhagic fever in primates but asymptomatically in its known reservoir, the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus, ERB). Understanding the biological mechanisms that explain these differential outcomes could be used to develop efficient therapeutics against MARV disease in humans. Since one of the antiviral mechanisms to control viruses is the humoral response, we hypothesize that the B cell repertoire is unique to primates and contributes to the ERB’s ability to overcome MARV infection. Immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy and light chains undergo DNA rearrangement to generate a diverse repertoire. To be able to study B cell rearrangement, the accurate annotation of the Ig heavy chain (IGH) locus is needed. We implemented three complementary strategies to describe and annotate the IGH locus of ERBs. First, we identified and annotated genes at the IGH locus, utilizing the previously described genome and transcriptome of the ERB our group created in collaboration with the CDC and the University of Boston. Second, we sequenced the specific IgM transcriptome of B cells from ERB peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), to confirm or identify new IGH germline genes. Third, we generated bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries to confirm and improve the layout of the IGH locus. We were able to resolve misassemblies of these regions and identify multiple gene expansions unique to ERBs that may contribute to their ability to generate B cell diversity and control infections. We found an expansion of genes associated with protection from various viruses in humans, differential expression of ERB isotypes across tissues, and two functional IgE genes.",

            "abstractNote": "Around 60 % of all bat species occur in islands, and nearly one in four is an insular endemic. Bats are often the only native terrestrial mammals in oceanic islands, and despite increasing anthropogenic pressures, little is known about the distribution, natural history, and population status of most insular bat populations. The sub-tropical archipelago of Madeira is composed of the volcanic islands of Madeira, Porto Santo, and Desertas and is home to the Macaronesian endemic Pipistrellus maderensis, to the endemic subspecies Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus, and to Plecotus austriacus. Pipistrellus maderensis is known to both Madeira and Porto Santo, whereas the other two species have only been recorded in the former. However, no bats have been recorded in Porto Santo for over 15 years, raising fears that bats are probably extinct in the island. In July 2021, we conducted an island-wide acoustic survey using AudioMoth passive acoustic recorders, leading to the detection of Pipistrellus maderensis in 28 out of the 46 sampling sites (60 %). The species’ activity was strongly associated with artiﬁcial water sources, and genetic samples from six captured individuals revealed that the populations of Pipistrellus maderensis in Porto Santo and Madeira have a close phylogenetic afﬁnity. Furthermore, using DNA metabarcoding, we found that the species feeds on a wide variety of insects, including several economically important pest species and disease vectors. These ﬁndings emphasise the need to target more conservation and research efforts towards extant island bat populations and the potential ecosystem services they provide.",

Predation is typically understood to mean “capture, kill, and eat”. However, none of these aspects had been observed. Moreover, key aspects of bat biology were not taken into account, including that the bat in question was a ﬂightless newborn, the capture of which would require some explanation. We revisit this interesting observation considering both bat and spider ecology.",

The study investigated aspects of the ecology of the small mammals, which are known indicators of habitat (environmental) quality. The methodology involved live-trapping of the terrestrial small mammals (rodents and insectivores) using collapsible Sherman traps (for smaller species) and National (Tomahawk) traps (for larger species). Bats were also live-trapped using mist nets at Muni-Pomadze only. A total of 11 species of small mammals were recorded at Muni-Pomadze, comprising 47 individuals of seven rodent species, four individuals of two insectivore species and two individuals of two bat species. Four species were recorded at Keta, made up of three individuals of two species of insectivores and eight individuals of two rodent species. Generally, majority of all the adult individuals captured at Muni-Pomadze were in reproductive condition. At Keta, most of the captures were sub-adult females, and only one of two males captured was in reproductive condition (scrotal testes). The grassland/thicket habitat at MuniPomadze was the most diverse, probably because the thicket “islands” provided shelter from potential predators, which were themselves scarce because of the openness of the habitat. The Keta Ramsar site was characterised by low abundance and diversity, attributable to human settlement and economic activity. A taxonomic report on the captured small mammal species is provided.",

In recent decades, the distribution of P. subflavus has expanded westward across the Great Plains, and little information exists on its natural history in this region. In east central Nebraska, we monitored the use of a mine by eastern pipistrelles for >1 year. A few males occupied the roost in summer, but during the period of hibernation (late September–early May), the mine was used by at least 30 individuals composed of both sexes. Most individuals first entered the mine during late September through mid-October and exited by mid-May, with numbers of individuals fluctuating throughout winter. In winter, most individuals roosted along outer passageways of the mine, but in other seasons individuals were scattered throughout the mine. Females had significantly greater body masses than males upon entering the mine in autumn and before exiting the mine in spring. Both sexes had significantly heavier body masses in autumn than in spring. Overall, 55% of individuals marked in spring returned in autumn. Males had a higher return rate (69%) than females (46%) over a single summer. Many aspects of the natural history of P. subflavus in Nebraska are similar to those reported from eastern but not from southern parts of its distribution.",

In New Mexico, few individuals have been reported in recent years, and multiple individuals are known from 9 of 12 capture sites. This study reports on additional captures of E. maculatum from Mt. Taylor (Cibola County) for 2 consecutive summers and includes evidence of a reproducing population in the area. On 30 June/1 July 2006, I captured 4 individuals of E. maculatum, including a lactating female, and on 5 June 2007, I captured a nonreproductive female. The flight of this species was directional and deliberate; I captured 5 of 6 spotted bats that came low over the earthen pond. This study demonstrates how human-made sources of water in an arid region provide opportunities for many species of bats to drink.",

            "abstractNote": "With the loss and modification of natural roosting habitat afforded by caves, abandoned mines have assumed increased importance as alternative roosting sites for Townsend’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii). However, increased human safety concerns have led to accelerated abandoned mine closure programs. To protect roosting sites in mines with significant bat activity, bat-compatible gates are installed that allow continued access to mine workings. Aside from ensuring public safety, these gates provide protection from disturbance to roosting bats. We evaluated the effects of gating on bat flight behavior at maternity colonies in 2 previously gated (control) and 2 ungated (treatment) mines that were gated during this study. We used an infrared video camera to record bat flight behavior at the entrances to each of the 4 study mines for 2 consecutive mornings and a single night each month during the warm season. Entrance (03:00–06:00) and emergence (21:00–24:00) surveys comprised 3 consecutive hours. Overall circling activity increased more than 6-fold at openings of treatment mines following gating (P < 0.001). Crowding during emergence was significantly higher (P = 0.023) in newly gated mines than in previously gated mines. Gates affect subadults during the initial-volancy periods, as detected through collisions with the gates. Increased activity of bats and collisions with the gate, which result in bats falling to the ground at mine openings, may amplify vulnerability to predators and increase energetic demands.",

Determining population characteristic baselines for big brown bat and Arizona myotis is paramount in detecting population declines before they reach critical levels. We targeted 2 bat species strongly associated with ponderosa pine forests in northern Arizona. Big brown bats and Arizona myotis readily utilize human-made structures and have a cosmopolitan distribution across the ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) ecosystem of northern Arizona (Adams 2003). Between 2005 and 2012 we installed artificial bat roosts at Camp Navajo near Flagstaff, Arizona. We captured bats at these roosting structures and marked them using modified bird bands. We established baseline population characteristics on Camp Navajo by utilizing a 7-year mark-and-recapture data set. We also provide a measure of population status that may be compared across temporal scales within the study area. In essence, this study provides the basis for an early warning system for WNS in Arizona.",

Our purpose was to describe and model maternity roost use by fringed myotis in Colorado. We compared differences between roosts occupied by maternal fringed myotis and randomly selected potential roosting locations that were not known to be occupied by this species during the maternity period. We evaluated the strength of evidence for competing hypotheses on 2 scales: one that included landscape variables and a second that included roost-site variables. We used logistic regression, Akaike’s information criterion, and multimodel inference to investigate maternity roost use by fringed myotis. The model explaining the most variability in our landscape data included grade and aspect, and the model explaining the most variability in our roost-site data was estimated volume of the roost. Understanding maternity roost use by fringed myotis can guide conservation and management decisions related to roost protection in the Rocky Mountain West. When feasible, we believe that developing knowledge about maternity roost use, as well as autumn and winter roost use, will help improve management decision making related to forest bats of conservation concern in western North America.",

Only limited published anecdotal observations exist for roost sites used by this species. Western red bats were split taxonomically from the eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) in 1988, but summaries of roosting behaviors for western red bats still appear to stem from former associations with the commonly studied eastern red bat. Our study represents the first comprehensive research on the roosting ecology of western red bats. We radio-tracked 14 adult bats to 19 different day roosts along the Mimbres River of southwestern New Mexico. While we documented that western red bats had an affinity for densely foliated trees (79%), we did not detect any selection for tree species or size. At our study site, western red bats roosted in cottonwoods (47%, Populus spp.), velvet ash (21%, Fraxinus velutina), box elder (16%, Acer negundo), and red mulberry (16%, Morus rubra). We also described clustering behavior, where groups of 2–3 adults roosted in direct contact with one another. Although the species was deemed to roost solitarily, the frequency of clustering behavior in our study suggests otherwise. If bats were observed in clusters, they typically exhibited greater roosting fidelity than solitary individuals. Because arid riparian corridors in the southwestern United States generally are considered threatened systems, protection and preservation of mechanisms that create and maintain the diversity of these riparian corridors is necessary for the survival of this uncommon and poorly understood species.",

            "abstractNote": "Glen Canyon National Recreation Area covers large and geographically unique regions of southern Utah and northern Arizona. However, multiple surveys of bats from 1952 to 2017 have not been published. Prior to 2015, most bat surveys in the recreation area were conducted using mist nets only and did not include acoustic monitoring. In this paper we compile records of bats found in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area from 1952 to 2017, including records from our recent surveys using both mist nets and acoustic sampling. During our recent surveys, 2 new species were captured (Nyctinomops macrotis and Lasionycteris noctivagans), and 2 other new species were documented using acoustic detection (Myotis evotis and Eumops perotis), bringing the total documented bat species in Glen Canyon National Recreation Area to 17 species. This paper sheds light on the diverse bat assemblage of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area that will serve as a baseline for future research and conservation efforts.",

Upon examination, we determined that one phallus was functional, as evidenced by production of urine, while the secondary phallus appeared to be overgrown with skin. A review of the medical literature relevant to diphallia suggests that this is a case of pseudodiphallia with a bifid shaft. We hypothesize that this morphological deformity likely has a low impact on the survival of this individual but may act as a physical barrier to copulation. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of diphallia in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "The northern long-eared myotis (Myotis septentrionalis), a federally threatened species, occurs in extreme northern, eastern, and southern Nebraska. These regions vary in climate due to geographic location, topography, and elevation. During a 1-week period in early July 2015, we surveyed bats across the state and observed striking variation in the reproductive status for M. septentrionalis. We examined whether or not growing degree days, an abiotic climatic factor used mainly for agricultural practices, was associated with this reproductive variation in a mammalian species. In early July, we captured only pregnant females in the Pine Ridge region of northwestern Nebraska, the region with the lowest number of growing degree days. In contrast, we captured both lactating females and flying young along the Republican River in south-central Nebraska near the border with Kansas, an area with a high, but intermediate number of growing degree days. Along the Missouri River, in extreme east-central Nebraska, along the border with Iowa, we documented lactating females with no evidence of volant young. This locality had the highest number of growing degree days. Phenotypic plasticity in timing of births for M. septentrionalis appears to be, in part, related to climatic differences across Nebraska, a relationship commonly observed for plants and invertebrates. Our study demonstrates that reproductive phenology can vary significantly across the distribution of a species and needs to be considered when making management decisions for imperiled species. Delayed reproduction in cooler regions of the species’ range presents risks to reproductive female M. septentrionalis and their nonvolant offspring, even with current protective measures. In areas with short growing seasons, restrictions on the timing of tree-cutting should be expanded beyond 31 July in more northerly parts of the species’ distribution, so as not to hinder reproductive success during the time when juvenile bats are unable to fly.",

Limited data are available about bat roosts in riparian habitats in the southwestern United States. We examined day roosts of 3 sympatric Myotis species, the southwestern myotis (Myotis auriculus), Arizona myotis (Myotis occultus), and Yuma myotis (Myotis yumanensis), along the Mimbres River in southwestern New Mexico. We tracked 3 M. auriculus, 3 M. occultus, and 1 M. yumanensis to 16 Fremont’s cottonwoods (Populus fremontii), 2 velvet ash (Fraxinus velutina), and 1 Arizona walnut ( Juglans major) within the floodplain. Roost trees generally had a greater diameter and greater likelihood of exhibiting fire damage than nearby trees. Moreover, several roosts were in tree species not previously known to be used by these bat species, and bats did not roost in human-made structures in this arid riparian corridor.",

            "abstractNote": "The northern long-eared myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) is a forest-obligate, tree-roosting bat of the United States and Canada. Most prior studies on roost characteristics were conducted in contiguous forested habitats of eastern North America, where roosting opportunities are potentially numerous. At the western end of its distribution in the Great Plains, M. septentrionalis inhabits narrow, forested riparian waterways. Because these ribbons of forest differ from habitats farther east, roost selection by M. septentrionalis at the western edge of its distribution might differ and affect management practices in the region. Moreover, M. septentrionalis is imperiled by a deadly fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative agent of white-nose syndrome. Additionally, declining species tend to persist along the periphery of distributional ranges. In northwestern Nebraska, the Pine Ridge region is a landscape characterized by pine-dominated rocky escarpments and represents the westernmost distribution of M. septentrionalis in the state. In this study, we identified roosts for 21 M. septentrionalis, mainly lactating females, during the summers of 2015 and 2016. Bats were located roosting in live trees, snags, and fallen logs, as well as in a wooden fence post. Roost trees varied greatly in height (5.0–27.2 m) and diameter (18.1–114.3 cm), but all roost structures possessed cracks, holes, exfoliating bark, or a combination of these small retreats. Despite their prevalence in the study region, ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) surrounding small watercourses were not typically used as roosts, with M. septentrionalis regularly roosting in deciduous trees along watercourses. Individuals switched roosts frequently, but subsequent roosts were typically in close proximity to one another. The high proportion of live trees used was a major difference in roost characteristics compared to other studies farther east, where roosts primarily occur in snags. Scattered deciduous trees in narrow riparian corridors were best described as open-canopy woodlands, which differs from use of closed-canopy forests in eastern parts of the species’ distribution. Our data on roost characteristics in an open woodland habitat for this species, which is a previously undescribed habitat type for M. septentrionalis, will assist in regional management for this federally threatened bat, as some aspects of roost selection appear to be site-specific across its distribution.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are difficult to study due to their nocturnal, cryptic, and highly vagile nature. Ongoing advances in acoustic recording hardware and call classification software have made species detection and activity monitoring more feasible. Our objectives were to determine the effort necessary to monitor bat assemblages using an occupancy framework and acoustic data and to provide guidelines for researchers interested in developing similar monitoring programs. We collected data at 2 study areas in South Texas from June through September in 2015, 2016, and 2017. We used Pettersson D500X Mk II real-time full-spectrum detectors and classified sound files using SonoBat bat call analysis software. We attempted to collect data during 2 visits to individual sites, with up to 5 consecutive nights per visit each year. We estimated occupancy rates for each species in each study area using occupancy models in Program MARK and included terms to define trends in detection probability through the season. Over the 3 years of our study, we sampled 106 sites with 803 sampling nights and classified a total of 2880 sound files to 7 species. Data sets for 6 of the species supported models indicating that detection probability varied throughout our sampling period. Our results generally indicate that sample sizes between 10 and 20 sites would be required to detect declines in occupancy of 50% over 25 years using 10 nights per site with a starting occupancy rate of 0.70. Detecting declines of 30% in 10 years may require >75 sampling sites. Finally, our analysis shows that recognizing seasonal variation in detection probability, and then timing surveys accordingly, can greatly reduce sample size requirements.",

            "abstractNote": "Woodland seasonal pools in the northern Great Lakes region, limited in this study to northern Wisconsin and Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, are potentially important sites for bat feeding and drinking. In order to determine the influence of pool size, hydroperiod, and structural complexity on relative bat activity, I surveyed pools (17 in 2004, eight in 2005 and 2006) at approximately two-week intervals throughout the summer, documenting bat species use with mist nets and AnaBat II echolocation recording systems. In 189 mist net-nights over three summers, I captured 114 individuals and identified 21,591 AnaBat call sequences. Little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) dominated the captures (75.4%) and AnaBat call sequences (83.3%). Northern myotis (M. septentrionalis) were less common (19.3% of captures, 6.4% of identified call sequences) but ubiquitous across pools. Four additional species (Lasiurus borealis, L. cinereus, Eptesicus fuscus, and Lasionycteris noctivagans) were more commonly documented at larger pools. Across all years, relative bat activity (as estimated by call sequences per night) was significantly influenced by pool size (more activity at small and large pools than medium pools) and covaried with the proportion of water remaining in the pool. My study emphasizes the utility of pools of all sizes to bats, as larger-bodied bats preferentially use larger pools, while smaller-bodied Myotis spp. are capable of foraging at pools of all sizes. Relative activity of all species was secondarily driven by pool hydroperiod, as the number of bat call sequences per night decreased as the amount of open water declined.",

            "abstractNote": "In order to monitor bat population trends, an annual census is performed of all known underground hibernacula in Europe. During these censuses, bats are sometimes found to show signs of arousal, presumably from non-tactile stimuli caused by the observer, e.g. air currents, sound, light or an increase in temperature. We assume that heat and/or light from a torch can play a role in awaking hibernating bats. Observers use diﬀerent light sources, which produce diﬀerent amounts of heat. We experimentally tested the heat produced by three commonly used torches: two incandescent torches (krypton and halogen) and one LED torch. We performed the experiment on 28 January 2007 in an old brick kiln in Windesheim (Overijssel Province, the Netherlands), which is used by hibernating bats. The results show that temperatures in a crevice signiﬁcantly increased when using the ’hot’ incandescent torch types. The eﬀect of these torches on both air and surface temperature was signiﬁcant after both 10 and 30 seconds. Under the assumption that an increase of the ambient temperature by 58C or more can cause a bat to arouse from torpor, we conclude that using ’hot’ torches such as incandescent (halogen) lights poses a risk to the animals under study. To minimise heat disturbance from light sources, we recommend LED torches as the best available alternative.",

            "abstractNote": "Suppression of wildfires and variation in climatic patterns during the last century have caused increases in tree density and understory debris throughout forests of western North America. These structural changes enabled wildfires to ascend into forest canopies, causing high-intensity, stand-replacing fires that affect wildlife differently than low-intensity understory fires. Bats are common inhabitants of western forests. They forage on forest-dwelling insects, and some species roost in trees. Herein, I report on the relative abundance and species richness of bats immediately after a wildfire in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest of southwestern New Mexico. Of 7 netting sites throughout the state with similar paired netting efforts from late May to early July 2006, the greatest decrease (54%) in overall captures of bats occurred at the single site that experienced a canopy, stand-replacing wildfire around most of the site. Most other netting sites with paired sampling yielded increases in bat captures, whereas a few sites had minimal decreases during a summer with little precipitation. At the site affected by a wildfire, captures of Arizona myotis (Myotis occultus) decreased the most, with a 94% decline in females. However, captures of male M. occultus were similar prefire and postfire. Silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) also declined in number, with a 59% reduction in captures. For all species combined, captures of females declined 84%, whereas captures of males declined 35%. The number of species detected during both sampling sessions were relatively similar, with only a few more species detected at the site prior to the fire. Species that commonly roost in ponderosa pines, especially those that form maternity colonies, appeared most affected by this intense fire. These opportunistically collected data help us to understand the possible immediate effects of stand-replacing fires on bats in ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern United States for which little information previously was known.",

The objectives of this review are to describe these risk factors, to alert clinicians to the different presenting manifestations of histoplasmosis, and to recommend effective management and prevention strategies.\nMethods—Internet search engines were queried with keywords to select articles for review over the study period, 1950 to 2018. Articles selected for review included case series, epidemiologic analyses of surveillance data, clinical and laboratory updates, immunologic investigations, and observational and longitudinal studies. Articles excluded from review included systemic mycosis reviews and clinicopathologic conference reports.\nResults—The principal transmission mechanism of histoplasmosis is by inhalation of spores aerosolized by soil disruption, resulting in pneumonic infections ranging from asymptomatic to disseminated. Although histoplasmosis is more common in endemic regions, nonendemic regions have reported increasing autochthonous and imported cases. Immunocompromised persons are at signiﬁcantly increased risks of contracting histoplasmosis. Environmental and wilderness-related risk factors for histoplasmosis include bird and bat watching, cave and cave entrance exploration, and bamboo removal and burning. Occupational risk factors for histoplasmosis include road construction, rooﬁng, bridge and water tower work, demolition, and masonry.\nConclusions—Histoplasmosis can result in considerable morbidity. Increased awareness of disease risk factors among the public and the international healthcare community will improve the timely diagnosis and treatment of histoplasmosis and prevent disease progression and dissemination.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat activity surveys (walked surveys combining transect and point counts) are extremely important for collecting data throughout Europe in conservation and planning contexts. To ensure optimal data, it is vital to ensure synchronicity between survey time and peak bat activity. However, although protocols for two‐hour dusk activity surveys are well accepted, recommended start time in relation to sunset is a ‘best guess’ rather than based on empirical evidence. Accepted practice differs widely with recommended start times varying from 30 min pre‐sunset (finishing 90 min post‐sunset) to 30 min post‐sunset (finishing 2.5 h after sunset). We provide the first empirical test of optimal start times for dusk activity surveys by comparing bat activity at the same sites on the same nights. Four sites were surveyed, viz. two high‐quality woodland sites and two low‐quality agricultural sites. At each site, surveyors walked the same route and stopped at the same pre‐defined listening points for three repeat surveys per night: 1) starting 30 min pre‐sunset; 2) starting at sunset; and 3) starting 30 min post‐sunset. In total, 240 hours' of data were collected. Four species, all widespread and common throughout Europe, were recorded: common pipistrelle\n              Pipistrellus pipistrellus,\n              soprano pipistrelle\n              P. pygmaeus\n              , Natterer's\n              Myotis natterai\n              and noctule\n              Nyctalus noctule.\n              Recorded bat activity was highest on sunset and post‐sunset surveys both generally (overall bat activity) and for all specific species encountered. Findings were generally consistent for both low‐ and high‐quality habitats. The same species were generally represented in both point and transect data but point data yielded higher estimates of overall activity in low‐quality habitat and higher bat species richness in both high‐ and low‐quality habitat relative to transect data. We recommend that: 1) two‐hour dusk bat activity surveys start at/after sunset not before sunset and 2) both transect and point data are collected and analysed.",

            "abstractNote": "The endemic orange leaf-nosed bat, Rhinonicteris aurantius, is a relict both in a phylogenetic and a geographic sense. Prior to this study, two colonies in disused mines and seven other records of single animals were known from the disjunct Pilbara population of Western Australia. Cave roosts were located in the region for the first time, five new roosts were found in disused mines and the species was recorded in five new localities. Cave roosts were discovered in sandstone bedding. Free-flying R. aurantius were located in a diverse range of landscapes composed of banded iron formation, Cleaverville Formation geology and granite. Mines utilised as roosts were structurally complex and in some cases breached the watertable. This study revealed that while the species is widespread throughout the region, it is restricted to certain landform units, the number of suitable roosts within landform units is limited and the population appears to be subdivided within the region. Dispersal and connectivity within the population may be dependent on the availability of roosts in intervening areas, which may be a function of the availability of groundwater to subterranean formations for the control of roost microclimate. Currently, the known breeding range is one gorge at Barlee Range Nature Reserve and one mine at Bamboo Creek.",

The analysis of population dynamics using life-history traits and life tables is widely used in planning for the conservation and management of wildlife. In the present study, the first life table for any species of bat is provided and age estimates derived from counts of annual increments in tooth cementum rings are used to assess population trends and life-history traits in the spectacled flying fox on the Atherton Tablelands in north Queensland. As a result of high mortality, longevity was much shorter than expected from a theoretical basis. Life-table analyses suggest that the population experienced a 16% decrease during the 2 years of study. Absence of extended longevity to compensate for low reproductive output and delayed sexual maturity in ‘slow end’ mammal species such as P. conspicillatus reduces the window of opportunity for females to reproduce and adapt to changes in mortality rates. This study suggests that spectacled flying fox populations are sensitive to increased mortality and that reducing mortality rates should be the primary goal in conservation planning for P. conspicillatus.",

            "abstractNote": "Many hundreds of species of wildlife worldwide are dependent on tree hollows (cavities) for their survival. I reviewed the published literature for hollow-using Australian birds and microbats to document their tree-hollow requirements and to guide future research and management. Such information is vital to the conservation of these species. The hollow requirements of only 35 of 114 hollow-using bird species and 15 of 42 hollow-using microbat species were documented in some detail. This overall paucity of information limits the ability to manage for the future requirements of species. However, some generalisations can guide management until further studies are conducted. Most species used a variety of available tree species, and the extensive use of dead trees probably reﬂects the high likelihood of these trees containing hollows. Birds (other than large parrots) and bats chose hollow entrances of a size close to body width. Large parrots require large hollows, with a preference for large vertical spouts and trunk hollows. Few birds or bats demonstrated an absolute requirement for high (>10 m) tree hollows, with most (70%) using some hollows with entrances 5 m above ground. Temperature has been postulated to inﬂuence roost selection among microbats because it enables passive rewarming from torpor and there is some evidence from Australian bats to support this. Many studies suggest a future shortage of hollow-bearing trees. Currently, artiﬁcial hollows appear to be the most likely interim solution to address this. Knowledge of the natural hollow requirements of species can be used to reﬁne artiﬁcial-hollow designs. An increase in research effort is needed to address the many gaps in knowledge that currently exist. Priorities for research include (1) many additional studies to document the characteristics of the hollow-bearing trees used by species of microbat, (2) the need to conduct long-term bioregional studies of hollow-bearing tree attrition to help identify where management responses are most needed and (3) investigating whether ﬁre plays a signiﬁcant role in the creation of tree hollows of a range of size classes and therefore may have a management use. Such information has broad relevance because it will provide ecological insight that can be applied to the management of hollow-using birds and bats elsewhere in the world.",

            "abstractNote": "Artiﬁcial tree hollows (nest or roost boxes) may be of considerable importance to the conservation and management of Australian hollow-using birds and microbats. This is suggested by recognition that the rate of collapse of hollow-bearing trees may exceed replacement in some landscapes. We review the published literature to synthesise current information on the use of artiﬁcial hollows by Australian birds and bats, and to provide guidance to future research and management. The use of artiﬁcial hollows has been documented in some detail for 15 native bird and eight microbat species. A range of hollow designs has been employed but there is a limited understanding of favoured designs. General designs (e.g. front-entry plywood boxes) have been used extensively by some species and should continue to be used until more effective designs are identiﬁed. Species tend to use artiﬁcial hollows that have entrance sizes just sufﬁcient for their body size, and this should guide hollow design. Competitive interactions with a range of non-target species (native and non-native) may have a pronounced inﬂuence on artiﬁcial hollow use and must be considered in any management program involving artiﬁcial hollows. We highlight some design elements that may reduce interference by non-target species. Temperature inside artiﬁcial hollows may have a particular inﬂuence on their use by bats due to the role of microclimate in bat thermoregulation. Trials are needed to investigate this factor and to inform general approaches to positioning of artiﬁcial hollows. Several distinct management uses exist for artiﬁcial hollows, including assisting threatened species recovery, e.g. Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus) and orange-bellied parrot (Neophema chrysogaster). Artiﬁcial hollows offer an interim solution to hollow shortage but their full potential will only be realised when preferences for different designs are better understood. This will require a commitment to monitoring and should be conducted in an adaptive management context. Increased knowledge of the use of artiﬁcial hollows by Australian birds and bats should be of global relevance to the management of hollow-using species because it provides an independent test of ideas and strengthens any generalisations.",

            "abstractNote": "Context. Urbanisation poses new challenges for wildlife worldwide, and recent research suggests that urban parks, although highly modiﬁed, may act as important refuges. Insectivorous bats can persist in urban landscapes and play an important role in keeping insect populations in balance. Previous research on use of urban landscapes by these bats has often focused on patches of remnant bushland within cities, but their use of highly modiﬁed open spaces is not well understood. Aims. We aimed to determine the use of open green spaces (e.g. open parks, sports ovals) by insectivorous bats in Melbourne, Australia and to identify landscape factors that inﬂuence their presence and activity level. Methods. We conducted passive acoustic surveys at 35 sites across greater Melbourne. Once species were identiﬁed from the echolocation call data, we modelled species richness, total activity and activity of individual species against landscape and weather variables, using Generalised Linear Mixed Models and Generalised Additive Mixed Models. Key results. Across 557 detector nights, we identiﬁed at least 11 of the 17 species recorded to occur in Melbourne. Both species richness and activity were greater in areas with more nearby trees and lesser in areas with more roads. There were weaker species-speciﬁc relationships between bat activity and both distance to the nearest water source and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index. Species richness and activity levels were lower on nights with a lower temperature at dusk, higher rainfall and stronger wind. Conclusions. Our results show that multiple bat species consistently use Melbourne’s open green spaces, highlighting the potential habitat value of these areas, especially those surrounded by high tree densities and fewer roads. Implications. Insectivorous bats play important roles within ecosystems and bring beneﬁts to human society. To encourage the diversity and activity of insectivorous bats in urban landscapes, we recommend retaining and increasing indigenous vegetation surrounding open areas in urban parks, as well as more strategic planning of new urban parks that further increases tree density in cities.",

Recent concern about the importanceof bridges for bats precipitated studies to address their use of bridges as day and night roosts. We conducted a study to determine whether boxes installed beneath flat-bottom bridges would provide opportunities for day and night roosting by bats. We evaluated roosting by bats within boxes installed under 15 flat-bottom bridges spanning streams in the western Oregon Cascades. We monitored use of boxes by roosting bats during 15 weekly surveys conducted each year between 1 June and 19 September 1997 and 1998. We used guano collected from traps located under roost boxes to indicate day and night roost use by bats. Observations of bats during surveys confirmed that boxes were used as day roosts. We documented use by bats in 13 of 15 (87%) boxes during the study; 10 boxes were used within a year after installment. The number of times guano was collected from traps under boxes used by bats ranged from one to 16 (3 to 53% of 30 surveys). We observed one to 8 bats dayroosting in boxes on 14 separate occasions at 5 boxes. These data confirm that boxes installed under flat-bottom bridges provide roosting opportunities for some species of bats. We contend that designs for flat-bottom bridges could incorporate opportunities for roosting by bats without the aid of supplemental structures.",

We surveyed bridges for day-roosting bats in the Kisatchie National Forest of Louisiana to assess how temporal patterns of bridge use and disturbance from surveyors might affect survey results. We found no support for the hypothesis that surveys of day-roosts affected bat use of bridges. The 3 most common species roosting under bridges, Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii), eastern pipistrelles (Pipistrellus subflavus), and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus),exhibited strikingly different patterns of seasonal use. Because of seasonal variation in bridge use, a monitoring program would need to involve a minimum of a summer and a winter survey to document all common species that use bridges. Surveys during the day detected many more bats than surveys conducted at night. Although individuals tended to return to the same roosts over long periods of time, tagged bats often were absent during intervening surveys. Because individuals used multiple roosts, at least 3 surveys within a season will be necessary if an objective is to determine which specific bridges are used as roosts by locally abundant species.",
