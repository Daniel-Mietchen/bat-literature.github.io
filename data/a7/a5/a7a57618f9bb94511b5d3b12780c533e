In a previous study, we found that subjecting individuals of Carollia perspicillata to a chronic immobilization stress paradigm resulted in a signiﬁcant increase of fecal cortisol concentrations. In the present study, we investigated the inﬂuence of stress on the behavior of C. perspicillata, by adapting a commonly used behavioral paradigm for characterizing coping styles of animals (i.e., the elevated-plus maze) to bats. Adult bats were subjected 1 h/day to immobilization over a period of 10 days. On the subsequent day, the behavior of each animal was analyzed in a custom-made plus maze, consisting of four arms (two open and two enclosed ones) and designed 3D because of the bats’ ability to ﬂy. In this newly invented design, we compared the behaviors of stressed animals and controls. Changes in locomotor and exploratory behavior suggest two divergent adaptive behaviors in C. perspicillata following the chronic stress paradigm, possibly indicating different stress coping styles.",

To assess if functional requirements such as detection of small insects versus larger stationary surfaces of plants are reXected in cortical properties, we compare delay-tuned neurons in a frugivorous (C. perspicillata, CP) and an insectivorous (P. parnellii, PP) bat species that belong to related families within the superfamily of Noctilionoidea. The bandwidth and shape of delay-tuning curves and the range of characteristic delays are similar in both species and hence are not related to diVerent echolocation strategies. Most units respond at 2–6 ms echo delay with most sensitive thresholds of 20–30 dB SPL. In CP, units tuned to delays >12 ms are slightly more abundant and are more sensitive than in PP. All delay-tuned neurons in CP reliably respond to single pure-tone stimuli, whereas such responses are only observed in 49% of delay-tuned units in PP. The cortical representation of echo delay (chronotopy) covers a larger area in CP but is less precise than described in PP. Since chronotopy is absent in certain other insectivorous bat species, it is open if these diVerences in topography are related to echolocation behaviour.",

(1) The CF2 frequency of pulses emitted by individual bats at rest (Frest) showed a long-term gradual decline by 0.22 kHz on average over a period of 3 months. The mean neighboring Frest (interindividual differences in Frest between neighboring bats when the bats were arranged in ascending order according to Frest) ranged from 0.08 to 0.11 kHz among 18 bats in a laboratory colony. (2) The standard deviation of observed echo CF2 (reference frequency) for bats during paired ﬂights ranged from 50 to 90 Hz, which was not signiﬁcantly different from that during single ﬂights. This ﬁnding suggests that during paired ﬂights, bats exhibit Doppler-shift compensation with the same accuracy as when they ﬂy alone. (3) In 60 % (n = 29) of the cases, the difference in the reference frequency between two bats during paired ﬂights signiﬁcantly decreased compared to when the bats ﬂew alone. However, only 15 % of the cases (n = 7) showed a signiﬁcant increase during paired ﬂights. The difference in frequency between two bats did not increase even when the reference frequencies of the individuals were not statistically different during single ﬂights.",

            "abstractNote": "Singing plays an important role in the social lives of several disparate bat species, but just how significant the behavior may be among bats generally is unknown. Recent discoveries suggest singing by bats might be surprisingly more diverse and widespread than anticipated, but if true then two questions must be addressed: firstly why has singing been so rarely documented among bats, and secondly do bats sing for the same reasons as songbirds? We address the first question by reviewing how sampling bias and technical constraints may have produced a myopic view of bat social communication. To address the second question, we review evidence from 50 years of batsong literature supporting the supposition that bat singing is linked to the same constellation of ecological variables that favored birdsong, including territoriality, polygyny, metabolic constraints, migratory behaviors and especially powered flight. We propose that bats sing like birds because they fly like birds; flight is energetically expensive and singing reduces time spent flying. Factoring in the singular importance of acoustic communication for echolocating bats, it seems likely that singing may prove to be relatively common among certain groups of bats once it becomes clear when and where to look for it.",

In a large room, actual pairs of bats exhibited greater disparity in peak frequency (PF), minimum frequency (FMIN) and call period compared to virtual pairs of bats, each flying alone. Greater inter-individual disparity in PF and FMIN may reduce acoustic interference and/ or increase signal self-recognition in the presence of conspecifics. Bats flying alone in a smaller flight room, to simulate a more cluttered habitat as compared to the large flight room, produced calls of shorter duration and call period, lower intensity, and flew at lower speeds. In cluttered space, shorter call duration should reduce masking, while shorter call period equals more updates to the bat’s auditory scene. Lower intensity likely reflects reduced range detection requirements, reduced speed the demands of flying in clutter. Our results show that some changes (e.g. PF separation) are associated with conspecifics, others with closed habitat (e.g. reduced call intensity). However, we demonstrate that call duration, period, and flight speed appear similarly influenced by conspecifics and clutter. We suggest that some changes reduce conspecific interference and/or improve self-recognition, while others demonstrate that bats experience each other like clutter.",

            "abstractNote": "Echolocating bats measure target distance by the time delay between call and echo. Target movement such as the flutter of insect wings induces delay modulations. Perception of delay modulations has been studied extensively in bats, but only concerning how well bats discriminate flutter frequencies, never with regard to flutter magnitude. We used an auditory virtual reality approach to generate changes in echo delay that were independent of call repetition rate, mimicking fluttering insect wings. We show that in the frequency-modulating (FM) bat Phyllostomus discolor, the sensitivity for modulations in echo delay depends on the rate of the modulation, with bats being most sensitive at modulation rates below 20 Hz and above 50 Hz. The very short duration of their calls compels FM bats to evaluate slow modulations (< about 100 Hz) across entire echo sequences. This makes them susceptible to interference between their own call repetition rate and the modulation rate. We propose that this phenomenon constitutes an echo-acoustic wagon-wheel effect. We further demonstrate how at high modulation rates, flutter sensitivity could be rescued by using spectral and temporal cues introduced by Doppler distortions. Thus, Doppler distortions may play a crucial role in flutter sensitivity in the hundreds of FM species worldwide.",

Bats were exposed to distress calls/playbacks (PBs) of distress calls/modified calls and were then trained to novel odors. Bats exposed to distress calls/PBs made significantly fewer feeding attempts and bouts of PBs exposed to modified calls, which significantly induced the expression of c-Fos in the caudomedial neostriatum (NCM) and the amygdala compared to bats exposed to modified calls and trained controls. However, the expression of c-Fos in the hippocampus was not significantly different between the experimental groups. Further, protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) expression was significantly lower, and the expression levels of E1A homologue of CREB-binding protein (CBP) (P300), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its tyrosine kinase B1 (TrkB1) receptor were significantly higher in the hippocampus of control/bats exposed to modified calls compared to distress calls/PBs of distress call-exposed bats. Exposure to the call possibly alters the reciprocal interaction between the amygdala and the hippocampus, accordingly regulating the expression levels of PP1, P300 and BDNF and its receptor TrkB1 following training to the novel odor. Thus, the learning and memory consolidation processes were disrupted and showed fewer feeding attempts and bouts. This model may be helpful for understanding the contributions of stressful social communications to human disorders.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats use echolocation to detect targets such as insect prey. The echolocation call of frequency-modulating bats (FM bats) typically sweeps through a broad range of frequencies within a few milliseconds. The large bandwidth grants the bat high spatial acuity in depicting the target. However, the extremely short call duration and the overall low duty cycle of call emission impair the bat’s capability to detect e.g. target movement. Nonetheless, FM bats constitute more than 80% of all echolocating species and are able to navigate and forage in an environment full of moving targets. We used an auditory virtual reality approach to generate changes in echo amplitude reflective of fluttering insect wings independently from other confounding parameters. We show that the FM bat Phyllostomus discolor successfully detected these modulations in echo amplitude and that their performance increased with the rate of the modulation, mimicking faster insect wing-beats. The ability of FM bats to detect amplitude modulations of echoes suggests a release from the trade-off between spatial and temporal acuity and highlights the diversity of selective pressures working on the echolocation system of bats.",

Embedded in the dorsal and ventral membranes of bat wings are microscopic hairs. Past research findings implicate dorsal wing hairs in airflow sensing for flight control, but the function of ventral wing hairs has not been previously investigated. Here, we test the hypothesis that ventral wing hairs carry mechanosensory signals for flight control, prey capture, and handling. To test this hypothesis, we used synchronized high-speed stereo video and audio recordings to quantify flight and echolocation behaviors of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) engaged in an aerial insect capture task. We analyzed prey-capture strategy and performance, along with flight kinematics, before and after depilation of microscopic hairs from the bat’s ventral wing and tail membranes. We found that ventral wing hair depilation significantly impaired the bat’s prey-capture performance. Interestingly, ventral wing hair depilation also produced increases in the bat’s flight speed, an effect previously attributed exclusively to airflow sensing along the dorsal wing surface. These findings demonstrate that microscopic hairs embedded in the ventral wing and tail membranes of insectivorous bats provide mechanosensory feedback for prey handling and flight control.",

Type-2 signals had durations around 6 ms and were composed of an initial shallowly downward frequency modulated component, starting at about 45 kHz and followed by a shorter more steeply modulated component that ended at about 32 kHz. Type-1 signals were rather stereotyped with durations around 2.5 ms and a very short rise time. They covered an approximately 8 kHz-wide frequency band positioned just below the 12±15 kHz-wide frequency band of type-2 signals, with no or small frequency overlap. In the recordings, type-1 signals almost had always a higher amplitude than type2 signals, at least partly caused by head movements. Assuming that signal structure re¯ects function, we hypothesize that type-2 signals have the same adaptive value as the signals with a broadband and narrowband component of other vespertilionids, but with a reverse arrangement of the signal elements. Like the broadband component of the type-2 signals, type-1 signals are well suited to localize background targets. Thus, the localization component may be distributed among two signals separated in time, which has the advantage that both signals can be varied independently in the direction of emission and in amplitude.",

            "abstractNote": "Pregnancy and lactation are energetically demanding periods for female mammals. Unique amongst mammals, bats have to allocate considerable amounts of energy into their oﬀspring because juveniles cannot be weaned until they are capable of ﬂying at almost adult size. Similar to other bat species, female nectar-feeding bats should increase their energy intake after parturition to meet the energy demands of oﬀspring growth. However, previous studies have shown that nectar-feeding bats diﬀer from other similar-sized bats in having a much higher metabolic rate. Therefore, I examined how nectarivorous bats respond to the energetic challenge of reproduction. In this study, the daily energy intake of pregnant and lactating Glossophaga soricina was measured during a 6-week period prior to and a 10-week period after parturition. Body mass of G. soricina increased linearly until parturition. Within the same time period, daily ﬂight time decreased and daily energy intake remained constant. Probably, the reduced ﬂight activity of pregnant bats compensated for the increased power requirements of ﬂight, thus resulting in an almost constant daily energy turnover. During 35 days after parturition, neither ﬂight time, body mass nor daily energy intake of lactating females changed signiﬁcantly. On average, the daily energy intake of pregnant, lactating or non-reproducing G. soricina was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent. Possibly, for unknown reasons, female G. soricina maintain a daily energy intake of a constant high level during and beyond reproduction.",

As hovering ﬂight is considered to be energetically costly, clinging to ﬂowers would be beneﬁcial from an energetic perspective. I examined the rate of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide release during clinging ﬂower visitation in two 10-g Glossophaga soricina (Glossophinae: Phyllostomidae) to evaluate the potential energetic beneﬁt of clinging versus hovering. In addition, I measured the duration of ﬂower visits of free-ranging glossophagine bats to Markea neurantha (Solanaceae), a bat-pollinated plant that allows both hovering and clinging ﬂower visitation. After 20 s of clinging to an artiﬁcial respiratory mask, the bats’ respiratory exchange ratio did not signiﬁcantly deviate from 1, indicating the combustion of sugar. The average oxygen uptake rate equaled 1.39 ml min)1 (±0.38 SD, STPD) and the carbon dioxide release rate equaled 1.33 ml min)1 (±0.20 SD, STPD) for feeder visits longer than 20 s (n=79). Converting the oxygen uptake rate into power input yielded 0.49 W, less than a third of the power requirements for hovering for a 10-g bat. Free-ranging 10-g glossophagine bats exploited ﬂowers of M. neurantha for, on average, 0.32 s ( ±0.14 SD, n=273) during hovering and for 0.39 s (±0.18 SD, n=152) during clinging visitations. A comparison between the power requirements of ﬂower exploitation in diﬀerently sized bats indicates that clinging would beneﬁt larger nectar-feeding bats to a greater extent than smaller species.",

These animals increase their food intake in response to a decrease in food quality, a behavior named ‘‘intake response’’. However, their capacity to achieve compensatory feeding, in which they maintain a constant ﬂux of energy, could be constrained by physiological processes. Here we evaluated how both a seasonal change in environmental conditions and physiological constraints affected the food ingestion in the bat Glossophaga soricina. We measured food intake rate during both the wet/warm and dry/cool seasons at sucrose solutions ranging from 146 to 1,022 mmol L-1. We expected that food intake and metabolic demands would be greater during the dry/cool season. Bats ingested *20% more food in the dry/cool than in the wet/warm season. Regardless of season, bats were unable to achieve a constant ﬂux of energy when facing the different sugar concentrations that we used in our experiments. This suggests that the rate of food intake is physiologically constrained in G. soricina. Using the digestive capacity of bats we modeled their food intake. The analytic model we used predicts that digestive limitations to ingest energy should have an important effect on the ecology of this species.",

            "abstractNote": "Species with broad geographic ranges may experience varied environmental conditions throughout their range leading to local adaptation. Variation among populations reflects potential adaptability or plasticity, with implications for populations impacted by disease, climate change, and other anthropogenic influences. However, behavior may counteract divergent selection among populations. We studied intraspecific variation in hibernation physiology of Myotis lucifugus (little brown myotis) and Corynorhinus townsendii (Townsend’s big-eared bat), two species of bats with large geographic ranges. We studied M. lucifugus at three hibernacula which spanned a latitudinal gradient of 1500 km, and C. townsendii from 6 hibernacula spread across 1200 km latitude and 1200 km longitude. We found no difference in torpid metabolic rate among populations of either species, nor was there a difference in the effect of ambient temperature among sites. Evaporative water loss was similar among populations of both species, with the exception of one C. townsendii pairwise site difference and one M. lucifugus site that differed from the others. We suggest the general lack of geographic variation is a consequence of behavioral microhabitat selection. As volant animals, bats can travel relatively long distances in search of preferred microclimates for hibernation. Despite dramatic macroclimate differences among populations, hibernating bats are able to find preferred microclimate conditions within their range, resulting in similar selection pressures among populations spread across wide geographic ranges.",

I tested these predictions by estimating the power input during horizontal ¯ight in three pregnant and two subadult Glossophaga soricina using a multivariate regression model. This analysis yielded power input during resting and ¯ight as well as the energetic equivalent of change in body mass. A comparison of the estimated ¯ight power for pregnant G. soricina, with published data on ¯ight power of nonpregnant adults, revealed that energy turnover in ¯ight is highest for pregnant G. soricina. Flight power of a 13-g pregnant G. soricina was even higher than that of a 16-g non-pregnant Glossophaga longirostris. A least-squares regression analysis yielded the following equations for the intraspeci®c scaling of ¯ight power with body mass: power input during horizontal ¯ight (Pf)  24099 body mass (bm; kg)2.15 (r2  0.97) for the intra-individual allometry (pregnancy) and Pf  113 bm(kg)0.95 (r2  0.99) for the inter-individual allometry (ontogeny). Both mass exponents are not signi®cantly dierent from the predicted values for the scaling relationship of ¯ight power within an individual (1.56) and within a species (1.19). This is the ®rst measurement of power input during ¯ight for subadult and pregnant bats.",

Old records are reviewed and several new records added, while four recorded species have been excluded. One species, the black rhinoceros, is reported to have become extinct; another, the klipspringer, does not now occur in the area. Evidence for its alleged former presence and extinction is assessed. Red deer, introduced to Kilimanjaro during the German colonial period, is now extinct on the mountain. Other reported extinctions and colonisations of mammal species on Kilimanjaro are discussed and 19 marginal species or taxa for which further information is needed are mentioned for completeness.",

Recently, it has been suggested that a close evolutionary relationship with humans could result in similar social skills in domesticated species. An alternative view is that the mechanism is not genetic domestication alone but instead a combination of phylogenetic and ontogenetic variables. Here we test the necessity of phylogenetic domestication by investigating the point-following behavior of a captive population of nondomesticated megachiropteran bats (Pteropus pumilus, Pteropus rodricensis, Pteropus conspicillatus, Pteropus vampyrus). Three of five subjects were highly successful in following an unfamiliar human’s point to a target location, providing the first empirical evidence of cross-species social referencing in bats. The three successful bats were all born in captivity and socialized to humans early in life, whereas unsuccessful bats were wild-born individuals. This study provides evidence that referential point following is not restricted to domesticated animals and indicates that early experience may be important. Megachiropteran bats may prove to be a useful model for studying social behaviors.",

Results for animals are summarised by Class (Amphibia, Aves, Gastropoda, Insecta, Malacostraca, Mammalia, Reptilia) and presented for plants as a whole (Classes Bryopsida, Cycadopsida, Jungermanniopsida, Liliopsida, Lycopodiopsida, Magnoliopsida, Pinopsida, Polypodiopsida). We analyse the status of previously known and newly identified sites in which globally threatened biodiversity occurs and summarise the current state of research on the globally threatened and ecologically critical biodiversity of the EACF. We then provide recommendations for future research, environmental regulations, and management regimes based upon comprehensive and reliable data to ensure the continued survival of the EACF’s biodiversity within the context of sustainable resource utilisation.",

Comparatively little is sourced from (typically uncertiﬁed) smallholders. We argue that sourcing sustainable palm oil should not be determined by commercial certiﬁcation alone and that the certiﬁcation process should be revisited. There are so-far unrecognized beneﬁts of sourcing palm oil from smallholders that should be considered if genuine biodiversity conservation is to be a foundation of ‘environmentally sustainable’ palm oil production. Despite a lack of certiﬁcation, smallholder production is often more biodiversity-friendly than certiﬁed production from large-scale plantations. Sourcing palm oil from smallholders also alleviates poverty among rural farmers, promoting better conservation outcomes. Yet, certiﬁcation schemes e the current measure of ‘sustainability’ e are ﬁnancially accessible only for large-scale plantations that operate as proﬁt-driven monocultures. Industrial palm oil is expanding rapidly in regions with weak environmental laws and enforcement. This warrants the development of an alternative certiﬁcation scheme for smallholders. Greater attention should be directed to deforestationfree palm oil production in smallholdings, where production is less likely to cause large scale biodiversity loss. These small-scale farmlands in which palm oil is mixed with other crops should be considered by retailers and consumers who are interested in promoting sustainable palm oil production. Simultaneously, plantation companies should be required to make their existing production landscapes more compatible with enhanced biodiversity conservation.",

The goal of our study was to better understand the drivers of bat activity in agricultural landscapes to inform conservation policy and make specific recommendations for habitat management. We placed sixty-four full spectrum bat detectors at random recording locations, weekly, along field boundaries in North Somerset between July and October 2020. We used an automated classifier to analyse recordings and performed error rate modelling to account for and remove the majority of error in automated classifications. We used generalised additive models to explore bat response to recording location metrics, controlling for spatialautocorrelation and temporal differences in sampling. We validated our models with k-fold cross-validation and explored the utility of our models for predicting bat activity at new sites. We found that field boundary characteristics better describe bat activity than adjacent field characteristics or measures of local landscape for the majority of species studied. Bat activity was higher along tall, wide, vegetated field boundaries containing trees; there was lower activity at arable recording locations. Still, bat activity was highly variable and predictive error was high. We found a large spatial effect driving activity patterns, meaning models are not able to predict activity beyond the extent of the study area. We recommend management strategies that give incentives to farmers for replacing fences with hedgerows, planting hedgerow trees, and maintaining tall and outgrown field boundaries.",

To assess, select and monitor these habitat trees, ecologists and practitioners often use Tree-related Microhabitats (TreMs), which are assumed to represent the abundance and diversity of environmental resources for a wide range of forest-dwelling taxa. However, the relationship between TreMs and forest organisms is not fully un­ derstood. In this context, we attempted to identify and quantify the links between TreMs and three groups of forest organisms: insects, bats, and birds. Specifically, we tested whether species abundance is influenced by TreM abundance, either as direct predictor or as mediator of environmental predictors.",

This study provides data on mammal assemblage and assessment on the added value of the ca. 2.99 km2 MHRWS expansion sites to the already protected zone. Faunistic inventory and assessment documented 19 species of mammals belonging to 16 genera, eight families and five orders. This adds nine species to the previously reported mammals of Mt. Hamiguitan range making it a home to 30 species. Relatively low diversity of mammals (H’=0.615) in the expansion sites is attributed to poor soil resulting to low forest productivity and habitat loss due to mining, logging and shifting cultivation. This unique assemblage of vulnerable and endemic species of bats and mammals in Mt. Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary expansion sites calls for more sampling effort and conservation strategies to maintain its bat and mammal assemblage.",

            "abstractNote": "Metal-contaminated soils and sediments are widespread in urbanized areas due to atmospheric deposition close to emission sources. These metals are bio-available for organisms, e.g., insects, and accumulate in food chains of insectivorous mammals. Especially bats, which live in urban regions and ingest large amounts of food relative to their body mass, are at risk of being poisoned due to the accumulation of trace metals. To determine species-specific trace metal contents in bats from urban environments, hair samples were analyzed by ICP-OES. Observed trace metal concentrations were related to species-specific foraging habitat, prey spectrum and degree of synanthropy. The species studied were Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Myotis daubentonii and Nyctalus noctula. P. pipistrellus showed the highest concentrations of lead and zinc and slightly higher concentrations of cadmium than the other two species, which was related to its high degree of synanthropy with foraging habitat mostly located in cities. In contrast, N. noctula displayed the highest contents of manganese and copper. The reason might be found in its prey spectrum, as N. noctula feeds mainly on beetles that are caught in cultured areas. Trace metal concentrations determined in hair samples of M. daubentonii ranged between the values of P. pipistrellus and N. noctula, probably reflecting an intermediate level of synanthropy. Positive correlations were observed between the concentrations of cadmium and lead and those of manganese and copper. Hair samples from bats are suitable monitoring tools to study trace metal exposure and can be used to determine differences in trace metal levels between species.",

This information is supplemented by new data from more recent field-based ethnobiological research in Nage and other parts of Flores, and is analyzed comparatively with reference to ideas about Chiropterans from other parts of the world. The way Nage and other Flores Islanders treat bats may appear cross-culturally unusual, but their ideas are shown to fit within a range of ways humans think about these remarkable creatures. In a more general vein, attention is given to the widely recognized morphological and behavioral ambiguity of bats and the variable extent to which this ambiguity affects their representation—both in folk zoological classification (or ethnotaxonomy) and symbolic thought (including taboo, spiritual belief, myth, and metaphor). A comparative analysis also demonstrates how, by contrast to the stereotypical view of bats as embodiments of evil in European thought, both Westerners and non-Westerners can represent bats positively, and that even where a generally negative view prevails, bats can possess a positive value contextually.",

Making headlines worldwide during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, bats were all too often accused of carrying and transmitting a disproportionate share of dangerous viruses. We enquired about the origin and persistence of this thinking in Sweden by searching old literature and original museum records where bats are mentioned. In the Bible, the bat is an explicitly unclean animal. At least since the Middle Ages, it has been used as a symbol of the Devil, with the dark skin wings in deliberate contrast to the white wings of angels. However, according to our folklore records, the bat was usually seen in a different and generally positive context by the people, and was treated with respect. Its magic properties, particularly contained in the blood, eyes, and wings, could bring fortune and prevent bad luck in various everyday contexts. A minority of records refer to bats being used in witchcraft, black magic, or, following the religious dogma, claiming that they are ugly or unclean and cannot be the work of God. We found no indication that bats were considered aggressive, dangerous, or to carry disease. Hence, we surmise there was little fear of bats in Swedish (Nordic) history, despite the religious message. Hence, the general attitude towards bats in the past seems to have been opposite to the view currently met in Western societies.",

            "abstractNote": "Chiroptophobia, or the fear of bats, which encompasses negative perceptions of bats as disease vectors, pests, or harmful creatures associated with evil spirits, represents an important barrier to bat conservation globally. Derived largely from the influence of Western cultural perceptions, it ignores the diverse cultural perceptions of bats from other regions, which have been largely overlooked. To better understand local beliefs and cultural perceptions regarding bats across the Asia-Pacific region, and how they may help design culturally grounded conservation strategies, we conducted a review of publications in the English-language literature documenting cultural value of bats in Asia-Pacific traditions. We discovered 119 bat cultural values in 60 different cultures from 24 countries across the region and found a wide spectrum of reports, which we categorized according to five wildlife value categories and further categorized these values according to positive, neutral, and negative. We found that 62% of the cultures had only positive values, 8% had only neutral values, while 10% had only negative values. This suggests that the Asia-Pacific region and its cultures contain far more positive associations with bats than most Western societies and, as such, offer promising examples and opportunities to promote human-bat coexistence. However, we also discuss how local belief systems may not always align with daily practices or conservation objectives. We suggest employing targeted, culturally grounded and locally contextualized outreach strategies in order to carry out more effective bat conservation and education in Asia-Pacific countries.",

Cambodia represents an important case study for studying humanbat interactions, as loss of karst caves and the destruction of forests threaten the stability of bat populations and the ecosystem services they provide. Cambodians rely on bats for tourism revenue, fertilizer from guano, and as a source of protein. However, there is a lack of information on people’s attitudes towards and relationships with cave-roosting bats. In 2018, we interviewed 60 residents around three karst outcrops (Sampeau Hill, Banan Hill, and Reichiatra Hill) in Battambang Province, northwestern Cambodia, along with agricultural professionals in Battambang Town, the province’s capital. The primary objectives of the interviews were to examine people’s (1) attitudes towards bats, (2) experiences with bats, and (3) engagement in high-risk behaviors associated with transmission of bat-related diseases (e.g., guano mining, hunting, etc.). Most respondents (70%) held positive attitudes towards bats and listed guano production, pest control, and tourism as benefits bats provide. Additionally, all informants believed bats should be protected and stated that they would feel sad if bats were extirpated. Conversely, respondents noted that many people eat bats. We followed these semi-structured interviews with five key informant interviews involved with the conservation of bats, which provided information on the history of human-bat interactions within these communities. Respondents’ positive attitudes towards bats and recognition of ecosystem services bats provide indicate they would support bat conservation policy and may be interested in developing communitybased conservation programs around karst outcrops.",

            "abstractNote": "Background:  Fruit bats play an important role in pollination and seed dispersal, and their conservation is important to maintain the productivity of some crops and natural ecosystems. The objective of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitudes, and perception of fruit bats by orchard farmers and agricultural communities in Pakistan.\nMethods:  The present survey was conducted in two districts (i.e. Sheikhupura and Malakand districts) within Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces based on the higher number of fruit growing areas and bat roosting sites. A total of 200 (100 per district) close-ended questionnaires with 53 questions were administered to randomly selected respondents within the selected communities associated with fruit orchards, including orchard owners, laborers, and members of the surrounding community. Each questionnaire was divided into seven sections (i.e., demographic information, environmental and public health effects of bats, knowledge about bats, perception and control of bats, non-lethal methods adopted to control bats, and different myths about bats).\nResults:  A majority of respondents (59%, n = 118) mis-classified bats as birds instead of mammals despite more than 84% reporting that they have observed bats. Nearly 71.5% of orchard farmers perceived that their fruits are contaminated by bats during consumption, and a majority believe that bats destroy orchards (62.5%) and are responsible for spreading disease. Mythology about bats was ambiguous, as 49% of those surveyed did not perceived bats to bring good luck (49%), and 50% did not perceived them to be bad omens either. Most respondents have never killed a bat (68%) nor would they kill a bat if given the opportunity (95%). Regarding the control of bats, the greatest percentage of respondents strongly disagree with shooting bats (36%) and strongly agree with leaving bats alone (42.5%).\nConclusions:  This study provides a better understanding of the sociodemographic factors associated with knowledge, attitude and perception of bats from fruit orchard owners, labourers and local people. We recommend educational interventions for targeted groups in the community, highlighting the ecosystem services and importance of bat conservation to improve people’s current knowledge regarding the role of bats and reduce direct persecution against bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding patterns and motivations for social spacing greatly illuminates the structure and internal dynamics of given groups or social systems. The highly social, polygynous greater sac-winged bat, Saccopteryx bilineata, represents an excellent model for social spacing analysis, since the choice of individual roost-sites within a day-roost constitutes an enduring, often repeated decision about relative proximity to conspeciﬁcs. Day-roost colonies consist of one or multiple harem groups, each with several females and a single male. Additionally, non-harem males without females may be present. A social-distance–time-budget metric revealed that harem males, females, and non-harem males differed signiﬁcantly in their respective spatial associations while roosting. Harem males and females were most closely associated, with harem males located at the center of harems instead of at the borders. Non-harem males associated signiﬁcantly closer with one another than with harem females that they were trying to access. The signaling modality mediating social interactions depended on the respective social distances between communicating bats. Our results suggest a concentric social organization based around harem males, which may select roost sites in closest possible proximity to females to enhance courtship signal strength. This constitutes an interesting deviation from the normative form of harem maintenance, patrolling borders, in mammals.",

During winter, the absence of dietary substrates in fat storing hibernators leads to a reduction in the mass of fats and digestive organs. We examined the seasonal changes in body mass and activity of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and small intestine of the torpid Eptesicus nilssonii (Keyserling & Blasius, 1839). Adult females and males were captured in autumn (November, early hibernation), winter (February, mid hibernation) and spring (March–April, late hibernation) in northwestern Russia (Republic of Karelia). Our findings indicated that male and female E. nilssonii reduced body mass during hibernation, but females exhibited a slower decline in body mass during hibernation period than males. No significant differences in the activity of digestive enzymes were found between males and females. Pancreatic protease activity was the highest in autumn, decreased in the mid hibernation season, and remained low during hibernation of E. nilssonii. There was no difference in the activity of amylase and lipase in the pancreas among all periods of hibernation. However, the activity of protease, amylase and lipase in small intestine was higher before the emergence from hibernation in spring than during autumn. This study provides new information of the maintenance of intestinal hydrolytic enzyme activity after months of fasting. E. nilssonii, a fat storing hibernator, appears to maintain a digestive function during the hibernation season, apparently to allow efficient absorption of nutrients that are ingested after terminal arousal in the spring.",

Correlations of variation in CF with variation in body size, body condition, environmental humidity and presence of ecologically similar species are studied in an attempt to identify the forces driving the evolution of CF. We found that bats may adapt the frequency to humidity, and that CF may evolve under interspeci®c interactions, either of ecological or of social nature. The results support an adaptive value for the high values of CF, and challenge the `Allotonic Frequency Hypothesis'. We found correlation between frequency and a body condition index, which may trigger social selection processes in this species sexually dimorphic in CF. Combined social and environmental selection on CF could trigger diversi®cation of bats along ecotones separating habitats with contrasting air humidity.",

Using two-way, sides-by-individuals ANOVA, four components of variation were estimated for each bilateral variable: individual variation (I), directional asymmetry (DA), non-directional asymmetry (NDA) and measurement error (E). Both species exhibit similar major trends of variation in asymmetry across characters, as shown by principal component analysis, using variance components as variables. Degree of interspeci®c congruence among characters was con®rmed by a two-way ANOVA with species and variance components as ®xed factors. Congruence of asymmetry patterns between species suggests that the concept of population asymmetry parameter (PAP) could be extended to higher hierarchies. PAPs above the species level may result from common mechanisms or similar developmental constraints acting on species' buffering capacities and morphological integration processes.",

Males of some species may change tactics depending on age, body condition and social environment. Many bat species are polygynous where a fraction of males only have access to fertile females. For polygynous bats, knowledge of the reproductive success of males using different ARTs is scarce, and it remains unclear how age of males is related to switching decisions between social statuses. We studied a large captive population of Carollia perspicillata, where males are either harem holders, bachelors or peripheral males. Using a multistate procedure, we modelled the age-related switches in reproductive tactics and in survival probability. From the model, we calculated the reproductive success and the frequencies of males displaying different reproductive tactics. As in mammals, the switch between social statuses is often related to age, we predicted that the transition probability of bachelor and peripheral males to harem status would increase with age. We show, however, that social status transition towards a harem holding position was not related to age. Reproductive success changed with age and social status. Harem males had a signiﬁcantly higher reproductive success than bachelor males except between a short period from 3.8 to 4.4 years of age where success was similar, and a signiﬁcantly higher reproductive success than peripheral males between 2.6 and 4.4 years of age. Harem males showed a clear decrease in the probability of maintaining social status with age, which suggests that senescence reduces resource holding potential.",

Even in relatively loose host–parasite relationships, such as between generalist ectoparasites and their hosts, we may observe some degree of specialization of parasite populations to one of the multiple potential hosts. Salivary proteins are used by blood-feeding ectoparasites to prevent hemostasis in the host and maximize energy intake. We investigated the inﬂuence of association with speciﬁc host species on allele frequencies of salivary protein genes in Cimex adjunctus, a generalist blood-feeding ectoparasite of bats in North America. We analysed two salivary protein genes: an apyrase, which hydrolyses ATP at the feeding site and thus inhibits platelet aggregation, and a nitrophorin, which brings nitrous oxide to the feeding site, inhibiting platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. We observed more variation at both salivary protein genes among parasite populations associated with different host species than among populations from different spatial locations associated with the same host species. The variation in salivary protein genes among populations on different host species was also greater than expected under a neutral scenario of genetic drift and gene ﬂow. Finally, host species was an important predictor of allelic divergence in genotypes of individual C. adjunctus at both salivary protein genes. Our results suggest differing selection pressures on these two salivary protein genes in C. adjunctus depending on the host species.",

The basic role of respiration, in gas exchange and in the maintenance of physiological homeostasis under exercise stress, must be achieved in a way that is compatible not only with the rhythmic contraction of powerful flightmuscles but also with the continual production of high-intensity vocalizations necessary for acoustic orientation. Moreover, the demand for accurate navigational information is often greatest during the stresses of rapid erratic flight. At such times bats continually emit brief, high-intensity orientation sounds at repetition rates varying from a few to many per second. Nothing is known regarding the relationship between respiration, sound production and wing movements during flight, or the extent to which changes in pulse-repetition rate affects respiration.",

The mean body weight (W) ranged from 5 g in Pipistrellus pipistrellus to 173g in Cheiromeles torquatus; the lung volume (VL) ranged from 0·3 cm3 in Pipistrellus to 10 cm3 in Cheiromeles. The volume densities or the main components of the bat lung, namely the parenchyma [Vv(p,L)] (the gas exchange region) and the nonparenchyma [Vv(np,L)], were closely similar, the Vv(p,L) constituting a mean value of 84·2% and the Vv(np,L) 15·8% in the five species. The VL, the surface area of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier (St), the pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc), and the total morphometric pulmonary diffusing capacity were all strongly correlated with body weight. The harmonic mean thickness of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier (τht) and the surface density of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier [Sv(t,p)] were poorly correlated with W. The bats had a remarkably higher VL than either birds or terrestrial mammals. The Vc in the bat lung was similar to that in the bird lung but higher than that of the terrestrial mammals. The bats had a more extensive St than either the birds or the terrestrial mammals. In the bats the τht was thicker than in the birds but thinner than that of the terrestrial mammals. These pulmonary structural adaptations culminated in a higher in the bat than either in the birds or in the terrestrial mammals. The superior morphometric properties of the bat lung coupled with the established physiological adaptations may help to explain how the bat lung is capable of providing the immense amount of oxygen demanded by flight.",

We recorded auditory receptor cell action potentials elicited in underwing moths (Catocala spp.) by echolocation calls emitted during gleaning attacks by Myotis septentrionalis (the northern long-eared bat) and during ﬂights by the aerial hawker Myotis lucifugus (the little brown bat). The moth ear responds inconsistently and with fewer action potentials to the echolocation calls emitted by the gleaner, a situation that worsened when the moth’s ear was covered by its wing (mimicking a moth resting on a surface). Calls emitted by the aerial-hawking bat elicited a signiﬁcantly stronger spiking response from the moth ear. Moths with their ears covered by their wings maintained their relative hearing sensitivity at their best frequency range, the range used by most aerial insectivorous bats, but showed a pronounced deafness in the frequency range typically employed by gleaning bats. Our results (1) support the prediction that the echolocation calls of gleaners are acoustically inconspicuous to the ears of moths (and presumably other nocturnal tympanate insects), leaving the moths particularly vulnerable to predation, and (2) suggest that gleaners gain a foraging advantage against eared prey.",

We compared pinna gain, directionality of hearing and interaural intensity differences (IID) in echolocating and non-echolocating bats, in species using different echolocation strategies and in species that depend upon prey-generated sounds to locate their targets. In the Pteropodidae, two echolocating species had slightly higher directionality than a non-echolocating species. The ears of phyllostomid and vespertilionid species showed moderate directionality. In the Mormoopidae, the ear directionality of Pteronotus parnellii clearly matched the dominant spectral component of its echolocation calls, unlike the situation in three other species. Species in the Emballonuridae, Molossidae, Rhinopomatidae and two vespertilionids that use narrow-band search-phase echolocation calls showed increasingly sharp tuning of the pinna to the main frequency of their signals. Similar tuning was most evident in Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae, species specialized for ﬂutter detection via Doppler-shifted echoes of high-duty-cycle narrowband signals. The large pinnae of bats that use prey-generated sounds to ﬁnd their targets supply high sound pressure gain at lower frequencies. Increasing domination of a narrow spectral band in echolocation is reﬂected in the passive acoustic properties of the external ears (sharper directionality). The importance of IIDs for lateralization and horizontal localization is discussed by comparing the behavioural directional performance of bats with their bioacoustical features.",

All species showed similar call intensities of between 80 and 90 dB peSPL (peak equivalent SPL) at 1 m during ﬂight except Plecotus auritus, whose call intensity was between 68 and 77 dB peSPL at 1 m. Calls from stationary bats were about 13 dB less intense than calls during ﬂight. A method is proposed to measure the root mean square (rms) amplitude of echolocation calls and, hence, to calculate the energy ﬂux density of the call. The constant-frequency calls of Rhinolophus hipposideros have energy ﬂux densities approximately ten times higher than those of bats using frequency-modulated calls as a result of their longer durations and lower crest factors. It is argued that the low-intensity calls of P. auritus allow it to approach tympanate moths more closely before triggering their escape response.",

In all species, surface areas and other structural quantities tended to be greatest at more cranial sites and to decline caudally. The entomophagous bat (Miniopterus inflatus) had a mean body mass (coefficient of variation) of 8.9 g (5 %) and a mean intestinal length of 20 cm (6 %). The surface area of the basic intestinal tube (primary mucosa) was 9.1 cm2 (10 %) but this was amplified to 48 cm2 (13 %) by villi and to 0.13 m2 (20 %) by microvilli. The total number of microvilli per intestine was 4×1011 (20 %). The average microvillus had a diameter of 89 nm (10 %), a length of 1.1 μm (22 %) and a membrane surface area of 0.32 μm2 (31 %). In two species of fruit bats (Epomophorus wahlbergi and Lisonycteris angolensis), body masses were greater and intestines longer, the values being 76.0 g (18 %) and 76.9 g (4 %), and 73 cm (16 %) and 72 cm (7 %), respectively. Surface areas were also greater, amounting to 76 cm2 (26 %) and 45 cm2 (8 %) for the primary mucosa, 547 cm2 (29 %) and 314 cm2 (16 %) for villi and 2.7 m2 (23 %) and 1.5 m2 (18 %) for microvilli. An increase in the number of microvilli, 33×1011 (19 %) and 15×1011 (24 %) per intestine, contributed to the more extensive surface area but there were concomitant changes in the dimensions of microvilli. Mean diameters were 94 nm (8 %) and 111 nm (4 %), and mean lengths were 2.8 μm (12 %) and 2.9 μm (10 %), respectively. Thus, an increase in the surface area of the average microvillus to 0.83 μm2 (12 %) and 1.02 μm2 (11 %) also contributed to the greater total surface area of microvilli. The lifestyle-related differences in total microvillous surface areas persisted when structural quantities were normalised for the differences in body masses. The values for total microvillous surface area were 148 cm2 g−1 (20 %) in the entomophagous bat, 355 cm2 g−1 (20 %) in E. wahlbergi and 192 cm2 g−1 (17 %) in L. angolensis. This was true despite the fact that the insect-eater possessed a greater length of intestine per unit of body mass: 22 mm g−1 (8 %) versus 9–10 mm g−1 (9–10 %) for the fruit-eaters.",

There is probably a (frequency, duration and repetition rate) in bats in a trade-off between call intensity and repetition rate because functional context. Low-duty-cycle bats operate with ‘whispering’ bats (and hipposiderids) produce several calls search phase cycles of usually less than 20 %. They process per predicted wingbeat and because batches of calls are echoes in the time domain and are therefore intolerant of emitted per wingbeat during terminal buzzes. Severe pulse–echo overlap. High-duty-cycle (>30 %) species use atmospheric attenuation at high frequencies limits the Doppler shift compensation, and they separate pulse and range of high-frequency calls. Low-duty-cycle bats that call echo in the frequency domain. Call frequency scales at high frequencies must therefore use short pulses to avoid negatively with body mass in at least ﬁve bat families. Pulse pulse–echo overlap. Rhinolophids escape this constraint by duration scales positively with mass in low-duty-cycle Doppler shift compensation and, importantly, can exploit quasi-constant-frequency (QCF) species because the large advantages associated with the emission of both highaerial-hawking species that emit these signals ﬂy fast in frequency and long-duration calls. Low frequencies are open habitats. They therefore detect distant targets and unsuited for the detection of small prey, and low repetition experience pulse–echo overlap later than do smaller bats. rates may limit prey detection rates. Echolocation Pulse duration also scales positively with mass in the parameters may therefore constrain maximum body size in Hipposideridae, which show at least partial Doppler shift aerial-hawking bats.",

Because turnover rates of carbon isotopes are related to metabolic rate, we wanted to determine the rates at which carbon isotopes are exchanged in tissues of two species of nectarfeeding bats (Leptonycteris curasoae and Glossophaga soricina), both of which have relatively high mass-speciﬁc metabolic rates. To test the hypothesis that isotope turnover is higher in nectar-feeding bats, because of their high mass-speciﬁc metabolic rates, than in other eutherian mammals, we conducted diet-switching experiments and chose three target tissues (hair, wing membrane and blood) to evaluate the isotopic turnover rates. We made the following predictions: (1) isotopic composition should change towards higher δ13C-values due to the turnover of carbon isotopes of C3 origin with those of C4/CAM origin; (2) the turnover rates of carbon isotopes would differ between the three types of tissues in the following order of decreasing turnover rates: blood>wing membrane>hair; and (3) turnover rates of nectar-feeding bats should exceed those reported for other small mammals because of the high mass-speciﬁc metabolic rate of nectar-feeding bats. Compared to the initial diet, target tissues were enriched in heavy carbon isotopes by 2.8‰ in L. curasoae and by 2.6‰ in G. soricina. After changing the diet from C3 to C4/CAM origin we found an increase in abundance of 13C in blood and wing membrane in all experimental subjects. The estimated half life of carbon isotope turnover ranged from 100 to 134 days and did not differ signiﬁcantly between blood and wing membrane, nor did it differ between the two species. The low turnover rate in wing membrane may reﬂect its speciﬁc composition and the relatively low temperature of this tissue, and long-lived erythrocytes in bat blood may be responsible for the low turnover rate of carbon isotopes in blood. The turnover rate of stable carbon isotopes in hair was low in L. curasoae and undetectable in G. soricina, which may be explained by the seasonal growth of the hair in these two species. Because both species are small (10 and 25·g, respectively) and nectar-feeding bats have higher massspeciﬁc metabolic rates than bats in temperate regions or similar sized terrestrial mammals, our ﬁndings of low turnover rates were unexpected.",

Groups of silvery-white male H. humuli perform a short (30 min) hovering display ﬂight over grassland at dusk. They typically hover at, or below, the tops of grass panicles and are therefore situated in a highly acoustically cluttered habitat. Occasionally, they move to a new position by making short (1–5 s) ﬂights at higher levels. E. nilssonii is not a clutter specialist, and yet we found that they attacked H. humuli within the ‘clutter overlap zone’. The bats did not change their signal design in any marked manner for this speciﬁc task. Measurements of echoes from a moth 10 cm above or below the grass tops showed that information for detecting the moths was available to the bats. Nevertheless, the bats did not attack moths in stationary hovering display ﬂight, only when they moved above the grass panicles. The duration of the up/down ﬂights (movements) were almost always longer than an entire capture sequence by the bats. Apparently, the bats rely on the movement of the moth in space, monitored over successive echoes, to discriminate moth echoes from overlapping clutter echoes.",

Three bats of the species Eptesicus fuscus were trained to ﬂy through a hole in a mist net to receive a food reward on the other side. In all experiments, the vocal behavior of the bats was recorded simultaneously using a high-speed video recording system, allowing for a 3D reconstruction of the ﬂight path. We ran three types of experiments, with different spatial relations between the landmark and net hole. In the ﬁrst experiment, the bat’s behavior was studied in test trials with the landmark placed 10·cm to the left of the net opening; between test trials, the positions of the net opening and landmark were moved, but the spatial relationship between the two remained ﬁxed. With the landmark adjacent to the net opening, the bats quickly found the hole. In the second experiment, bats were tested in control trials in which the landmark was moved independently of the hole, breaking the established spatial relationship between the two. In control trials the bats repeatedly crashed into the net next to the landmark, and inspected the area around it. In the ﬁnal experiment, the landmark was removed altogether from the set-up. Here the bats spent more time per trial searching for the net opening with an increased number of inspections as well as crashes into the net. However, over the course of a test day without the landmark, bats reduced the time spent per trial and focused inspections and crashes around the hole. The behavioral data show for the ﬁrst time that the echolocating bat can learn to rely on an acoustic landmark to guide spatial orientation.",

            "abstractNote": "Summary Two decades ago D. J. Keegan reported results on Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus, Megachiroptera) that were strangely at odds with the prevailing understanding of how glucose is absorbed in the mammalian intestine. Keegan’s in vitro tests for glucose transport against a concentration gradient and with phloridzin inhibition in fruit bat intestine were all negative, although he used several different tissue preparations and had positive control results with laboratory rats. Because glucose absorption by fruit bats is nonetheless efficient, Keegan postulated that the rapid glucose absorption from the fruit bat intestine is not through the enterocytes, but must occur via spaces between the cells. Thus, we hypothesized that absorption of water-soluble compounds that are not actively transported would be extensive in these bats, and would decline with increasing molecular mass in accord with sieve-like paracellular absorption. We did not presume from Keegan’s studies that there is no Na+-coupled, mediated sugar transport in these bats, and our study was not designed to rule it out, but rather to quantify the level of possible non-mediated absorption. Using a standard pharmacokinetic technique, we fed, or injected intraperitonealy, the metabolically inert carbohydrates Lrhamnose (molecular mass=164·Da) and cellobiose (molecular mass=342·Da), which are absorbed by paracellular uptake, and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3OMDglucose), a D-glucose analog that is absorbed via both mediated (active) and paracellular uptake. As predicted, the bioavailability of paracellular probes declined with increasing molecular mass (rhamnose, 62±4%; cellobiose, 22±4%) and was significantly higher in bats than has been reported for rats and other mammals. In addition, fractional absorption of 3OMD-glucose was high (91±2%). We estimated that Egyptian fruit bats rely on passive, paracellular absorption for the majority of their glucose absorption (at least 55% of 3OMD-glucose absorption), much more than in non-flying mammals.",

However, δ13Cbreath is sensitive to changes in ingested food items and the mixed combustion of exogenous and endogenous substrates. Therefore, experiments under controlled conditions are pivotal for the correct interpretation of δ13Cbreath of free-ranging animals. We measured δ13Cbreath in fasted and recently fed insectivorous Myotis myotis (Chiroptera) to assess the residence time of carbon isotopes in the pool of metabolized substrate, and whether δ13Cbreath in satiated individuals levels off at values similar to the dietary isotope signature (δ13Cdiet) in insect-feeding mammals. Mean δ13Cbreath of fasted individuals was depleted by –5.8‰ (N=6) in relation to δ13Cdiet. After feeding on insects, bats exchanged 50% of carbon atoms in the pool of metabolized substrates within 21.6±10.5 min, which was slower than bats ingesting simple carbohydrates. After 2 h, δ13Cbreath of satiated bats levelled off at –2.6‰ below δ13Cdiet, suggesting that bats combusted both exogenous and endogenous substrate at this time. A literature survey revealed that small birds and mammals metabolize complex macronutrients at slower rates than simple macronutrients. On average, δ13Cbreath of fasting birds and mammals was depleted in 13C by –3.2±2.0‰ in relation to δ13Cdiet. δ13Cbreath of satiated animals differed by –0.6±2.3‰ from δ13Cdiet when endogenous substrates were not in isotopic equilibrium with exogenous substrates and by +0.5±1.8‰ (N=6 species) after endogenous substrates were in isotopic equilibrium with exogenous substrates.",

            "abstractNote": "Previous studies reported that fed bats and birds mostly use recently acquired exogenous nutrients as fuel for flight, rather than endogenous fuels, such as lipids or glycogen. However, this pattern of fuel use may be a simple size-related phenomenon because, to date, only small birds and bats have been studied with respect to the origin of metabolized fuel, and because small animals carry relatively small energy reserves, considering their high mass-specific metabolic rate. We hypothesized that ~150g Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus Pteropodidae), which are more than an order of magnitude heavier than previously studied bats, also catabolize dietary sugars directly and exclusively to fuel both rest and flight metabolism. We based our expectation on the observation that these animals rapidly transport ingested dietary sugars, which are absorbed via passive paracellular pathways in the intestine, to organs of high energy demand. We used the stable carbon isotope ratio in exhaled CO2 (13Cbreath) to assess the origin of metabolized substrates in 16 Egyptian fruit bats that were maintained on a diet of C3 plants before experiments. First, we predicted that in resting bats 13Cbreath remains constant when bats ingest C3 sucrose, but increases and converges on the dietary isotopic signature when C4 sucrose and C4 glucose are ingested. Second, if flying fruit bats use exogenous nutrients exclusively to fuel flight, we predicted that 13Cbreath of flying bats would converge on the isotopic signature of the C4 sucrose they were fed. Both resting and flying Egyptian fruit bats, indeed, directly fuelled their metabolism with freshly ingested exogenous substrates. The rate at which the fruit bats oxidized dietary sugars was as fast as in 10g nectar-feeding bats and 5g hummingbirds. Our results support the notion that flying bats, irrespective of their size, catabolize dietary sugars directly, and possibly exclusively, to fuel flight.",

In this study we analyzed the three-dimensional flight paths and echolocation behavior of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) attacking B. trigona in a flight room over seven consecutive nights to determine the acoustic mechanism of the sonar-jamming defense. Three mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the phantom echo hypothesis, which states that bats misinterpret moth clicks as echoes; (2) the ranging interference hypothesis, which states that moth clicks degrade the bats’ precision in determining target distance; and (3) the masking hypothesis, which states that moth clicks mask the moth echoes entirely, making the moth temporarily invisible. On nights one and two of the experiment, the bats appeared startled by the clicks; however, on nights three through seven, the bats frequently missed their prey by a distance predicted by the ranging interference hypothesis (~15–20cm). Three-dimensional simulations show that bats did not avoid phantom targets, and the bats’ ability to track clicking prey contradicts the predictions of the masking hypothesis. The moth clicks also forced the bats to reverse their stereotyped pattern of echolocation emissions during attack, even while bats continued pursuit of the moths. This likely further hinders the bats’ ability to track prey. These results have implications for the evolution of sonar jamming in tiger moths, and we suggest evolutionary pathways by which sonar jamming may have evolved from other tiger moth defense mechanisms.",

All study bats jumped using a similar technique, with the wing musculature providing the force. The bats jumped off the wrist joint of their wings, typically with their feet already off the ground. Contrary to expectations, jump performance did not correlate with ecology and was instead strongly determined by body size. In general, the larger bats produced more jump force, left the ground at higher speeds and jumped higher than the smaller bats. The differences in force production disappeared when the data were corrected for body size, with the exception of Myotis capaccinii, which produced significantly less force. Scaling of jump performance with body size measured here was compared against two existing muscle performance scaling models. The model suggesting that muscle contraction velocity is proportional to muscle length was better supported than that based on muscle cross-sectional area. Both models, however, failed to accurately predict the scaling of jump forces, with the slope of the relationship being significantly steeper than predicted, highlighting the need for further investigations of vertebrate muscle performance scaling. The results of this study indicate that a bat’s jumping ability is a secondary locomotor ability that uses the strongly selected-for flight apparatus with no apparent ecological trend present, i.e. flight so dominates bat locomotor morphology that other locomotor abilities tend to be derivative.",

To determine whether differences exist in bat flight behaviour, prey handling and echolocation characteristics when catching fish and insects of different size, we conducted a field experiment focused on the last stage of prey capture. We used synchronized video and ultrasound recordings to measure several flight and dip features as well as echolocation characteristics, focusing on terminal buzz phase I, characterized by a call rate exceeding 100 Hz, and buzz phase II, characterized by a drop in the fundamental well below 20 kHz and a repetition rate exceeding 150 Hz. When capturing insects, bats used both parts of the terminal phase to the same extent, and performed short and superficial drags on the water surface. In contrast, when preying on fish, buzz I was longer and buzz II shorter, and the bats made longer and deeper dips. These variations suggest that lengthening buzz I and shortening buzz II when fishing is beneficial, probably because buzz I gives better discrimination ability and the broader sonar beam provided by buzz II is useless when no evasive flight of the prey is expected. Additionally, bats continued emitting calls beyond the theoretical signal-overlap zone, suggesting that they might obtain information even when they have surpassed that threshold, at least initially. This study shows that M. capaccinii can regulate the temporal components of its feeding buzzes and modify prey capture technique according to the target.",

Digestive physiology limits the energy intake of several glossophaginid bats, and could play an important role in the onset of torpor in these tropical animals. We measured the effect that diet quality and Ta had on the use of torpor by the nectar-feeding bats Glossophaga soricina and Leptonycteris yerbabuenae. Captive bats were fed with 5% (low) or 35% (high) sucrose solutions while exposed to two different Ta (17.7 and 23.2°C; low Ta and high Ta) in four different treatments: (1) high sucrose:high Ta, (2) high sucrose:low Ta, (3) low sucrose:high Ta and (4) low sucrose:low Ta. We measured their energy intake, changes in body mass (ΔMb) and skin temperature (Tskin) as response variables. Energy intake (in 10 h) was limited when both species fed on 5% sucrose, but body mass gain was only affected in G. soricina. Energy intake and Ta had a negative effect on the minimum Tskin of both species, and ΔMb affected the time that G. soricina used torpor. Both species remained normothermic on the high sucrose:high Ta treatment, but used torpor on the other three treatments. Bats used torpor during their resting and activity periods. Leptonycteris yerbabuenae spent more time in torpor in the low sucrose:high Ta treatment, while G. soricina used this strategy for longer periods of time in the high sucrose:low Ta treatment. We found that diet quality and Ta played an important role in the use of torpor by nectar-feeding bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Echolocating bats have historically been classified as either loud aerial hawkers or whispering gleaners. Some bat species can forage in multiple ways and others have demonstrated limited flexibility in the amplitude of their echolocation calls. The desert long-eared bat, Otonycteris hemprichii, has been said to be a passive gleaning whispering bat preying on terrestrial arthropods such as scorpions. Using an acoustic tracking system, we recorded individuals flying at foraging and drinking sites and compared their flight height, flight speed, call duration, pulse interval and source levels with those of gleaning individuals previously recorded using the same setup. We found differences in all variables with the strongest difference in source levels, where bats called at a mean of 119 dB peSPL (compared with 75 dB peSPL when gleaning). Bat faecal analysis indicated that their diet differed from previous studies and that prey species were capable of flight. We conclude that the bats switched from passive gleaning to capturing airborne insects (aerial hawking). Although whispering bats have been known to opportunistically catch insects on the wing, in the present study we show a full bimodal switch between foraging guilds with the respective changes in source level to those typical of a true aerial hawker.",

            "abstractNote": "Many sexual displays contain multiple components that are received through a variety of sensory modalities. Primary and secondary signal components can interact to induce novel receiver responses and become targets of sexual selection as complex signals. However, predators can also use these complex signals for prey assessment, which may limit the evolution of elaborate sexual signals. We tested whether a multimodal sexual display of the male túngara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) increases predation risk from the fringelipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus) when compared with a unimodal display. We gave bats a choice to attack one of two frog models: a model with a vocal sac moving in synchrony with a mating call (multisensory cue), or a control model with the call but no vocal sac movement (unimodal cue). Bats preferred to attack the model associated with the multimodal display. Furthermore, we determined that bats perceive the vocal sac using echolocation rather than visual cues. Our data illustrate the costs associated with multimodal signaling and that sexual and natural selection pressures on the same trait are not always mediated through the same sensory modalities. These data are important when considering the role of environmental fluctuations on signal evolution as different sensory modalities will be differentially affected.",

Here, we examine mechanisms used by echolocating bats to localize objects, track small prey and communicate in complex and noisy acoustic environments. Bats actively control and coordinate both the emission and reception of sound stimuli through integrated sensory and motor mechanisms that have evolved together over tens of millions of years. We discuss how bats behave in different ecological scenarios, including detecting and discriminating target echoes from background objects, minimizing acoustic interference from competing conspecifics and overcoming insect noise. Bats tackle these problems by deploying a remarkable array of auditory behaviors, sometimes in combination with the use of other senses. Behavioral strategies such as ceasing sonar call production and active jamming of the signals of competitors provide further insight into the capabilities and limitations of echolocation. We relate these findings to the broader topic of how animals extract relevant sensory information in noisy environments. While bats have highly refined abilities for operating under noisy conditions, they face the same challenges encountered by many other species. We propose that the specialized sensory mechanisms identified in bats are likely to occur in analogous systems across the animal kingdom.",
