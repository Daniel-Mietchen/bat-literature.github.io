Landscapes were situated in the Ozark Mountains, USA, and consisted of a fragmented, agricultural landscape and a contiguous national forest. We captured 8720 moths constituting !314 species and 22 families. Pastures demonstrated a lower abundance and richness of moths than other habitats in the fragmented landscape ( p < 0.05). Neither abundance nor richness of moths varied by habitat in the forested landscape, but we did observe variation among roost locations ( p < 0.05). Abundant families of moths (n ! 100 specimens captured) did vary in abundance among habitats in both landscapes ( p < 0.05), with poletimber stands, riparian forest and upland forest selected, and pasture, forest edge, sawtimber and sapling stands avoided by at least one family of moths. Density and richness of woody plant species were correlated with the occurrence of moths at sampling sites. We recommend maintaining habitat heterogeneity around roosts of the Ozark big-eared bat to encourage an abundance and richness of moth prey, and suggest that forested riparian corridors are important habitat elements for Ozark big-eared bats foraging in fragmented landscapes.",

Throughout the 19-years-long monitoring period, a total of 5135 Rhinolophus hipposideros were counted in maternity roost, with a mean of 273 (SD = 198.1) per year (mean Piedmont = 73, SD = 85.9; mean Liguria = 200, SD = 164.6). The population analysis model shows a significant overall gradient of 1.047, which corresponds to an average annual increase of 4.7 % over the period considered. The analysis suggests that in the study area, the reproductive population of Rhinolophus hipposideros monitored in the maternity roost has increased throughout the period from 2000-2018, with large increases after 2010 and different trends occurring in the two regions considered, including a significant moderate increase in Liguria and a stable trend in Piedmont. The results agreed with the recently observed trends in other European countries for this species.",

            "abstractNote": "Forest managers are increasingly expected to incorporate biodiversity objectives within forest landscapes devoted to timber production. However, data on which to base management recommendations for bats within these systems are limited. Although the red bat (Lasiurus borealis) is a widespread and common species in temperate forests of North America, little is known of its ecology within intensively managed pine (Pinus spp.) forests of the southeastern United States. Diurnal roost sites of red bats may be limiting on industrial pine forests due to a lack of large hardwoods within managed stands. Therefore, we investigated selection of day roosts by red bats at multiple spatial scales during June–September 2000 and May–August 2001 in an intensively managed pine landscape in east-central Mississippi, USA. We captured bats using 4-tier mist nets placed over water and attached 0.47–0.54 g radiotransmitters to captured red bats (n ¼ 46). We located day roosts of red bats (n ¼ 141 roosts of 27 bats) for the life of the transmitters. Red bats roosted in 16 species of hardwood trees (70% of day roosts) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda; 30% of day roosts). In contrast to other studies in the southeastern United States, red bats roosted in pine trees and in midstory hardwood trees. Within thinned pine stands, red bats tended to prefer roost trees with a denser subcanopy and higher basal area as compared to random sites. Stand-level characteristics appeared more important than individual tree characteristics in choice of diurnal roosts. Except for adult males, logistic regression models of roost sites of red bats had high (!79%) correct classiﬁcation rates. Day roost site requirements of red bats may exhibit greater plasticity than previously thought. On our study area, intensive forest management appears compatible with diurnal roost needs of this species.",

We compared insectivorous bat activity and insect abundance at three heights (understorey, subcanopy and canopy), two locations (forest and track) and three time periods (evening, night and dawn), in old and young regrowth sites in south-eastern Australia (456 detector-hours). We measured activity levels of all bats and four echolocation guilds—one open-space and three edge-space aerial-foraging guilds. Mean bat activity in the subcanopy and canopy was up to 11 times that in the understorey of forests, a pattern opposite to that of insect abundance. However, bat activity in the two upper strata was lower in young regrowth than in old regrowth. Vegetation was more cluttered in young regrowth at these upper heights (closer stems and less vertical space in the subcanopy). Mean activity on the track was 2–5 times higher than in the forest, particularly at understorey level (17 times higher for all bats), where vegetation was less cluttered (more distant understorey trees and shrubs, and less cover of ground vegetation). Time of night had little effect on bat activity. The negative response of bat guilds to increased clutter was strongest in the open-space guild and weakest in the edge-space guild with the highest frequency calls. There was an interaction between insect abundance and an index of vegetation openness, with high values of both variables producing high bat activity levels for all bats and the two highest frequency call guilds. Our results highlight the need for management practices in logged forests that increase or preserve the amount of ﬂight and foraging space available to bats.",

In these landscapes, water occurs in numerous linear ditches and several small ponds (heliponds), used by helicopters for the suppression of forest ﬁres. Changes to the physical structure of water sources may be important to bats that use these sources for drinking and foraging. Therefore, we examined bat activity in a managed pine landscape and an adjacent natural wetland in relation to water source type (heliponds, ditches, and natural wetland) and insect abundance. We sampled bat activity using remote acoustic detectors; we sampled insects using passive traps. Insect abundance did not differ among water source types. Bat activity was most concentrated at modiﬁed water sources within the managed pine landscape (heliponds and ditches). Feeding activity was highest at heliponds. Heliponds and ditches were important sources of open water and insect prey for bats in the managed pine forest landscape. We suggest management for bats in similar forest landscapes should include maintenance of open and accessible water sources such as heliponds.",

            "abstractNote": "Studies on successional dynamics in tropical systems have mostly focused on plant communities and mainly have been conducted in tropical humid areas. Here, we document changes in the structure of bat assemblages among secondary successional stages of a neotropical dry forest. We speciﬁcally focused on the speciose phyllostomid bat family, comprising most of the foraging guilds found among neotropical bats, including nectarivores and frugivores that play important roles in processes of plant reproduction and forest regeneration. To investigate bat species richness, diversity and abundance during successionnal processes, we mist-netted bat assemblages in 12 sites belonging to 4 different successional stages, namely pastures (0 yrs), early (3–5 yrs), intermediate (8–12 yrs) and late successional stage (>50 yrs). A capture effort of 142 nights using ﬁve mist-nets per night yielded 606 phyllostomid bats belonging to 16 species. Late stage was the most speciose sustaining all species found in the study (16 species against 9 for early and intermediate stages and 4 in pastures), and was the only environment where rare species occurred. Species found within any one successional stage were a combination of species found at the previous stage plus additional ones. This additive pattern appeared to be driven by the natural abundance of species, as the abundant species were found across more succesisonal stages than rarer species. Bats were signiﬁcantly less speciose and less abundant in pastures, regardless of the foraging guild. Bat diversity and abundance did not differ signiﬁcantly among early, intermediate and late stages. However, nectarivores were more abundant in early compared to late stage, probably as a consequence of differences in patterns of food availability. We conclude that areas of forest, recognized as late stage in our study, are the most important reservoirs of species richness. Secondary vegetation also contains diverse bat assemblages, while pastures only harbour a few abundant and vagile species occasionally crossing this habitat. We suggest that land-use regulations in this region focus on maintaining connectivity of a mosaic of areas of secondary and mature vegetation to insure the conservation of bat diversity as well as their important ecological interactions.",

            "abstractNote": "Determining the way in which spatial distribution and diversity of forest-dwelling mammals varies with natural disturbance is essential to understanding the spatial dynamics of mammal assemblages in forests. Bats are the only forest-dwelling mammals capable of true ﬂight. At a local scale, bat ﬂight ability, which may be related to ecomorphological traits, is an important factor inﬂuencing spatial distribution. We tested two postulates: (1) the spatial distribution of bats is affected by sizes of forest gaps created by natural disturbances and (2) species-speciﬁc responses can be predicted from bat ecomorphological traits (aspect ratio (AR) and wingtip shape index (WT)) that inﬂuence bat ﬂight ability. We found that sizes of forest gaps affected the occurrence of each bat species and species richness of bats at local scales; species-speciﬁc responses were related to the ecomorphological traits of individual species. Bat species with high AR and low WT were not affected by variation in canopy gap size. In contrast, bat species with low AR and high WT responded negatively to gap size, and those with intermediate AR and WT responded positively to canopy gap size at sites with small-sized gaps but responded negatively to large-sized gaps. Overall bat species richness responded negatively to gap size. Thus, ecomorphological traits may be important determinants of bat spatial distributions and species diversity at local scales in disturbed habitats. In this study, forest edges might have been undersampled due to the location of bat detectors. However, this potential undersampling should not have affected the interpretation of occurrence patterns of bat species responding to gap size. Our results imply that bat conservation efforts in forest lands should take into consideration speciﬁc responses related to ecomorphological traits of species inhabiting an area. The results also suggest that quantifying the effects of natural disturbances on bat assemblages may provide a knowledge base for forest management to minimize the impacts of unavoidable anthropogenic disturbances on bat species diversity. Rare or infrequent natural disturbances can provide models for forest management aimed at maintaining bat species diversity.",

Further, knowledge of bat ecology in intensively managed forests is fairly limited even though these forests are a substantial portion of the forested landscape in the southeastern U.S. Therefore, we used occupancy models to examine inﬂuence of small-scale vegetation characteristics and large-scale spatial features on foraging patterns of bats within 6 managed-pine (Pinus spp.) forest landscapes in the southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain. We conducted repeated acoustic surveys to determine species presence/non-detection and evaluated a priori models relating detection probability and occupancy to site- and landscape-level metrics for 6 species/genera. Detection of big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) and eastern red (Lasiurus borealis)/Seminole (L. seminolus) bats (eastern red and Seminole bats combined) decreased with increasing basal area, and detection of big brown and Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) increased over the summer sampling period. Relationships between occupancy and habitat metrics were species-speciﬁc but consistent with previous studies. Occupancy for most bat species was lower at sampling sites with higher vegetation clutter and higher basal area. In contrast to most previous studies, occupancy of all bat species investigated was unrelated to or negatively inﬂuenced by distance to water. Although site- and landscape-level features inﬂuenced occupancy, our results indicate that site-speciﬁc features (vegetation clutter and basal area) inﬂuenced most species. Therefore, stand-level management activities that decrease vegetation structure, such as thinning intermediate-aged stands and/or controlling midstory vegetation (e.g., ﬁre or herbicide applications), likely will maintain or increase suitability of managed pine forest stands and landscapes for many bat species in the southeastern Coastal Plain. The forest mosaics that we sampled, consisting primarily of managed pine stands intermingled with non-production habitat types, supported a large proportion of the bat community associated with forests of the Coastal Plain which suggests the compatibility of timber production and bat conservation objectives.",

Although some songbirds respond positively to these management actions to attain desired forest conditions for wildlife, the response of other species, is largely unknown. Nocturnal insects are a primary prey base for bats, thereby inﬂuencing trophic interactions within hardwood forests. To better understand how silviculture inﬂuences insect availability for bats, we conducted vegetation surveys and sampled insect biomass within silviculturally treated bottomland hardwood forest stands. We used passive blacklight traps to capture nocturnal ﬂying insects in 64 treated and 64 untreated reference stands, located on 15 public conservation areas in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Dead wood and silvicultural treatments were positively associated with greater biomass of macro-Lepidoptera, macroColeoptera, and all insect taxa combined. Biomass of micro-Lepidoptera was negatively associated with silvicultural treatment but comprised only a small proportion of total biomass. Understanding the response of nocturnal insects to wildlife-forestry silviculture provides insight for prescribed silvicultural management affecting bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Across the Southeastern U.S., including the Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee, prescribed ﬁre and overstory thinning are being used to restore areas of closed-canopy hardwood forest to open woodland and savanna. We used acoustic recording of bat echolocation call sequences to examine bat activity (relative use of an area for foraging) in hardwood forest stands subject to 4 prescribed ﬁre and residual basal area treatments (spring prescribed ﬁre with woodland [SpW] and savanna [SpS] residual basal areas, and fall prescribed ﬁre with woodland [FaW] and savanna [FaS]) basal areas, as well as untreated controls, during summer of 2013 and 2014. When possible, we classiﬁed recorded echolocation call sequences to species using automated identiﬁcation software (SonobatTM 3.1.4, SonoBatTM Inc., Arcata, California). To minimize errors in species classiﬁcation of recorded bat passes, we combined similar species in groups based on call characteristics prior to conducting analyses. Total bat activity (P 6 0.001), as well as LABO/NYHU (eastern red bat [Lasiurus borealis] and evening bat [Nycticeius humeralis]; P = 0.001), EPFU/LANO (big brown bat [Eptesicus fuscus] and silver-haired bat [Lasionycteris noctivagans]; P 6 0.001), PESU (tricolored bat [Perimyotis subﬂavus]; P = 0.001), and LACI (hoary bat [Lasiurus cinereus]; P = 0.005) activity was generally higher in SpS and FaS stands, where overstory basal area was lower, than in control, SpW, and FaW stands, where overstory basal area was higher (P 6 0.001). Our results suggest these treatments reduce clutter (physical obstructions to ﬂight and foraging including foliage, branches, and stems), leading to improved foraging conditions for bats, particularly larger bodied species with lower call frequencies that are adapted to ﬂy and forage in open conditions. We found no evidence nocturnal ﬂying insect prey abundance or biomass inﬂuenced activity of bats in treatment stands, indicating clutter is more important than prey availability in determining habitat use by bats in this system. Our study provides support for continued use of prescribed ﬁre and overstory thinning to restore hardwood forest to woodland and savanna and as a strategy to maintain and enhance habitat for forest bats in the Southeastern U.S.",

            "abstractNote": "In recent years, large clearings (>1000 ha) accounted for gradually smaller amounts of total annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, whereas the proportion of small clearings (<50 ha) nowadays represents more than 80% of annual deforestation. Despite the ubiquity of small clearings in fragmented Amazonian landscapes, most fragmentation research has focused on the effects of large-scale deforestation, leading to a poor understanding of the impacts of smaller barriers on Amazonian vertebrates. We capitalized on the periodical re-isolation of experimental forest fragments at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in the Central Amazon as a before-after-control-impact experiment to investigate the short-term effects of small clearings on bat assemblages. Over the course of three years we sampled six control sites in continuous forest, the interiors and edges of eight forest fragments as well as eight sites in the surrounding matrix. Sampling took place both before and after the experimental manipulation (clearing of a 100 m wide strip of regrowth around each fragment), resulting in $4000 bat captures. Species were classiﬁed as old-growth specialists and habitat generalists according to their habitat afﬁnities and a joint species distribution modeling framework was used to investigate the effect of fragment re-isolation on species occupancy. Following fragment re-isolation, species richness declined in all habitats other than fragment edges and, although responses were idiosyncratic, this decline was more pronounced for forest specialist than for generalist species. Additionally, fragment re-isolation led to a reduction in the similarity between assemblages in modiﬁed habitats (fragment interiors, edges and matrix) and continuous forest. Sampling of controls in continuous forest both prior to and after reisolation revealed that much of the variation in bat species occupancy between sampling periods did not arise from fragment re-isolation but rather reﬂected natural spatiotemporal variability. This emphasizes the need to sample experimental controls both before and after experimental manipulation and suggests caution in the interpretation of results from studies in which the effects of habitat transformations are assessed based solely on data collected using space-for-time substitution approaches.",

            "abstractNote": "Silvicultural treatments (e.g., selective timber harvests) that are prescribed to promote wildlife habitat are intended to alter the physical structure of forests to achieve conditions deemed beneﬁcial for wildlife. Such treatments have been advocated for management of bottomland hardwood forests on public conservation lands in the Mississippi Alluvial Valley. Although some songbirds respond positively to these management actions, and wildlife-forestry indirectly promotes bat prey availability, bat response is largely unknown. Forest structure may aﬀect bat use of bottomland forests due to diﬀerences in foraging space or roost sites. We examined the eﬀects of silvicultural treatments that were implemented to promote wildlife habitat on bat species activity. We conducted vegetation surveys and sampled insect biomass within 64 treated and 64 reference stands located on 15 public conservation areas in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, USA. We examined the inﬂuence of vegetation metrics and insect biomass on acoustic detections of bats during passive nocturnal surveys in these stands. Detections of bat activity were similar between silviculturally treated stands and reference stands, indicating that both managed and reference stands provide habitat for generalist and forest interior bat species. Generalist bat species (e.g., evening bats, eastern red bats, and Seminole bats) were positively associated with increased insect biomass and the amount of dead wood within a stand. Basal area of large trees was positively associated with detection of tri-colored bats and bottomland specialists (Raﬁnesque’s big-eared bats and myotine bats). Conversely, acoustic detection of bats was negatively associated with increased vegetative density (i.e., clutter). Managers that implement silvicultural treatments to improve desired forest conditions for wildlife can provide habitat for both generalist and forest interior bat species by providing heterogeneous forest structure that includes dead wood, high basal area of large trees, high tree species diversity, and gaps that are suﬃciently thinned to allow unimpeded ﬂight by bats.",

Federal guidelines generally do not require private landowners to search for endangered species before conducting forest management activities. Because private lands make up 85% of Indiana’s forests, recommendations by professional foresters can inﬂuence a large proportion of the management decisions made on Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) habitat in the state. Thus, we wanted to determine what factors lead professional foresters in Indiana to adopt management strategies that beneﬁt bat conservation. We conducted an online survey of Indiana consultant and state foresters to address two main objectives: (1) to assess forester understanding of guidelines for adequate bat habitat, and (2) to identify the factors that inﬂuence professional forester intention to manage forests to improve bat habitat quality. For a subset of survey respondents, we also determined whether forester intent to manage for Indiana bat habitat translated to on-the-ground behavior via an assessment of their stands marked for single-tree selection harvest. We found that most respondents knew some of the forest management guidelines for the Indiana bat, but few were familiar with all guidelines. Through structural equation modeling, we determined that intention to manage forests for the Indiana bat was inﬂuenced most by whether foresters believed following the guidelines would strongly inﬂuence the conservation of the species. We found a diﬀerence in the relative strength (path loading) of this factor between government and consultant foresters. We assessed the management decisions of a subsample of our survey respondents and found that respondent’s decisions aligned with their intention to maintain or create Indiana bat habitat. We suggest two strategies can be employed to improve the habitat management occurring on private lands in Indiana: (1) increasing forester knowledge of federal guidelines and (2) providing evidence to foresters that these guidelines directly contribute to Indiana bat conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "Given the current evidence of global change, extreme events are projected to be more frequent and intense. At a river basin scale, the immediate eﬀects of hurricanes include changes in soil properties, vegetation structure and composition, and water volume and quality, which lead to changes in species distribution and community structure. The goal of this study was to identify key abiotic and biotic elements for monitoring hurricane events at the river basin scale by linking databases of vegetation cover, small mammal diversity and water quality between 2010 and 2016. Abiotic parameters and biotic communities were monitored in a tropical dry forest (TDF) landscape on the coast of Jalisco, Mexico after two major events: Hurricanes Jova (2011) and Patricia (2015). Three zones (1-upper, 2-middle and 3-lower basin) adjacent to the TDF were analyzed along the Cuitzmala River catchment areas before and after the events. We used the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as a proxy for vegetation greenness and the diversity index of a small mammal community of rodents and bats as indicators of terrestrial habitat quality, and Fecal Coliform (FC), Fecal Enterococci (FE), and Electrical Conductivity (EC) as indicators of the river-water condition. During the years of hurricanes (2011 and 2015) there was a decrease in the EVI and small mammal diversity, as well as changes in the concentration of FC, FE and EC. The main eﬀects associated with the two hurricanes were observed in the lower basin where hurricanes made landfall and the forest had been converted to other land uses. The EVI, communities of small mammals, and abiotic and biotic water conditions were responsive to the eﬀects of hurricanes and can thus be useful for a long-term ecological monitoring program at the basin scale. This program would allow a faster evaluation and response to future extreme meteorological events. Our results could be implemented through the Urban and Environmental Plans at the state level (Ordenamiento Territorial del Estado de Jalisco), through the regulation of sustainable agricultural and livestock techniques, and by educating local populations of the eﬀects of extreme meteorological events.",

            "abstractNote": "Wildlife conservation in multi-use landscapes requires identifying and conserving critical resources that may otherwise be destroyed or degraded by human activity. Summer day-roost sites are critical resources for bats, so conserving roost sites is a focus of many bat conservation plans. Studies quantifying day-roost characteristics typically focus on female bats due to their much stronger inﬂuence on reproductive success, but large areas of species’ ranges can be occupied predominantly by male bats due to sexual segregation. We used VHF telemetry to identify and characterize summer day-roost selection by male northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in South Dakota, USA. We tracked 18 bats to 43 tree roosts and used an information-theoretic approach to determine the relative importance of tree- and plot-level characteristics for roost site selection. Bats selected roost trees that were larger in diameter, more decayed, and under denser canopy than other trees available on the landscape. Much like studies of female northern long-eared bats have shown, protecting large-diameter snags within intact forest is important for the conservation of male northern long-eared bats. Unlike female-speciﬁc studies, however, many roosts in our study (39.5%) were located in short (≤3 m) snags. Protecting short snags may be a low-risk, high-reward strategy for conservation of resources important to male northern long-eared bats. Other tree-roosting bat species in ﬁre-prone forests may beneﬁt from forest management practices that promote these tree characteristics, particularly in high-elevation areas where populations largely consist of males.",

Abundance of prey likely has a strong influence on habitat use in forest landscapes as well. Therefore, we simultaneously examined influence of insect abundance and vegetation characteristics on bat site-occupancy across 3 pine (Pinus spp.)-dominated landscapes within the southeastern U. S. Coastal Plain. We conducted acoustic surveys and used Akaike’s Information Criterion to evaluate plausibility of occupancy and detection models that incorporated vegetation- and insect-related factors. Results indicate that bat site-occupancy was better explained by a combination of vegetation characteristics and insect abundance than either separately, and vegetation structure has a stronger influence than prey abundance. Additionally, our data generally suggest insect taxon is more influential in predicting occupancy than insect size. Management activities on pine-dominated landscapes that simultaneously reduce vegetation clutter and increase insect abundance are likely to benefit resident bat species.",

Their natural vegetation, mainly consisting of beech-dominated (Fagus sylvatica) deciduous forests, has been widely replaced by more profitable species grown outside of their natural ranges. This has strongly influenced forest-dwelling commu­ nities. Necessary adaptations to changing climatic conditions and the increasing demand for forest ecosystem multifunctionality are reversing these shifts in tree species composition. Integrative approaches that seek to balance production and conservation goals promote mixed forests of beech with spruce (Picea abies), pine (Pinus sylvestris), or oak (Quercus spp.). These mixed forests more closely resemble the natural vegetation and have reduced vulnerability to disturbances compared to coniferous monocultures, but higher commercial value compared to pure beech forests. However, our understanding of how different levels of admixture of commer­ cially relevant tree species to beech forests affect multi-trophic diversity and community composition remains limited.",

            "abstractNote": "Old-growth forests provide valuable habitats for bat and woodpecker species worldwide. However, the abun­ dance of old-growth related habitat features is frequently reduced in managed forests. Bechstein’s Bat (Myotis bechsteinii, KUHL 1817) is globally restricted to old-growth deciduous forests in Europe and therefore a species of high European conservation priority. Since the species prefers woodpecker cavities for roosting, woodpeckers are keystone species for Bechstein’s Bat. We surveyed woodpecker activity and forest structural features within 16 roost sites of Bechsteińs Bat and a random sample from the surrounding managed forest within the centre of the global distribution of Bechsteińs Bat. We found above-average quantity of old-growth related habitat features in the roost sites of Bechstein’s Bat. Five of six occurring woodpecker species revealed significantly higher densities in the roost sites of Bechstein’s Bat, demonstrating a distinct preference of the woodpeckers and the bat in managed forests for old, deciduous stands with high basal areas of large living trees (DBH > 50 cm), bearing deadwood structures and highest available tree cavity densities. Furthermore, when comparing the direct sur­ roundings of roost trees to their wider surroundings (16 ha), cavity density and other old-growth features reached their maxima in the direct surroundings of roost trees (mean = 19.3 cavities ha− 1), demonstrating a distinct habitat selection of Bechsteińs Bat for patches with maximum available cavity density on large and fine spatial scale. We found a close relation between the basal area of trees with limb break offs (>20 cm base diameter) and tree cavity density, which leads us to the conclusion that specifically injured but still vital, large trees play a major role for the development and long-term persistence of tree cavities. Finally, our analyses revealed a threshold of 20 (DBH > 50 cm) or 10 (DBH > 70 cm) large deciduous trees bearing deadwood structures per ha to fulfil the minimum habitat requirements of the woodpeckers and Bechstein’s Bat. Obviously, Bechsteińs Bat and the associated woodpeckers explicitly selected forest patches, which most closely resembled primeval forest benchmarks, emphasising the importance of maintaining and developing forest patches, providing the mentioned habitat features within managed forests.",

Our research investigated the relationship between insects and forest management practices in the Ozark Na­ tional Forest in Arkansas. We looked at the differences in biomass, abundance, and diversity of insects in 30 treatment stands with varying burn frequencies. Twelve of these stands were burned and mechanically thinned, 12 were only burned, and 6 were untreated. The burn frequencies of these stands range from being burned 0–4 times from 2007 to 2018. We deployed blacklight traps in each of the stands every month from mid-March to mid-November in 2019 to assess nocturnal bat prey. Over 30,070 insects were collected, with Lepidoptera being the most abundant order. Insects were dried, weighed, and identified for diversity metrics. We used multi-model selection and AICc to find the top models from a series of linear mixed effects models to determine the best forest management strategies for bat prey. Total nocturnal, aerial insect biomass, Lepidoptera biomass, and Macro­ heterocera abundance was lower in thinned stands. However, it is unclear if it is the removal of Lepidoptera tree hosts or changes to bat foraging activity that drove this relationship. Stands burned at high frequencies had a higher abundance of Coleoptera. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis was not supported with regards to Lepidoptera diversity and burn frequency. Burning at high frequencies (4 times per 12 years) and not thinning may be the best strategy for maximizing nocturnal Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, respectively.",

            "abstractNote": "Mortality from white-nose syndrome has made management and recovery of the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) a priority. Ensuring availability of diurnal summer roosts, where gestation and rearing of young occurs, is a critical component of successful recovery. However, observed variation in roost selection across the species’ range makes extrapolating data across physiographic regions and habitat types difficult, and limited information exists on roost selection at the southern range extent of the species. Therefore, we examined M. septentrionalis diurnal roost selection toward the southern range extent in northern Georgia, USA. We iden­ tified characteristics of desirable roosts for all individuals and for reproductive females by comparing roosts to surrounding vegetation and topographic characteristics at the plot, home range (67 ha), and landscape (17.2 km2) scales. From May to July 2014–2017, we radio tagged 12 female and 4 male M. septentrionalis and located 37 roosts. Bats roosted in cavities, loose bark, and hollow boles of 16 tree species. Over half of roosts (53%) were located below the canopy and in trees with larger diameters than surrounding trees. Bats disproportionately roosted in snags, with relative probability of selecting a snag roost increasing with snag density at the plot scale. On low gradient slopes, roosts occurred more frequently on west-facing aspects but as slope increased bats showed no aspect preference. Results indicate individuals in our study area are indifferent to or actively avoid roosts with high solar exposure. Our results support previous research that management efforts should focus on creating and retaining snags across the landscape and highlight the need for management to consider regional variation in habitat use.",

            "abstractNote": "Landscape management is a key tool for wildlife conservation. This is especially important in protected areas, where conservation, local resource harvesting such as timber harvesting, and public accessibility are potentially conflicting needs that eventually influence wildlife ecology and behaviour. We studied the spatial behaviour of a forest specialist, the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), and tested how this species copes with: i) habitat structure shaped by forest management practices (past coppice, high forest and conifer plantations), and ii) the occurrence of gaps within the forest matrix opened by people to make space for pastures and hiking trails. We radio-tagged 17 bats for 3 consecutive nights each, to track their movements in a beech-dominated forest landscape in central Italy, and assessed their spatial behaviour in relation to the landscape by adopting two different approaches. First, we applied habitat selection analyses to test whether specific land use classes were disproportionately used by bats over land class availability within the landscape. Second, we related individualbased foraging and commuting locations to landscape structure, predicting activity-specific probabilities in response to land use composition and spatial patterning. Brown long-eared bats most preferred high forest stands, whereas all other land classes were least preferred such as coppice, conifer stands, and pastures. Pre­ dictive models indicate that commuting and foraging, besides being both more likely to occur within high forest, were differently affected by landscape features. Commuting long-eared bats flew along and closer to trails and open areas compared to random sites, while such habitat features were barely used for foraging. On such bases, due to the great importance of high forest, we highlight that long time may be needed to functionally convert coppice into high forest, and that previous forest management may have long-lasting effects on forest-specialist taxa. Similarly, the use of non-native conifers, once favoured for their high timber productivity, should be avoided within protected areas aiming at conserving forest bats. Trails and clearings might also be planned strategically to exploit their potential role of ecological corridor between core forest areas and favour bat commuting.",

            "abstractNote": "Forest ecosystems are fundamental to the conservation of global biodiversity and human wellbeing, hosting high numbers of species worldwide, and providing essential regulatory, provisioning, and cultural ecosystem services. The increasing impact of drivers of environmental changes such as climate change and biological invasions endangers forests, often acting synergically with forest pests, whose effects are exacerbated. Within this context, forest bats may represent key ecosystem service providers by consuming pests such as defoliating and fruitdamaging arthropods, yet their actual role has been so far neglected. Here we pursued the hypothesis that forest bats will be important suppressors of agroforestry pest insects. We analysed the diet of two forest spe­ cialists, Barbastella barbastellus and Plecotus auritus, occurring in syntopy in beech forests of Central Italy, by adopting molecular tools. The diet of the two bat species differed significantly: only 52 out of 71 and 69 prey taxa identified in the diet of B. barbastellus and P. auritus, respectively, were shared between the two bat species. Individual bats preyed, on average, upon 10 insect taxa, and pests were especially frequent in the diet of P. auritus (up to 85% of prey eaten by an individual bat). Such pests included both agricultural and forestdamaging insects, some of which pose serious threats to agroforestry systems. This highlights the importance of preserving animal diversity in forests for the benefit of this ecosystem type as well as of the surrounding habitats, such as farmland.",

We estimated foraging space use and assessed habitat selection for 33 northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) and 25 Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) from May to August 2014–2017 in south-central Indiana, USA. Myotis septentrionalis space use averaged 176 ha and bats selected water, historic thinning, and patch cuts (≤4 ha) over other habitats, with all but one bat avoiding larger openings (≥4-ha clearcuts). Myotis sodalis space use averaged 343 ha and bats selected 4-ha patch cuts, historic openings, and historic thinning over other habitats. In contrast to M. septentrionalis, one-third of the M. sodalis foraged over larger clearcuts, while two-thirds foraged over smaller openings and thinnings. We showed that bats were attracted to small regeneration harvests of varying structural ages. Forests maintained for a mix of mature stands, thinned stands, shelterwoods, small regenerative cuts (<7 ha), and small water sources should provide suitable foraging habitat for these endangered Myotis species, while also promoting forest regeneration.",

            "abstractNote": "Forests provide crucial foraging and roosting habitat to many bat species, and the gradual loss of forests is among the principal threats to global bat diversity. Forests that persist in the face of land use change are those that are managed for a variety of uses, including recreation, hunting, timber production, and wildlife conservation. Thus, understanding how bats respond to management is imperative to their conservation. We used radio telemetry to study the roosting and foraging behaviors of male and female eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis). These forestdependent bats roost in the foliage of live trees and are declining across their range. We tracked 26 bats (7 males and 18 females; one female was tracked twice) from May to August 2017–2019 in two state forests in south-central Indiana, USA. We estimated space use with 95% kernel density estimates and used generalized linear and linear mixed models to assess resource selection and use at three levels: population-level foraging selection, individual-level foraging use, and population-level roost selection. On average, eastern red bats foraged over a relatively small area (81 ha) and traveled a maximum distance of 1404 m from their roosts. The eastern red bat population foraged near maintained openings, recent regeneration openings, roads, and ponds within the study area. Within their foraging ranges, eastern red bats spent more time foraging near roads, ponds, and ridges. Eastern red bats roosted near maintained openings, recent regeneration openings, and ponds, switching roosts every two days. Roost trees were larger than random trees and were in plots containing fewer live stems than random plots. Together, these results reveal that some of the most important landscape features for eastern red bats are linear corridors (e.g., roads or ridgetops), forest openings (e.g., maintained openings and recent regeneration openings), perennial sources of water (e.g., ponds), and large trees. Overall, eastern red bats exhibited strong selection for managed portions of the forest, suggesting they can coexist with and likely benefit from timber management. When considering habitat for eastern red bats in central hardwood forests, we recommend land managers work to maintain large tracts of mature (>90 years old) forest, interspersed with young regeneration openings and provisioned with perennial water sources (e.g., ponds).",

            "abstractNote": "Conifer plantations are a major land use globally and provide a range of social, economic and environmental benefits, particularly the provision of timber. There is a growing interest in alternative forestry techniques, such as irregular silviculture, to create more sustainable and resilient plantations in response to climate change. Plantations are often considered poor for bats due to limited structural diversity. Irregular forestry increases structural diversity and reduces growing stocks, with potentially positive effects on bats, but this remains poorly understood in conifer plantations. At two estates in south-west Britain, we specifically tested whether bat species richness and activity respond to (1) the surrounding landscape cover types (2) habitat structure within irregular stands and (3) increasing progress along the transformation continuum in three continuous cover forestry stands undergoing transformation including irregular high forest. Stands further progressed along the transformation continuum had lower basal area, higher mean tree diameter, higher levels of fallen deadwood and greater canopy cover of broadleaf trees. A total of 13 species of bat, equivalent to 76% of the UK resident species were recorded. The activity of six species was significantly influenced by the proportion of four land use types (two positive and two negative associations with conifer woodland, one positive and one negative association with broadleaved woodland, two positive associations with improved grassland and two negative associations with arable) in the surrounding landscape at three spatial scales (500 m, 1500 m and 3000 m around each survey plot). Four species showed significant positive associations with habitat structural features including larger mean tree diameter, greater canopy openness, higher vertical structural complexity, higher quantities of standing and fallen dead­ wood, and higher canopy cover of broadleaved trees. Many of these habitat features were more prevalent in stands further progressed towards irregular high forest. We did not detect any significant differences in bat species richness or activity levels between the three stand stages, except for Plecotus auritus/austriacus which had higher activity in the Stage 3 stand compared to Stage 2, as the limited replication of our study may have precluded detection of any differences. Our study helps inform us on how bats populations respond to novel management of conifer plantations. Further research to determine thresholds for deadwood and broadleaved trees to further support bats in plantations would be beneficial.",

            "abstractNote": "Resting-site selection involves some of the most important decisions made by organisms. For forest-dwelling bats, where to roost influences not only resting but also many other activities that affect fitness such as raising young, thermoregulation, communication, and evasion of predators. Across much of North America, many bats roost in trees during summer and hibernate in caves during winter and as such, most of the focus on roosting ecology and forest management has been during summer. Along much of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains in the southern portion of North America, winters are relatively warm, few caves exist, and many bat species are active. Herein, we described the tree-roosting ecology of Northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) in Louisiana in both summer and winter, examined roost selection, compared selection seasonally, and compared various aspects of roosting ecology in Louisiana to other areas across North America. We found that in Louisiana M. septentrionalis roosted primarily in pine trees and found no significant differences in roosting characteristics between sexes. Year-round, bats preferred roosts in trees in more advanced stages of decay than available trees. In summer, bats selected for plot level characteristics such as higher density of trees that were large and in more advanced stages of decay. In contrast, in winter, bats selected for tree characteristics such as those with taller, greater diameter and with more exfoliating bark. Comparisons with 21 other studies across North America indicated variation in selected roost characteristics among regions. These results highlight variability in roost selection through space and time and suggest that management strategies that are tailored to specific sites may be most effective for enhancing roosting opportunities of M. septentrionalis and ultimately the conservation of this species.",

Here, we compare the thermal proﬁles of natural tree hollows with three types of artiﬁcial hollows designed for small marsupial gliders and tree-roosting insectivorous bats: (1) ‘chainsaw hollows’ carved directly into the trunks and branches of live trees, (2) ‘log hollows’, and (3) plywood nest boxes. Chainsaw hollows had thermal proﬁles that were similar to natural tree hollows: they were consistently warmer than ambient conditions at night, while remaining cooler than ambient during the day. In contrast, glider and bat boxes had the opposite pattern of heating and cooling, being slightly cooler than ambient at night and substantially hotter during the day. Glider log hollows had greater variation in internal temperatures compared to natural hollows and chainsaw hollows, but ﬂuctuated less than glider boxes. Our results provide the ﬁrst empirical evidence that artiﬁcial hollows carved directly into live trees can produce thermally stable supplementary habitats that could potentially buffer hollow-dependent fauna from weather extremes; whereas, poorly insulated plywood nest boxes produce lower-quality thermal environments. Together these ﬁndings provide positive impetus for stakeholders involved in conservation management and biodiversity offset programs to consider trialing chainsaw hollows in situations where target fauna require well-insulated supplementary habitats.",

            "abstractNote": "Research Highlights: Seasonal variation in environmental conditions coinciding with reproductive and energetic demands might result in seasonal differences in species-speciﬁc habitat use. We studied a winter assemblage of insectivorous bats and found that species acted as habitat generalists during winter compared to expectations based on the summer active season. Background and Objectives: In temperate regions, seasonal ﬂuctuations in resource availability might restructure local bat assemblages. Initially perceived to only hibernate or migrate to avoid adverse winter conditions, temperate insectivorous bats appear to also employ intermediate overwintering strategies, as a growing body of literature suggests that winter activity is quite prevalent and even common in some lower latitude areas. However, to date, most studies have exclusively assessed habitat associations during summer. Because habitat use during summer is strongly inﬂuenced by reproduction, we hypothesized that habitat associations might differ during the non-reproductive winter period. We used acoustic monitoring to assess the habitat associations of bats across a managed pine landscape in the southeastern United States. Materials and Methods: During the winters of 2018 and 2019, we deployed acoustic detectors at 72 unique locations to monitor bat activity and characterized vegetation conditions at two scales (microhabitat and landscape). We used linear mixed models to characterize species-speciﬁc activity patterns associated with different vegetation conditions. Results: We found little evidence of different activity patterns during winter. The activity of three species (hoary bat: Lasiurus cinereus; southeastern myotis: Myotis austroriparius; and tricolored bat: Perimyotis subﬂavus) was not related to vegetation variables and only modest relationships were evident for four other species/groups (big brown bat: Eptesicus fuscus; eastern red bat: L. borealis; Seminole bat: L. seminolus; evening bat: Nycticeius humeralis; and Brazilian free-tailed bat: Tadarida brasiliensis). Conclusions: During winter, the bats in our study were active across the landscape in various cover types, suggesting that they do not exhibit the same habitat associations as in summer. Therefore, seasonal differences in distributions and habitat associations of bat populations need to be considered so that effective management strategies can be devised that help conserve bats year round.",

            "abstractNote": "Reproductively successful and over-wintering populations of the endangered northern longeared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) have recently been discovered on the Coastal Plain of North Carolina. Empirical data on resource selection within the region is limited, likely hindering management of these coastal forests. Our objectives were to determine roosting home range size, selection of day-roost tree species, second- and third-order roosting habitat selection, and to quantify the overall availability of resources in the surrounding landscape. We found core and peripheral roosting home range estimates were large, yet similar to observations from other areas of contiguous forests. Prior to juvenile volancy, female northern long-eared bats appear to select red maple (Acer rubrum), water ash (Fraxinus caroliniana), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) as day-roosts, but then use sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciﬂua), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) after juvenile volancy. At the second-order spatial scale, roosting home ranges were associated with woody wetlands farther from anthropogenic development and open water. However, within the third-order scale, northern long-eared bats were associated with undeveloped woody wetlands and upland forests, areas containing shorter trees and occurring proximal to open water. Peripheral and core areas were predicted to comprise approximately 20% of the local landscape. Our results show that complex and large tracts of woody wetlands juxtaposed with upland forests in this part of the Coastal Plain may be important for northern long-eared bats locally, results largely consistent with species management efforts in eastern North America.",

Roosting in leaf litter by eastern red bats makes them vulnerable to prescribed ﬁres in winter. Using radio telemetry, we tracked 33 male eastern red bats to 101 winter (November–February) roosts and quantiﬁed roost locations, habitat surrounding roosts, and landscape attributes of roost locations. When roosting in trees, bats preferred oaks but generally avoided other tree species; they used pines in proportion to their availability. During colder periods, bats retreated to roosts in leaf litter where 21% suffered mortality either from predation/scavenging or unknown causes while roosting on the ground. Models of roost selection indicated that southerly aspect was the most important factor determining roost selection, and both tree- and leaf-litter roosts were predominately (≥94%) on upper south-facing slopes. Prescribed burning in late morning/early afternoon on clear days when temperatures under leaf litter are warmest in winter could reduce potential mortality by allowing faster arousal time for hibernating bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Fire is a major disturbance for forests and its impacts can be complex, inﬂuenced by a range of factors including ﬁre severity and frequency. Changes to global climate have increased the frequency and lengthened the window for wildﬁres. Anthropogenic ﬁres are now commonly used to try to mitigate the risk and spread of wildﬁres or for ecological purposes, yet it is unclear how many ﬂora and fauna species respond to this lower severity and more patchily distributed treatment. We assessed day-roost selection by a threatened narrow space bat, Nyctophilus corbeni, after a management burn left a mosaic of unburnt forest, low severity (ground scorch) burnt and higher severity (midstorey to crown scorch) burnt forest. Radio-tracking was used to identify day-roosts of 11 individuals (8 lactating females and 3 males) during the maternity season. Characteristics of day-roost trees (n = 42 trees) were similar for males and lactating females and were comparable to other day-roosts used elsewhere in the broader study area, with bats selecting moderately sized (23–24 cm dbhob) dead buloke (Allocasuarina luehmannii) with hollows. However, roost selection at the scale of the neighborhood varied by sex and was random for lactating females. Selection of the post-burn mosaic by males was non-random at all scales of assessment greater than a 100 m neighborhood, with bats selecting areas burnt by low-severity ﬁre at these scales, but avoiding areas of higher severity ﬁre. Locally, there were ~14 more hollow trees per ha surrounding roosts in areas burnt by low severity ﬁre than in the unburnt forest, whereas forest burnt by higher severity ﬁre had on average ~8 fewer hollow trees per hectare. Our study conﬁrmed that dead buloke with hollows is a key resource for N. corbeni that should be prioritized for retention, particularly when identifying areas to offset habitat loss. Patchy management ﬁres appear to be compatible with roosting habits of breeding N. corbeni, provided hollow resources are not impacted by ﬁre. Management burns may promote roosting habitat for male bats, but areas of higher severity burns need to be minimized. Further research is needed to assess the use of the post-burn mosaic for nightly movements, including foraging. The effects of repeated burning on hollow availability and roost selection by N. corbeni should be investigated to identify suitable intervals between ﬁres for this threatened species.",

Efforts to quantify these patterns have included analyses of interpulse intervals, sonar sound groups, and changes in individual signal parameters such as duration or frequency. Here, the similarity in temporal structure between trains of biosonar pulses is assessed. The spike train similarity space (SSIMS) algorithm, originally designed for neural activity pattern analysis, was applied to determine which features of the environment inﬂuence temporal patterning of pulses emitted by ﬂying big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus. In these laboratory experiments, bats ﬂew down a ﬂight corridor through an obstacle array. The corridor varied in width (100, 70, or 40 cm) and shape (straight or curved). Using a relational point-process framework, SSIMS was able to discriminate between echolocation call sequences recorded from ﬂights in each of the corridor widths. SSIMS was also able to tell the difference between pulse trains recorded during ﬂights where corridor shape through the obstacle array matched the previous trials (ﬁxed, or expected) as opposed to those recorded from ﬂights with randomized corridor shape (variable, or unexpected), but only for the ﬂight path shape in which the bats had previous training. The results show that experience inﬂuences the temporal patterns with which bats emit their echolocation calls. It is demonstrated that obstacle proximity to the bat affects call patterns more dramatically than ﬂight path shape.",

            "abstractNote": "Acoustic communication signals are inevitably challenged by ambient noise. In response to noise, many animals adjust their calls to maintain signal detectability. However, the mechanisms by which the auditory system adapts to the adjusted pulses are unclear. Our previous study revealed that the echolocating bat, Hipposideros pratti, increased its pulse intensity in the presence of background white noise. In vivo singleneuron recording demonstrated that the auditory midbrain neurons tuned to the second harmonic (H2 neurons) increased their minimal threshold (MT) to a similar degree as the increment of pulse intensity in the presence of the background noise. Furthermore, the H2 neurons exhibited consistent spike rates at their best amplitudes and sharper intensity tuning with background white noise compared with silent conditions. The previous data indicated that sound intensity analysis by auditory midbrain neurons was adapted to the increased pulse intensity in the same noise condition. This study further examined the echolocation pulse frequency and frequency analysis of auditory midbrain neurons with noise conditions. The data revealed that H. pratti did not shift the resting frequency in the presence of background noise. The auditory midbrain neuronal frequency analysis highly linked to processing the resting frequency with the presence of noise by presenting the constant best frequency (BF), frequency sensitivity, and frequency selectivity. Thus, our results suggested that auditory midbrain neuronal responses in background white noise are adapted to process echolocation pulses in the noise conditions.",

Among the 13 species recognized from continental Africa, systematic relationships remain poorly understood. Taxonomic uncertainty regarding names, suggestions of polytypic species complexes, and undescribed cryptic diversity all contribute to the current confusion. To gain insights into the systematics of this group, we inferred single locus and multi-locus phylogenies and conducted lineage delimitation analyses using seven unlinked genes for specimens from across Africa. Recent collections from Kenya allowed us to carry out population-level analyses for the diverse assemblage of East African Scotophilus. Multi-locus coalescent delimitation methods indicated strong support for three recently named lineages thought to be restricted to Kenya and Tanzania; it also uncovered two new distinctive lineages at present known only from Kenya. Subsequent taxonomic assessments that integrate these genetic data with phenotypic, distributional, and/or ecological traits are needed to establish these lineages as valid species. Nevertheless, as many as 15 Scotophilus species may occur in continental Africa, 10 of these in Kenya alone. Our analysis highlights the importance of population-level surveys for the detection of cryptic diversity in understudied regions such as the Afrotropics.",

            "abstractNote": "Across the globe, millions of hectares of native vegetation have been replaced by commercial plantations, with negative consequences for biodiversity. The effects of the replacement of native vegetation with commercial plantations on the functional and phylogenetic diversity of bat assemblages remain understudied, and most studies have focused exclusively on the taxonomic component of diversity. Here, we investigate how the replacement of natural savannahs by acacia plantations affects the α- and β-diversity of bat assemblages. We sampled bats, using mist-nets at ground level, in natural forest, savannah areas and acacia plantations, in the Lavrados de Roraima in the northern Brazilian Amazon. Our results show that, in general, acacia is less diverse than native forests in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity, and is also less taxonomically diverse than the savannah matrix which it substitutes. The observed patterns of α- and β-diversity found in the present study are in large part driven by the superabundance of one generalist and opportunistic species, Carollia perspicillata, in the acacia plantations. Taken together, our results show that the replacement of areas of natural savannah by acacia plantations causes a regional loss in diversity across all diversity dimensions: taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic. However, further studies are required to fully understand the ecological and conservation implications of this landscape change.",

            "abstractNote": "Social feedback plays an important role in human language development and in the vocal ontogeny of non-human animals. A special form of vocal feedback in humans, infant-directed speech – or motherese – facilitates language learning and is socially beneﬁcial by increasing attention and arousal in the child. It is characterized by high pitch, expanded intonation contours and slower speech tempo. Furthermore, the vocal timbre (i.e., “color” of voice) of motherese differs from the timbre of adult-directed speech. In animals, pup-directed vocalizations are very common, especially in females. But so far there is hardly any research on whether there is a similar phenomenon as motherese in animal vocalizations. The greater sac-winged bat, Saccopteryx bilineata, is a vocal production learner with a large vocal repertoire that is acquired during ontogeny. We compared acoustic features between female pup-directed and adultdirected vocalizations and demonstrated that they differed in timbre and peak frequency. Furthermore, we described pup-directed vocalizations of adult males. During the ontogenetic period when pups’ isolation calls (ICs) (used to solicit maternal care) are converging toward each other to form a group signature, adult males also produce ICs. Pups’ ICs are acoustically more similar to those of males from the same social group than to other males. In conclusion, our novel ﬁndings indicate that parentoffspring communication in bats is more complex and multifaceted than previously thought, with female pup-directed vocalizations reminiscent of human motherese and male pup-directed vocalizations that may facilitate the transmission of a vocal signature across generations.",

            "abstractNote": "Habitat alteration for agriculture can negatively affect wildlife physiology and health by decreasing diet diversity and increasing exposure to agrochemicals for animals foraging in altered landscapes. Such negative effects may be mediated by the disruption of the gut microbiota (termed dysbiosis), yet evidence for associations between habitat alteration, wildlife health, and the gut microbiota remains scarce. We examine the association between management intensity of banana plantations and both the body condition and gut microbiota composition of nectar-feeding bats\n              Glossophaga soricina\n              , which commonly forage within banana plantations across Latin America. We captured and measured 196 bats across conventional monocultures, organic plantations, and natural forests in Costa Rica, and quantified gut microbiome bacterial phylogenetic diversity using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We found that gut microbiota from bats foraging in conventional monocultures were overall less phylogenetically diverse than those from bats foraging in organic plantations or natural forests, both of which were characterized by diverse bacterial assemblages and individualized microbiota. Despite lower diversity, co-occurrence network complexity was higher in conventional monocultures, potentially indicating altered microbial interactions in agricultural landscapes. Bats from both organic and conventional plantations tended to be larger and heavier than their forest counterparts, reflecting the higher food supply. Overall, our study reveals that whilst both conventional monocultures and organic plantations provide a reliable food source for bats, conventional monocultures are associated with less diverse and potentially dysbiotic microbiota, whilst organic plantations promote diverse and individualized gut microbiota akin to their natural forest-foraging counterparts. Whilst the long-term negative effects of anthropogenically-altered microbiota are unclear, our study provides further evidence from a novel perspective that organic agricultural practices are beneficial for wildlife health.",

            "abstractNote": "Optimal migration theory is a framework used to evaluate trade-offs associated with migratory strategies. Two strategies frequently considered by migration theory are time minimizing, whereby migration is completed as quickly as possible, and energy minimizing, whereby migration is completed as energetically efﬁciently as possible. Despite extensive literature dedicated to generating analytical predictions about these migratory strategies, identifying appropriate study systems to empirically test predictions is difﬁcult. Theoretical predictions that compare migratory strategies are qualitative, and empirical tests require that both time-minimizers and energy-minimizers are present in the same population; spring migrating silver-haired (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus) provide such a system. As both species mate in the fall, spring-migrating males are thought to be energy-minimizers while females beneﬁt from early arrival to summering grounds, and are thought to be time-minimizers. Thermoregulatory expression also varies between species during spring migration, as female silver-haired bats and males of both species use torpor while female hoary bats, which implant embryos earlier, are thought to avoid torpor use which would delay pregnancy. Based on optimal migration theory, we predicted that female silverhaired bats and hoary bats would have increased fuel loads relative to males and the difference between fuel loads of male and female hoary bats would be greater than the difference between male and female silver-haired bats. We also predicted that females of both species would have a greater stopover foraging proclivity and/or assimilate nutrients at a greater rate than males. We then empirically tested our predictions using quantitative magnetic resonance to measure fuel load, δ13C isotope breath signature analysis to assess foraging, and 13C–labeled glycine to provide an indicator of nutrient assimilation rate. Optimal migration theory predictions of fuel load were supported, but ﬁeld observations did not support the predicted refueling mechanisms, and alternatively suggested a reliance on increased fuel loads via carry-over effects. This research is the ﬁrst to validate a migration theory prediction in a system of both time and energy minimizers and uses novel methodological approaches to uncover underlying mechanisms of migratory stopover use.",

            "abstractNote": "Despite extensive documentation of the ecological and economic importance of Old World fruit bats (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) and the many threats they face from humans, negative attitudes towards pteropodids have persisted, fuelled by perceptions of bats as being pests and undesirable neighbours. Such long-term negativity towards bats is now further exacerbated by more recent disease-related concerns, particularly associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic. There remains an urgent need to investigate and highlight the positive and beneficial aspects of bats across the Old World. While previous reviews have summarised these extensively, numerous new studies conducted over the last 36 years have provided further valuable data and insights which warrant an updated review. Here we synthesise research on pteropodid-plant interactions, comprising diet, ecological roles, and ecosystem services, conducted during 1985-2020. We uncovered a total of 311 studies covering 75 out of the known 201 pteropodid species (37%), conducted in 47 countries. The majority of studies documented diet (52% of all studies; 67 pteropodid species), followed by foraging movement (49%; 50 pteropodid species), with fewer studies directly investigating the roles played by pteropodids in seed dispersal (24%; 41 pteropodid species), pollination (14%; 19 pteropodid species), and conflict with fruit growers (12%; 11 pteropodid species). Pteropodids were recorded feeding on 1072 plant species from 493 genera and 148 families, with fruits comprising the majority of plant parts consumed, followed by flowers/nectar/pollen, leaves, and other miscellaneous parts. Sixteen pteropodid species have been confirmed to act as pollinators for a total of 21 plant species, and 29 pteropodid species have been confirmed to act as seed dispersers for a total of 311 plant species. Anthropogenic threats disrupting bat-plant interactions in the Old World include hunting, direct persecution, habitat loss/disturbance, invasive species, and climate change, leading to ecosystem-level repercussions. We identify notable research gaps and important research priorities to support conservation action for pteropodids.",

Bat diversity was higher in disturbed habitats (D = 0.84) than undisturbed habitats (D = 0.67). Jackknife 1 species richness estimator suggests 21.53 species for the disturbed forest and 19.30 in the undisturbed forest. Closed-space forager insectivorous bats made up nearly half of the species in the undisturbed forest, but this dropped to 25% in the disturbed forest, meanwhile, edge-space foragers increased in the disturbed forest. Bat community analyses by ordination revealed a distinct bat community composition between the two forest types, demonstrated as a signiﬁcant difference in diversity between the two forest types. The distribution of Rousettus aegyptiacus, Myonycteris angolensis, Hipposideros cf. ruber, and Micropteropus pusillus contribute the most to the difference in bat community composition between the two forest types. Edge and open-space species were likely to beneﬁt from additional resources provided by the disturbed area, by expanding their range and distribution. However, this may not compensate for the decline in the population of forest species caused by the loss of pristine forests, thus measures to conserve montane forest remnants should be of utmost signiﬁcance.",

Differences between males and females lead to a sexual segregation in habitat use. In southern Mexico, we explored sexspeciﬁc responses to landscape modiﬁcation of six common species of phyllostomid bats: Artibeus jamaicensis, A. lituratus, Sturnira lilium, Carollia perspicillata, Glossophaga soricina, and Platyrrhinus helleri using riparian corridors within continuous forest and cattle pastures. Furthermore, we explored sex related responses to vegetation attributes (i.e., tree height and basal area) and seasonality (i.e., wet and dry seasons). Overall, capture rates were signiﬁcantly skewed toward females and riparian corridors in pastures. Females of G. soricina exhibited a strong positive relationship with greater tree height and basal area. Seasonality was important for A. lituratus and S. lilium females, only. The results indicate a sexual driven response of bats to habitat modiﬁcation. The high energetic demands of females associated to reproduction could lead to foraging into riparian corridors in pastures. The presence of large trees along riparian corridors in pastures may help maintaining a diverse and dynamic bat community in modiﬁed tropical landscapes.",

            "abstractNote": "While phyllostomid bats show an impressive range of feeding habits, most of them emit highly similar echolocation calls. Due to the presence of an often prominent noseleaf, it has long been assumed that all phyllostomids emit echolocation calls exclusively through the nostrils rather than through the mouth. However, photo evidence documents also phyllostomid bats ﬂying with an opened mouth. We hypothesized that all phyllostomid species emit echolocation calls only through the nostrils and therefore ﬂy consistently with a closed mouth, and that observations of an open mouth should be a rare and random behavior among individuals and species. Using a high-speed camera and standardized conditions in a ﬂight cage, we screened 40 phyllostomid species. Behavior varied distinctly among the species and mouth posture shows a signiﬁcant phylogenetic signal. Bats of the frugivorous subfamilies Rhinophyllinae and Carolliinae, the nectarivorous subfamilies Glossophaginae and Lonchophyllinae, and the sanguivorous subfamily Desmodontinae all ﬂew consistently with open mouths. So did the animalivorous subfamilies Glyphonycterinae, Micronycterinae and Phyllostominae, with the notable exception of species in the omnivorous genus Phyllostomus, which consistently ﬂew with mouths closed. Bats from the frugivorous subfamily Stenodermatinae also ﬂew exclusively with closed mouths with the single exception of the genus Sturnira, which is the sister clade to all other stenodermatine species. Further, head position angles differed signiﬁcantly between bats echolocating with their mouth closed and those echolocating with their mouths opened, with closedmouth phyllostomids pointing only the nostrils in the direction of ﬂight and open-mouth phyllostomids pointing both the nostrils and mouth gape in the direction of ﬂight. Ancestral trait reconstruction showed that the open mouth mode is the ancestral state within the Phyllostomidae. Based on the observed behavioral differences, we suggest that phyllostomid bats are not all nasal emitters as previously thought and discuss possible reasons. Further experiments, such as selectively obstructing sound emission through nostrils or mouth, respectively, will be necessary to clarify the actual source, plasticity and ecological relevance of sound emission of phyllostomid bats ﬂying with their mouths open.",

            "abstractNote": "Spatial partitioning between neighboring colonies is considered a widespread phenomenon in colonial species, reported mainly in marine birds. Partitioning is suspected to emerge due to various processes, such as competition, diet specialization, memory, information transfer, or even “foraging cultures.” Yet, empirical evidence from other taxa, and studies that tease apart the relative contribution of the processes underlying partitioning, remain scarce, mostly due to insufﬁciently detailed movement data. Here, we used high-resolution movement tracks (at 0.125 Hz) of 107 individuals belonging to two neighboring colonies of the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), a highly gregarious central-place forager, using the ATLAS reverse-GPS system in the Hula Valley, Israel. Based on comparisons between agent-based mechanistic models and observed spatial partitioning patterns, we found high levels of partitioning of both area and tree resources (<11% overlap) that were stable across different fruiting seasons. Importantly, partitioning could not have emerged if the bats’ movement was only limited by food availability and travel distances, as most commonly hypothesized. Rather than density-dependent or between-colony competition, memory, and, to a lesser extent, conformity in tree-use explain how partitioning develops. Elucidating the mechanisms that shape spatial partitioning among neighboring colonies in the wild under variable resource conditions is important for understanding the ecology and evolution of inter-group coexistence, space use patterns and sociality.",

The function of these calls in different species varies and could include eliciting help or acting as a warning signal to stay away. In this study, Cuban fruit-eating bats, Brachyphylla nana, were captured from La Barca Cave in Guanahacabibes National Park, Cuba and distress calls were recorded to examine call structure and variability among different bats. We used Avisoft SASlab pro to analyze 14 different spectral and temporal characteristics of the calls and utilized factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality in the data set and assess variability in call structure. The recorded calls and a pink noise control were used in a playback experiment inside the cave to analyze how bats respond to distress calls. An infrared video camera and ultrasonic microphone were used during the playback to determine if there were any changes in bat behavior, such as an increase in calls observed, bats ﬂying by the speaker, or bats leaving the area. Our results suggest that call structure is variable with limited evidence that call characteristics are unique to speciﬁc individuals. Our playbacks suggest that these calls serve a social function in that the number of bats approaching the speaker increased during distress call playbacks relative to the control. Future work will include building on these results to further explore Brachyphylla nana social behavior including anti-predatory behavior and social communication.",

Social vocalisations are used in a wide variety of contexts and vary greatly in acoustic arrangement and complexity. Among the most intricate are the courtship songs that males of certain species use to attract mates and advertise their qualities. To date, however, few studies have examined the phonological construction of bat songs or made a detailed assessment of the syntax used to combine different song elements. Here, we examine the syntactic construction of courtship songs in the New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat,\n              Mystacina tuberculata\n              , a highly vocal, lek-breeding species with exceptionally high song-output rates. We hypothesised that song construction in this species is both hierarchical and non-random, and demonstrates a high degree of individual variation, potentially allowing for individual recognition. We recorded the courtship songs of nine male bats and used manual classification of song components to examine the song structure. Here we examine whether the deployment of different song components is dependent on their position, and also determine the transition probabilities between different components. We find that the frequency of song-element production and the distribution of elements within songs are non-random at both the individual and population level, and that the number of elements used per phrase differs between individuals. Overall, we demonstrate that\n              M. tuberculata\n              songs are hierarchically constructed and employ phonological syntax to build syllables and phrases. We further show that bats employ high structural similarity and conservatism in the construction of syllables, while retaining a capacity for versatility and innovation that allows for considerable individual variation and, likely, individual recognition.",

Using cytochrome oxidase I amplicon sequence data from Indiana bat guano samples collected at two roosting areas in Cypress Creek National Wildlife Refuge, we found that dipteran taxa (i.e., ﬂies) associated with riparian habitats were the most frequently detected taxon and represented the majority of the sequence diversity among the arthropods sampled. A select few arthropods from other taxa—especially spiders—are also likely important to Indiana bat diets in this refuge. A supervised learning analysis of diet components suggest only a small fraction of the frequently detected taxa are important contributors to spatial and temporal variation. Overall, these data depict the Indiana bat as a generalist consumer whose diet includes some prey items associated with particular seasonal or spatial components, along with other taxa repeatedly consumed throughout the entire foraging season. These molecular diet analyses suggest that protecting foraging resources speciﬁcally associated with the riparian habitat of Cypress Creek National Wildlife Refuge is essential to promote effective Indiana bat conservation.",

However, it is unclear how other community properties influence evenness after integrating the effect of environmental gradients. Using 49 neotropical bat communities, we tested the hypothesis that evenness increases in communities that have low species richness and low biomass because the negative effect of richness and biomass on evenness is regulated by environmental seasonality. We selected among path models to determine how temperature seasonality, the most important gradient across study sites, affected richness and biomass as drivers of evenness. Employing three indices of evenness, we found that more seasonal climate reduces species richness, and lower richness increases evenness. Moreover, a decline in biomass with increasing seasonality also increases evenness. A decrease in resource specialization and rarity as sites become more seasonal may explain the negative relationship between seasonality, richness and evenness. Moreover, the negative effect of biomass on richness and evenness may be due to an expansion of niche space and a positive effect of smaller body size on diversification rates, which may allow more species packing and greater richness. We believe our results bring us closer to a unified theory of which factors control evenness in a community.",

Bats compete for food either through aggression coupled with food-claiming signals or by actively interfering with a competitor’s sensory processing during prey pursuit (i.e., jamming). It is not known why these different behaviors are exhibited. I studied food competition between Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) at foraging sites in Arizona and New Mexico using passive acoustic recording, insect sampling and 3-D infrared videography with or without supplemental lighting that concentrated prey. Bat activity was quantiﬁed by the number of recorded echolocation calls, while feeding behavior was indicated by feeding buzzes. Two competitive behaviors were observed—song, which was produced by bats chasing conspeciﬁcs, and sinFM calls, which jam echolocation of competitors pursuing prey. Song production was most common when few bats were present and feeding at low rates. In contrast, jamming signals were most common with many bats present and feeding at high rates. Supplemental lighting increased the numbers of bats, feeding buzzes and sinFM calls, but not song. These results indicate that bats employ different strategies—singing and chasing competitors at low bat densities but jamming competitors at high bat densities. Food claiming signals (song) may only be effective with few competitors present, whereas jamming can be effective with many bats at a foraging site. Multiple competition strategies appear to have evolved in bats that are used under different densities of competitors.",

The impact of natural vegetation cover, artiﬁcial light intensity and noise (dBA) were investigated on the bat community on the opencast Venetia diamond mine using mixed-effects models. Clutter-feeding bats were virtually absent compared to surrounding natural habitats, suggesting the negative impact of vegetation removal and/or light and/or noise pollution. Mixed-effect models revealed that natural vegetation was the most important factor impacting species richness and overall bat activity. In general, bat activity of both open-air and clutter-edge foragers was negatively impacted over areas close to mining operations that were devoid of vegetation cover. Artiﬁcial light only signiﬁcantly affected feeding activity with less feeding activity in the lit areas. Anthropogenic noise had no signiﬁcant impact on bat activity and species richness. Our study highlights the importance of vegetation cover and the complexity of the interaction between bats and the environment incorporating anthropogenic factors (artiﬁcial lighting, continuous noise, and habitat degradation) and natural factors such as minimum temperature, moon phase, and season that confound trends in bat species richness and responses in relation to opencast mining.",

This leads to significant Linnean and Wallacean shortfalls for bats in the Brazilian-Uruguayan savanna ecoregion. Here, we aimed to model the occupancy of aerial insectivorous bats in response to landscape structure at different scales, considering the influence of microclimate on bat detection. We acoustically monitored 68 locations during the spring and summer of 2019/2020, gathering data on temperature and humidity associated with each acoustic record using data loggers. We detected at least 11 species of the Molossidae and the Vespertilionidae families, of which 9 were used in the model. The response to landscape structure was species-specific: the occupancy probability of\n              Eptesicus brasiliensis\n              and\n              Molossus\n              cf.\n              currentium\n              increased with landscape connectivity at the 500 m scale while\n              Eptesicus furinalis\n              and\n              Histiotus\n              cf.\n              velatus\n              were negatively affected by landscape connectivity at the 5.0 km scale.\n              Molossus\n              occupancy probability responded negatively to landscape heterogeneity at the 3.0 km scale, while\n              Promops centralis\n              responded positively to landscape heterogeneity at the 5.0 km scale.\n              Molossus rufus\n              responded negatively to native vegetation cover and positively to landscape heterogeneity at the 5.0 km scale.\n              Myotis albescens\n              and\n              Molossops temminckii\n              did not respond significantly to any of the evaluated landscape metrics. Our results show that different bat species perceive the landscape differently, regardless of the guild of use of space – edge- or open-space forager. Our estimate of projected occupancy for the areas contiguous to those sampled ranged from 0.45 to 0.70 for the whole of the bat taxa, suggesting that the landscape, particularly where it still maintains its native elements, is reasonably favourable to aerial insectivores.",

            "abstractNote": "Condition-dependent acoustic signals that potentially reveal information about the signaler’s physical or physiological condition are common and important in the animal kingdom. Given the negative effects of parasites on the health and ﬁtness of their hosts, it is reasonable to expect animal acoustic signals to reﬂect detailed information concerning parasite infection. However, despite previous studies having veriﬁed the potential of sexually selected vocalizations to provide information on parasitism based on the correlations between call acoustic properties and parasitism in some animal taxa, less is known about whether acoustic signals used in a non-sexual context also reﬂect parasite infection especially for highly vocal bats. We thus investigated the relationships between the acoustic properties of distress calls and echolocation pulses and the infestation intensity of gamasid mites and bat ﬂies in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) to determine whether acoustic signals potentially contain information about parasite infection. We found that bats infected with more gamasid mites uttered signiﬁcantly shorter echolocation pulses, suggesting that echolocation pulses may contain information on the intensity of mite infection. Additionally, bats infected with more gamasid mites emitted distress calls with narrower bandwidth, while bats with more bat ﬂies emitted calls with longer pause duration. These results suggest that distress calls may not only reﬂect a signaler’s parasite infection intensity but also may provide information concerning infection with speciﬁc parasites. In short, our ﬁndings suggest that acoustic signals of bats potentially reﬂect detailed information about parasite infection.",

While a high biodiversity value of dry grasslands is acknowledged for plants and insects, locally and on landscape level, their relevance for mobile species, such as bats, is unknown. Here we investigate the use of dry grassland fragments by bats in an agriculturally intensified region in Germany and evaluate local and landscape factors influencing bat activity and assemblages. Specifically, we predicted that a combination of local dry grassland structural richness and landscape features as well as their interactions affect bat activity and foraging above dry grasslands. We also expected that these features influence compositions of local bat assemblages. We repeatedly sampled at 12 dry grassland plots with acoustic monitoring and assessed activity and foraging of bat species/sonotypes, which we grouped into guilds known for foraging in open land, at vegetation edges and in narrow spaces. We determined structural richness of the dry grassland plots in field and derived landscape features from digital landscape data. A relatively high proportion of bat species/sonotypes used dry grasslands regularly. The edge space foragers responded positively to higher local structural richness. Their dry grassland use increased when surrounding forests and woody features were less available, but they foraged more on dry grasslands closer to water bodies. Narrow space bat activity on dry grasslands decreased with less landscape connectivity. Open and narrow space foragers responded to local structural richness only in landscape context. For all bat guilds we found increased use of structurally richer dry grasslands when there was more open farmland in the surroundings. This was also the case for edge space foragers, when landscapes were more homogeneous. Lastly, with increasing structural richness, bat assemblages were more dominated by edge space foragers. We show the importance of European dry grassland fragments for the highly mobile group of bats under certain local structural and landscape compositional conditions. Our results underline the value of heterogeneous dry grassland fragments as potential stepping stones in intensively used farmland areas and contribute to evidence based decision making in dry grassland management and bat conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding trophic niche differentiation is critical for exploring interspecific competition and stable coexistence among morphologically similar sympatric species. Bats are an ideal model for studying trophic niche differentiation among species because of their high taxonomic and ecological diversities, as well as their special life history traits. Although many factors can affect bat trophic niches, few studies have combined multiple factors to investigate the influences on bat trophic niches. In this study, we analyzed the summer diet and potential influencing factors of five sympatric rhinolophid bats in southwestern China:\n              Rhinolophus macrotis\n              ,\n              Rhinolophus osgoodi\n              ,\n              Rhinolophus ferrumequinum\n              ,\n              Rhinolophus affinis\n              , and\n              Rhinolophus pusillus\n              . All five species mainly fed on Lepidopteran and Dipteran insects, with a large trophic niche breadth for each species and a low degree of dietary overlap. With the exception of\n              R. affinis\n              and\n              R. pusillus\n              , significant differences in diet composition were detected among species, which indicated relatively low interspecific competition. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that both echolocation calls and body size significantly affected interspecific diet differentiation, while wing morphology and bite force had relatively weak effects. This study suggests that the combined effects of multiple factors may drive trophic niche differentiation among five rhinolophid bat species in the study area.",

Previous studies have focused on the complexity of social calls in some group-living animals, yet the determinants of vocal complexity at the intraspecific level remain unclear. Here, we aimed to assess the influence of group composition on social call complexity in Himalayan leaf-nosed bats (\n              Hipposideros armiger\n              ) in the non-breeding season. The bats divided into three groups with the same number of individuals but with different sex ratio compositions. We monitored social vocalizations for the all-male group, the all-female group, the mixed group, and also quantified vocal complexity for each group based on multiple acoustic metrics, including vocal repertoire, call sequences, the diversity index, and information capacity. The results showed that there were significant differences in the composition of call sequences among the three bat groups. The number of vocalizations was the highest in the mixed group, while the social call complexity was the highest in the all-male group, followed by the all-female group, and was the lowest in the mixed group. The results suggest that sex ratio potentially influence the vocal repertoire in Himalayan leaf-nosed bats. Our findings might provide a cue for vocalization research to investigate sex ratio in social groups as a potential driver for vocal complexity.",

We tested the effectiveness of raising wind‐turbine cut‐in speed – defined as the lowest wind speed at which turbines generate power to the utility system, thereby reducing turbine operation during periods of low wind speeds – to decrease bat mortality at the Casselman Wind Project in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, over a 2‐year period. Observed bat mortality at fully operational turbines was, on average, 5.4 and 3.6 times greater than mortality associated with curtailed (ie non‐operating) turbines in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Relatively small changes to wind‐turbine operation resulted in nightly reductions in bat mortality, ranging from 44% to 93%, with marginal annual power loss (≤ 1% of total annual output). Our findings suggest that increasing turbine cut‐in speeds at wind facilities in areas of conservation concern during times when active bats may be at particular risk from turbines could mitigate this detrimental aspect of wind‐energy generation.",

            "abstractNote": "Introduction: The Eidolon helvum fruit bat is one of the most widely distributed fruit bats in Africa and known to be a reservoir for several pathogenic viruses that can cause disease in animals and humans. To assess the risk of zoonotic spillover, we conducted a serological survey of 304 serum samples from E. helvum bats that were captured for human consumption in Makurdi, Nigeria.\nMethods: Using pseudotyped viruses, we screened 304 serum samples for neutralizing antibodies against viruses from the Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae families.\nResults: We report the presence of neutralizing antibodies against henipavirus lineage GH-M74a virus (odds ratio 6.23; p  <  0.001), Nipah virus (odds ratio 4.04; p  =  0.00031), bat influenza H17N10 virus (odds ratio 7.25; p  <  0.001) and no significant association with Ebola virus (odds ratio 0.56; p  =  0.375) in this bat cohort.\nConclusion: The data suggest a potential risk of zoonotic spillover including the possible circulation of highly pathogenic viruses in E. helvum populations. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining sero-surveillance of E. helvum, and the necessity for further, more comprehensive investigations to monitor changes in virus prevalence, distribution over time, and across different geographic locations.",
