In France, rabies in non-flying terrestrial mammals was declared to be eliminated in 2001, and the risk of rabies is now limited to contact with bats, rabid animals illegally imported from rabies-enzootic countries and traveller exposure in enzootic areas. We analysed the epidemiology of rabies in France from 1995 to 2016, describing and analysing data on human rabies surveillance as well as data on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) collected from the network of French antirabies clinics. Over the study period, seven individuals were diagnosed with rabies in France, all of whom were infected outside mainland France. PEP data analysis revealed an expected overall decrease in PEP administration for individuals exposed in mainland France, but there was still overuse of anti-rabies drugs, given the very low epidemiological risk. On the other hand, a significant increase in PEP delivered to individuals exposed abroad was evidenced. These epidemiological trends indicate that clear guidelines should be provided to support physicians’ efforts to adjust rabies risk assessment to the evolution of the epidemiological situation.",

We conducted a multi-taxa survey to evaluate the potential for biodiversity maintenance in an Atlantic forest landscape that presented a favorable context from a theoretical perspective (high proportion of mature forest partly surrounded by structurally complex matrices). We sampled ferns, butterﬂies, frogs, lizards, bats, small mammals and birds in interiors and edges of large and small mature forest remnants and two matrices (second-growth forests and shade cacao plantations), as well as trees in interiors of small and large remnants. By considering richness, abundance and composition of forest specialists and generalists, we investigated the biodiversity value of matrix habitats (comparing them with interiors of large remnants for all groups except tree), and evaluated area (for all groups) and edge effects (for all groups except trees) in mature forest remnants. Our results suggest that in landscapes comprising high amounts of mature forest and low contrasting matrices: (1) shade cacao plantations and second-growth forests harbor an appreciable number of forest specialists; (2) most forest specialist assemblages are not affected by area or edge effects, while most generalist assemblages proliferate at edges of small remnants. Nevertheless, differences in tree assemblages, especially among smaller trees, suggest that observed patterns are unlikely to be stable over time. Ó 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

            "abstractNote": "Electricity generation from wind energy has proliferated throughout North America and will continue to grow. Given Canada's expected increase in wind energy capacity, consideration of the potential adverse impacts to bird and bat populations is prudent given their sensitivity to these projects. The province of Ontario, Canada is currently the leading jurisdiction for wind energy development, and for provincial guidance on pre- and post-construction monitoring. With uniform monitoring guidance in Ontario, wind energy proponents, and third-party consultants, have developed post-construction monitoring protocols that meet provincial guidance, while also providing standardized reporting. In Atlantic Canada, postconstruction guidelines vary between provinces, depending mostly on guidance from the Environment Canada Canadian Wildlife Service and relevant provincial agencies. To ensure quality post-construction monitoring results in Atlantic Canada and other provinces, it is imperative that all Canadian provinces adopt similar approaches to those employed in Ontario. This paper reviews major causes of bird and bat mortalities; reviews Canadian federal and Ontario provincial bird and bat monitoring guidelines to elucidate gaps between environmental assessment (EA) theory and application; summarizes postconstruction monitoring protocols from eight bird and bat post-construction monitoring programs used in Ontario; and, proposes recommendations to support future wind development opportunities across Canada and speciﬁcally in Atlantic Canada.",

In order to investigate the inﬂuence of these factors, small mammals were surveyed in 36 sites in the landscape of Una, a region that encompasses some of the last and largest Atlantic Forest remnants in northeastern Brazil. Six sites were distributed on each of six landscape components – the interiors and edges of small remnants, the interiors and edges of large remnants, and the most common forested habitats found in the matrix. The survey comprised 46,656 trap-nights and yielded 1725 individuals of 20 species of rodents and marsupials. Results revealed: an increase in beta-diversity caused by fragmentation; the contrasting eﬀects of the altered forested habitats of the matrix, which harbor both forest and disturbance-adapted species; a greater importance of edge eﬀect than of patch size to the observed changes in small mammal community in remnants; an association among terrestrial forest species and among arboreal forest species in terms of the distribution and abundance in the Una mosaic; and a distinctive vulnerability of these two groups of species to fragmentation. Results emphasize the biological importance and conservation value of both fragmented landscapes and small remnants in the Atlantic Forest, as well as the importance of management techniques to control and attenuate edge eﬀects.",

A complete left upper canine was collected at Centinela del Mar (38°21∞S58°W, General Alvarado County, Buenos Aires Province) from fossil-bearing sediments referred to the Late Holocene. The tooth size is 25% larger than that of the modern vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus. We assign this tooth to Desmodus cf. D. draculae, an extinct species recorded in the Pleistocene–Holocene of South America (Brazil and Venezuela). The southernmost distribution of present-day Desmodus extends to northeast Buenos Aires province (35°S). The presence of Desmodus some 600 km south of this present-day limit (July minimal isotherm of 10°C ) indicates that around 300 years BP the southeastern Buenos Aires province was at least 2°C higher than modern July isotherm. The Desmodus tooth is associated with sigmodontine rodents characteristic of subtropical and temperate-warm areas (e. g., Pseudoryzomys simplex, Bibimys cf. B. torresi), and provides additional evidence to support this hypothesis. A correlation with a global warming phase is discussed. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) associated with human to human transmission and severe human infection has been recently reported from the city of Wuhan in China. Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.\nMethods: Putative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was conﬁrmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.\nResults: Our analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Speciﬁcally, in the 5′-part spanning the ﬁrst 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3′-part spanning 24,341–30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat_SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3′-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.\nConclusions: The levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.",

NIBP was measured using oscillometric (NIBP-O) and Doppler (NIBP-D) techniques in the pectoral limb (PEC) and pelvic limbs (PEL) using 3 cuff sizes (1, 2, and 3). NIBP measurements were compared with IBP; systolic (SAP\n                invasive\n                ), mean (MAP\n                invasive\n                ), and diastolic arterial blood pressure (DAP\n                invasive\n                ) during normotension, hypertension, and hypotension. Hypotension was induced with isoflurane (3.8 ± 1.2%) and hypertension with norepinephrine (3 ± 0.5 µg/kg/min). Data analysis included Bland-Altman analyses and 3-way ANOVA. Results were reported as mean bias (95% CI).\n              \n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              \n                NIBP-O monitor reported 29% errors, and experienced more failures with hypertension, cuff placement on PEC, and using a size 1 cuff. Across states, an agreement between NIBP-D and MAP\n                invasive\n                with cuff 2 on PEL (−3 mmHg [−8, 1]), and NIBP-D and SAP\n                invasive\n                with cuff 3 on PEC (2 mmHg [−5, 9 mmHg]) was achieved. NIBP-D over-estimated SAP\n                invasive\n                and MAP\n                invasive\n                during hypertension in both limbs with cuffs 1 and 2. Except during hypotension, NIBP-O underestimated MAP\n                invasive\n                and DAP\n                invasive\n                using a size 2 cuff on PEL.\n              \n            \n            \n              CLINICAL RELEVANCE\n              \n                In anesthetized bats, NIBP-O is unreliable for estimating IBP. NIBP-D shows acceptable agreement with MAP\n                invasive\n                with cuff size 2 on PEL, and with SAP\n                invasive\n                with cuff size 3 on PEC across a wide range of IBP values.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Bats are the natural reservoir host for a range of emerging and re-emerging viruses, including SARS-like coronaviruses, Ebola viruses, henipaviruses and Rabies viruses. However, the mechanisms responsible for the control of viral replication in bats are not understood and there is little information available on any aspect of antiviral immunity in bats. Massively parallel sequencing of the bat transcriptome provides the opportunity for rapid gene discovery. Although the genomes of one megabat and one microbat have now been sequenced to low coverage, no transcriptomic datasets have been reported from any bat species. In this study, we describe the immune transcriptome of the Australian flying fox, Pteropus alecto, providing an important resource for identification of genes involved in a range of activities including antiviral immunity.\nResults: Towards understanding the adaptations that have allowed bats to coexist with viruses, we have de novo assembled transcriptome sequence from immune tissues and stimulated cells from P. alecto. We identified about 18,600 genes involved in a broad range of activities with the most highly expressed genes involved in cell growth and maintenance, enzyme activity, cellular components and metabolism and energy pathways. 3.5% of the bat transcribed genes corresponded to immune genes and a total of about 500 immune genes were identified, providing an overview of both innate and adaptive immunity. A small proportion of transcripts found no match with annotated sequences in any of the public databases and may represent bat-specific transcripts.\nConclusions: This study represents the first reported bat transcriptome dataset and provides a survey of expressed bat genes that complement existing bat genomic data. In addition, these data provide insight into genes relevant to the antiviral responses of bats, and form a basis for examining the roles of these molecules in immune response to viral infection.",

Bat Cave is the type locality for Eschatomoxys pholeter Thomas and Pape (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and an undescribed genus of tineid moth, both of which were discovered during this study. Bat Cave has the most species-rich macro-invertebrate ecology currently known in a cave in the park.",

The most mineralized elements are the humerus and the radius, followed by the metacarpals, of which the third and fifth are the most mineralized. The proximal and middle phalanges of the third digit exhibit the lowest mineral content, and the distal phalanges have no mineral content according to our ashing protocol. Histological examination shows a thin (< 10 μm) shell of unmineralized osteoid surrounding a cartilaginous core in distal phalanges. Mineral content of each bone increases linearly with age during post‐natal development, but there are differences in the rate and extent of this increase among the different elements.\n            \n            The mineralizaton differences we observed parallel substantially different bone loading patterns found in different parts of the wing in other studies. The humerus and radius are subjected to large torsional loads during flight, while the metacarpals and phalanges experience dorsoventral bending. The high mineral content of the humerus and radius and the low mineral content of the metacarpals and phalanges may resist torsion proximally and promote bending distally. Furthermore, the decrease in mineral content along the wing's proximodistal axis decreases bone mass disproportionately at the wing tips, where the energetic cost of accelerating and decelerating limb mass is greatest.",

Much-needed conservation strategies require, among other information, an understanding of their roost movements and population dynamics, which can now be obtained relatively quickly using advanced models. We have studied the long-ﬁngered bat, Myotis capaccinii, an obligate cave-dweller, in Dadia National Park, Greece. The species formed colonies of up to a few thousand individuals and was highly mobile, frequently switching summer roosts up to 39 km apart, even during late pregnancy. The bats migrated to distant hibernacula including a cave in Bulgaria 140 km NW of the Park. Adult recapture probabilities varied with season and sex: low female recapture rates in autumn, relative to spring and summer, indicated non-random temporary emigration following nursery colony dispersal. The opposite pattern was seen in males: increasing recapture rates in the autumn suggest that males gather in these roosts to mate with females in transit. Adult survival (0.86–0.94) was similar in females and males, similar in winter and summer, and comparable to recent estimates for other bats based on similar modelling techniques. Sex-based differences in juvenile recapture suggest female philopatry and male-biased dispersal. Our work shows that protection of M. capaccinii roosts must extend beyond the Park’s and indeed the country’s boundaries: its conservation requires large-scale, trans-national integrated conservation plans. Our results will apply to many other warm-temperate species with similar life history cycles.",

In particular, we are interested in the formation and maintenance of new social structures (roosts) from initial populations as a consequence of both demographic growth and social organization. The example of vampire bats is especially interesting because of the flexible roost-switching behavior shown by these animals in nature. The main hypothesis made in this article concerns the role of grooming networks in roost formation, and was investigated by means of simula tion grounded on ethological evidence. The use of simulation allows the discussion of generative hypotheses on the origin of roosts, which are emergent from individual behavior. Besides confirming the main expectations, the results point to the need for a natural ordering in grooming partner selection. This ordering can be obtained not only through kin-based groups but also through the maintenance of a non kin-based precedence rule.",

It remains one of the least studied bats in Europe. Protection of roosts is fundamental to bat conservation but, for it to be effective, knowledge about roosting ecology is required. We evaluated roosting habits, colony structure, and colony composition of M. capaccinii in the National Park of Dadia–Lefkimi–Souﬂi in Greece during 2002–2004 at 6 underground sites. We report results from regular capture of marked individuals and measures of roost microclimate. Individuals formed large maternity colonies in spring. Parturition began in April and by the end of May all captured females had given birth. The 1st volant young appeared in late June and almost all were weaned by the end of July. Summer colonies were sexually segregated; few males were present in the nursery roosts. Adult females began to disperse in August and the proportion of males increased through September and October. Young born in the year remained in the roosts after the females had left. M. capaccinii selected summer roosts with a wide range of temperatures, tolerating temperatures as low as 11.28C, probably because of the thermoregulatory beneﬁts of aggregating in single- and multispecies clusters. Few individuals remained in these sites during the winter. The majority of females appeared to reach sexual maturity in their 1st autumn and most males did so in their 2nd year. Body mass of males increased steadily from spring through to autumn, whereas mass of females only increased in the autumn before hibernation, except for the additional weight of the fetus during pregnancy, implying that reproduction imposes energetic constraints on females.",

            "abstractNote": "For comparative demography studies, 2 prerequisites are usually needed: 1) using typical parameter values for species, 2) correctly accounting for the uncertainty in the species specific estimates. However, although within‐species variability may be essential, it is typically not considered in analytical procedures, resulting in parameter estimates that may not be representative of the species. Further, data are analysed in 2 steps, first separately for each species, then estimates are compared among species. Accounting for the uncertainty in the species specific estimates is then difficult. Here we propose the application of multilevel Bayesian models on mark—recapture (MR) data for comparative studies on survival probabilities that solves these problems. Our models account for within‐species variability in space and time in the form of random effects. Models reflecting different biological predictions related to the species’ ecology and life‐history traits may further be contrasted. To illustrate our approach, we used long‐term data from 5 temperate tree‐roosting bat species and compared their survival probabilities. Results suggest that species foraging in open space, high reproductive output and short longevity records have lower survival than species foraging at short distances, with low reproductive output and high longevity records. Multilevel models provided relatively precise estimates, away from the edges of the parameter space, even for species with low encounter rates and short study duration. This is particularly valuable for less studied taxa such as bats for which available data are often more sparse. Our approach can be easily extended to include additional groups or levels of interest and effects at the individual level (e.g. sex or age). Different hypotheses regarding differences or similarities in parameters among species can be tested through the application of different models. Overall, it offers a flexible tool to ecologists, and population and evolutionary biologists for comparative studies, explicitly accounting for multilevel structures often encountered in MR data.",

Various skeletal ele ments of the wing are shown to form several groups of mutually correlated characters. The main groups com prise the characters that account for the size of the wing and play a role in the formation of its outer contours. The distribution of characters shows that they describe different aspects of variation and can provide a fairly complete picture of the morphological and ecological structure of the superfamily. The results obtained by means of multidimensional scaling and clustering methods primarily reflect ecological types of bats and only then characterize their taxonomic relationships. Analysis of variation in structural features of the wing within the superfamily Rhinolophoidea shows that the same wing form in different families may be accounted for by different ratios of digit elements, primarily the lengths of distal and proximal phalanges of digits III and IV.",

            "abstractNote": "Surveys on parasites of bats from the Americas have been conducted, but information on helminths is still scarce, especially in the Neotropical region. In Mexico, there are species of bats that lack of a record for helminth species, such as members of the family Noctilionidae. The present study describes for the first time the helminths of Noctilio leporinus in Campeche, Mexico. In 2017, six specimens of N. leporinus were studied for helminths. The species identification of helminths was based on morphological studies and molecular analysis of fragments of the 28S rDNA. All bat specimens were infected for at least one helminth species. Three helminth taxa were identified: the trematode Pygidiopsis macrostomum, and the nematodes Tricholeiperia cf. proencai, and Heli­ gmonellidae gen. sp. The morphological identification of P. macrostomum was confirmed by sequence analysis of 28S rDNA gene. The phylogeny of P. macrostomum grouped our sequence with other sequences of the same species collected in Brazil. The phylogenetic tree of Heligmonellidae gen. sp. indicated that the helminth belongs to clade formed by the species Odilia bainae, Nippostrongylus magnus and Nippostrongylus brasiliensis of the family Heligmonellidae. The phylogenetic analysis of the 28S sequences of T. cf. proencai did not show any similarity or close affinity with nematodes from which that gene has been sequenced to date. The findings of the present study increase the number of helminth species parasitizing bats in Mexico.",

The study was performed on the basis of morphological and functional analysis of anatomical specimens of 15 species, high speed and high definition filming of two species and X-ray survey of Rousettus aegyptiacus flight. Our observations indicate that any excursions of the shoulder girdle in bats have relatively small input in the wing amplitude. Shoulder girdle movements resemble kinematics of a crank mechanism: clavicle plays the role of crank, and scapula—the role of connecting rod. Previously described osseous “locking mechanisms” in shoulder joint of advanced bats do not affect the movements, actually used in flight. The wing beats in bats are performed predominantly by movements of humerus relative to shoulder girdle, although these movements occupy the caudal-most sector of available shoulder mobility.

Sebaceous lipids secreted from host integumentary tissues are implicated in the initial attachment and recognition of host tissues by pathogenic fungi. We are interested in determining if ratios of lipid classes in sebum can be used as biomarkers to diagnose severity of fungal infection in bats. To first establish lipid compositions in bats, we isolated secreted and integral lipid fractions from the hair and wing tissues of three species: big brown bats (\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              ), Eastern red bats (\n              Lasiurus borealis\n              ), and evening bats (\n              Nycticeius humeralis\n              ). Sterols, FFAs, MAGs, and squalene were derivatized as trimethylsilyl esters, separated by gas chromatography, and identified by mass spectrometry. Ratios of sterol to squalene in different tissues were determined, and cholesterol as a disease biomarker was assessed. Free sterol was the dominant lipid class of bat integument. Squalene/sterol ratio is highest in wing sebum. Secreted wing lipid contained higher proportions of saturated FFAs and MAGs than integral wing or secreted hair lipid. These compounds are targets for investigating responses of\n              P. destructans\n              to specific host lipid compounds and as biomarkers to diagnose WNS.",

Bioactive lipid mediators (oxylipins) formed by enzymatic oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids can contribute to these immune responses, but have not been investigated in WNS pathophysiology. Nonenzymatic conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids can also occur due to reactive oxygen species, however, these enantiomeric isomers will lack the same signaling properties. In this study, we performed a series of targeted lipidomic approaches on laboratory Pseudogymnoascus destructans-inoculated bats to assess changes in their splenic lipidome, including the formation of lipid mediators at early stages of WNS. Hepatic lipids previously identified were also resolved to a higher structural detail. We compared WNS-susceptible M. lucifugus to a WNS-resistant species, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). Altered splenic lipid levels were only observed in M. lucifugus. Differences in splenic free fatty acids included both omega-3 and omega-6 compounds. Increased levels of an enantiomeric monohydroxy DHA mixture were found, suggesting nonenzymatic formation. Changes in previously identified hepatic lipids were confined to omega-3 constituents. Together, these results suggest that increased oxidative stress, but not an inflammatory response, is occurring in bats at early stages of WNS that precedes fat depletion. These data have been submitted to metabolomics workbench and assigned a study number ST002304.",

Geomyces pannorum is a related psychrotolerant keratinolytic species that is rarely a pathogen of mammals. In this study, we grew P. destructans and G. pannorum in static liquid cultures at favourable and suboptimal temperatures to: 1) determine if triacylglyceride proﬁles are species-speciﬁc, and 2) determine if there are differences in fatty acyl (FA) saturation levels with respect to temperature. Total lipids isolated from both fungal spp. were separated by thin-layer chromatography and determined to be primarily sterols (w15 %), free fatty acids (FFAs) (w45 %), and triacylglycerides (TAGs) (w50 %), with minor amounts of mono-/diacylglycerides and sterol esters. TAG compositions were proﬁled by matrix-assisted laser desorptioneionization time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MALDIeTOF). Total fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and acyl lipid unsaturation levels were determined by gas chromatographyemass spectrometry (GCeMS). Pseudogymnoascus destructans produced higher proportions of unsaturated 18C fatty acids and TAGs than G. pannorum. Pseudogymnoascus destructans and G. pannorum produced up to a two-fold increase in 18:3 fatty acids at 5  C than at higher temperatures. TAG proportion for P. destructans at upper and lower temperature growth limits was greater than 50 % of total dried mycelia mass. These results indicate fungal spp. alter acyl lipid unsaturation as a strategy to adapt to cold temperatures. Differences between their glycerolipid proﬁles also provide evidence for a different metabolic strategy to support psychrophilic growth, which may inﬂuence P. destructans’ pathogenicity to bats.",

Sebum protects the integument from UV radiation, and maintains host microbial communities among other functions. Native glandular sebum is composed primarily of triacylglycerides (TAG) and wax esters (WE). Upon secretion (mature sebum), these lipids combine with minor cellular membrane components comprising total surface lipids. TAG and WE are further cleaved to smaller molecules through oxidation or host enzymatic digestion, resulting in a complex mixture of glycerolipids (e.g., TAG), sterols, unesterified fatty acids (FFA), WE, cholesteryl esters, and squalene comprising surface lipid. We are interested if fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiling of bat surface lipid could predict species specificity to the cutaneous fungal disease, white nose syndrome (WNS). We collected sebaceous secretions from 13 bat spp. using Sebutape\n              ®\n              and converted them to FAME with an acid catalyzed transesterification. We found that Sebutape\n              ®\n              adhesive patches removed ~6× more total lipid than Sebutape\n              ®\n              indicator strips. Juvenile eastern red bats (\n              Lasiurus borealis\n              ) had significantly higher 18:1 than adults, but 14:0, 16:1, and 20:0 were higher in adults. FAME profiles among several bat species were similar. We concluded that bat surface lipid FAME profiling does not provide a robust model predicting species susceptibility to WNS. However, these results provide baseline data that can be used for lipid roles in future ecological studies, such as life history, diet, or migration.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emergent wildlife fungal disease of cave-dwelling, hibernating bats that has led to unprecedented mortalities throughout North America. A primary factor in WNS-associated bat mortality includes increased arousals from torpor and premature fat depletion during winter months. Details of species and sex-specific changes in lipid metabolism during WNS are poorly understood and may play an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Given the likely role of fat metabolism in WNS and the fact that the liver plays a crucial role in fatty acid distribution and lipid storage, we assessed hepatic lipid signatures of little brown bats (\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              ) and big brown bats (\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              ) at an early stage of infection with the etiological agent,\n              Pseudogymnoascus destructans\n              (Pd). Differences in lipid profiles were detected at the species and sex level in the sham-inoculated treatment, most strikingly in higher hepatic triacylglyceride (TG) levels in\n              E. fuscus\n              females compared to males. Interestingly, several dominant TGs (storage lipids) decreased dramatically after Pd infection in both female\n              M. lucifugus\n              and\n              E. fuscus\n              . Increases in hepatic glycerophospholipid (structural lipid) levels were only observed in\n              M. lucifugus\n              , including two phosphatidylcholines (PC [32:1], PC [42:6]) and one phosphatidylglycerol (PG [34:1]). These results suggest that even at early stages of WNS, changes in hepatic lipid mobilization may occur and be species and sex specific. As pre-hibernation lipid reserves may aid in bat persistence and survival during WNS, these early perturbations to lipid metabolism could have important implications for management responses that aid in pre-hibernation fat storage.",

Data on its distribution in the central and western parts of the continent are largely lacking. For the first time, N. lasiopterus was observed in South Tyrol (Northern Italy) using bat detectors in the summer of 2016 and in the following years until 2021. The five sites where the species was detected are located in a limited area of the Adige Valley, which is characterised by low elevation and a mild climate. Multiple recordings indicated a continuous summer presence of N. lasiopterus on the southern side of the Alps. Additionally, we present insights on echolocation and species identification, including statistically significant differences in the call metrics of N. lasiopterus compared to Tadarida teniotis. These results are important at a European level given that data is lacking on the populations of N. lasiopterus in Europe outside the Mediterranean.",

Neutral lipids extracted from the hair and wing tissue were fractionated by preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) into four major lipid bands corresponding to cholesterol, free fatty acids (FFAs), TAGs, and sterol–wax esters. Densitometry showed higher proportions of TAGs in hair than from wing tissue. TAG bands were recovered and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption–ionization time-offlight mass spectrometry (MALDI–TOF MS). Mass spectra showed sodiated TAG species with variable fatty acyl (FA) moieties range from m/z 715.6–911.8. High intensity ion peaks were consistent with 16:0 and 18:1 as dominant FA moieties, and these were identified as palmitic and oleic acids, respectively, by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. We determined significant differences in TAG profiles between three bat species by MALDI–TOF MS, providing the first description of integumentary lipids in bats. In this study, we performed the first TAG profiling of bats, which suggest such profiles may be species-specific in bats. Key words: bat integument, lipid profiles, matrix assisted laser desorption–ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, thinlayer chromatography, triglycerides, white-nose syndrome, eastern red bat, Lasiurus borealis.",

Previous phylogenetic studies based on the envelope protein indicated that there are four genotypes, and surveillance data suggest that genotype I is gradually replacing genotype III as the dominant strain. Here we report an evolutionary analysis based on 98 full-length genome sequences of JEV, including 67 new samples isolated from humans, pigs, mosquitoes, midges. and bats in affected areas. To investigate the relationships between the genotypes and the significance of genotype I in recent epidemics, we estimated evolutionary rates, ages of common ancestors, and population demographics. Our results indicate that the genotypes diverged in the order IV, III, II, and I and that the genetic diversity of genotype III has decreased rapidly while that of genotype I has increased gradually, consistent with its emergence as the dominant genotype.",

Here, we utilize comparative genomics to examine the evolutionary history of this pathogen in comparison to six closely related nonpathogenic species.\n              P. destructans\n              displays a large reduction in carbohydrate-utilizing enzymes (CAZymes) and in the predicted secretome (~50%), and an increase in lineage-specific genes. The pathogen has lost a key enzyme, UVE1, in the alternate excision repair (AER) pathway, which is known to contribute to repair of DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet (UV) light. Consistent with a nonfunctional AER pathway,\n              P. destructans\n              is extremely sensitive to UV light, as well as the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The differential susceptibility of\n              P. destructans\n              to UV light in comparison to other hibernacula-inhabiting fungi represents a potential “Achilles’ heel” of\n              P. destructans\n              that might be exploited for treatment of bats with WNS.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract The poorly studied bat fauna of the Fiji Islands is of notable conservation importance because it includes one endemic species, several near endemics, and the best global populations of several threatened species. In addition, some of the species play a keystone role as pollinators and seed dispersers in valuable forest ecosystems. We visited 30 islands of the archipelago to survey bats and assess their conservation status and the potential threats to their continued existence. The Vulnerable Notopteris macdonaldi occurs on the three main islands but may only have nurseries on one of them. The Critically Endangered, endemic Mirimiri acrodonta appears to be restricted to a small montane area on a single island. Pteropus tonganus is consumed throughout rural Fiji but remains common and is not currently threatened by the harvest. The Near Threatened Pteropus samoensis is locally common on the largest islands but threatened on some smaller islands. The Endangered Chaerephon bregullae exists only on two islands and appears to concentrate in a single large colony to nurse young. The Endangered Emballonura semicaudata has declined dramatically in Fiji, as across most of its range, although a few substantial populations remain on some small islands. Factors threatening these species are variable but include small ranges, concentration in a reduced number of colonies, deforestation, over-harvesting, and introduced predators. We propose conservation measures and indicate a number of priority sites.",

Mutualisms and commensalisms appear to be widespread in the animal kingdom, with examples of mammals, birds, fish, and reptiles from around the world engaging with other species in evidentially beneficial ways. Cleaning mutualism is a specific type positive inter-species interaction in which one species removes and feeds upon parasites infesting the other. Here, we document a new subset of positive inter-species “cleaning” interactions, in which one partner benefits from and reduces the abundance of pest species attracted by but not attached to their host. We observed in person and in camera trap footage numerous instances of insectivorous bats associating with white‐tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and feeding on the swarms of biting flies attracted to these large mammals. We call for the increased reporting of positive inter-species associations to better our understanding of the mechanisms leading to the formation of these interactions and the effects that these relationships may for the structuring of ecological communities.",

Both intra- and inter-observer errors significantly contributed to the total variance of some characters. Intra-observer variability was responsible for :s 17% of the total variance (median = 10%) whereas interobserver variability reached 30.7% (median = 3.9%). Characters with high intra-observer variability were those that exhibited high inter-observer variability. In comparisons involving measurements taken by different observers, a considerable risk exists that statistically significant results may arise due to measuring artifacts alone, especially when using large samples. However, measurements taken by different observers can be used in a single analysis if potentially risky characters are excluded from consideration. These include characters with high intra-observer variability, small means, or morphologically unclear endpoints.",

The lack of knowledge on bat's responses to the anthropogenic effects as related to their bat flies leads to ineffective conservation strategies. Thus, our goal is to describe the association between bats and bat flies in urban and non-urban environments and measuring how much urbanization can alter the parasite-host associations. We collected bats and bat flies in 11 sites (six urban areas and five non-urban areas) distributed among five municipalities of the state of Pará. To identify a possible pattern on communities, we conducted a Composition Principal Component Analysis and performed a permutational multivariate analysis of variance using distance matrices — PERMANOVA. We captured 513 bats and examined 867 bat flies. Our findings show that bat and bat fly communities of rural environments in the Amazon are more diverse than those from urban environments. Urbanization seems to play an essential role as an environmental filter of bats and bat fly species that are exclusively rural.",

We confirm here its presence in the department of Chocó after the analysis of specimen CMCH 1285 ♂ collected in the village of Pacurita, Municipality of Quibdó, and deposited in the Chocó Theriological Collection. We also comment on the differences among Eptesicus species present in the department of Chocó based on external characters and we include an updated map of its distribution in the country.",

The mobility of the pursuer and the target in a three dimensional environment during predation makes the capture task highly complex. Many researchers have studied and analyzed prey capture dynamics in diﬀerent aerial species such as insects and bats. This article focuses on reviewing the capture strategies adopted by these species while relying on diﬀerent sensory variables (vision and acoustics) for navigation. In conclusion, the neural basis of these capture strategies and some applications of these strategies in bio-inspired navigation and control of engineered systems are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Animals’ mortality due to transportation infrastructure is a significant problem for some species. Scale of mortality in part depends on their behavior near railways and other transport routes. We studied the mortality and flight activity of bats in 7 double-track electrified (i.e., leading the catenary, a railway overhead electric line) railway sites in Poland. We aimed to measure the likelihood that bats use areas which pose a potential risk of collision with trains. During acoustic (ultrasound detectors) and visual (thermal imaging cameras) observations, we identified bats’ positions near the railway (A — high above catenary; B — close (< 1 m) but not under catenary; C — the space destined for passing trains between tracks, traction poles, and the top of the catenary; D — at the side of the railway and next to vegetation without crossing the railway area; and E — under bridges) in different habitats (forest, water, open, urbanized). Bat activity was significantly lower (4%) in high-risk impact zone (C) than that in other zones (96%). However, bats were more prone to occur in high-risk impact zones in urbanized and open habitats, whereas, in water and forest habitats, bats occurred much less frequently. In forest sections of the railways, flights along the railway typically took place between the line and vegetation (zone D), or close to the catenary (zone B). We detected significant differences between species activity in and outside the high-impact zone (C) and other zones (A, B, D, E). Open-spaced and high-flying common noctule Nyctalus noctula usually flew or foraged above the railway area. Daubenton’s bat Myotis daubentonii almost exclusively sought food above lakes or rivers and under the railway bridges. In serotines Eptesicus and pipistrelles Pipistrellus group, there was a higher tendency to use a high-risk impact zone. The search for bat casualties conducted by the researchers and a trained dog revealed one dead bat under the 50-m overpass of the two-track railway immediately following the simultaneous passage of two trains. We assumed that there is a lower chance of bat collisions with trains than with cars because of the low level of nighttime traffic on railways, when bats are active, and the specific arrangement of electrified railways. Such railways provide bats with additional open space between tracks with electrification system and the forest edge, or above the catenary for foraging and commuting. Bats utilize this space and avoid flying in the area over the track that is cluttered by the catenary; this may reduce their exposure to passing trains and the likelihood of collisions.",

We investigated the seasonal population dynamics and use of the cave system by bats, carrying out 15 surveys before (2002–2003) and 38 surveys after (2004–2008) the cave system was opened to tourism. We recorded 15 species of bats; the highest numbers recorded in a single survey were 54,600 hibernating and 11,000 breeding/nursing. Diﬀerent parts of the cave system are used by bats to various degrees according to season. To protect the bats and the cave system the visitor schedule took into consideration the diﬀerences in seasonal use of the caves by bats. There was a signiﬁcant increase in the total number of bats recorded in the cave system after opening for tourism, possibly because the gating of two entrances helped to control visitation. The results of our surveys of this cave system show that gating of entrances and visits by tourists are not necessarily incompatible with the use of caves by bats for both hibernating and nursing. Understanding how the three caves are used seasonally by the bat community, and for what purposes (hibernation vs nursing), was critical for the establishment of an appropriate management plan for tourism.",

Ten apparently healthy animals (five males and five females) were used to determine the hematology and plasma biochemistry parameters including, leucocyte (white blood cell) counts (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), albumin (ALB), total protein (TP), cholesterol (CHO), glucose (GLU), triglycerides (TG), Urea (U), creatine (CREAT), alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST). No statistically significant differences were found between male and female animals for the analyzed parameters. Plasma total cholesterol concentration was similar with the those of other insectivorous bat species whereas extremely higher than frugivorous species. Also, triglyceride level was higher than the frugivorous bats. The high total cholesterol and triglyceride values in M. myotis reflect a protein-rich diet of insectivorous bat species. The values recorded in this study could be helpful in evaluating the physiologic and pathologic status of M. myotis in the wild for conservation and management of species.",

The total number of species found there was 11. Five species of the Dupnisa Cave bat population constitute 99% of the fauna: M. schreibersii (78.0%), M. myotis/blythii (7.9%), R. euryale (6.9%), R. ferrumequinum (4.5%) and M. capaccinii (1.8%). During the winter months (November-March) the maximum number of bats recorded there amount to over 54 000, although in summer (April-October) the total was over 10 000 individuals. The different parts of the cave system are used differently according to the season (winter or summer): Sulu Cave is used almost solely by hibernating bats (70.6% vs 0.1%), Kuru Cave is used as a nursery (0.2% vs 10.6%), while Kýz Cave is used both for hibernation and as a nursery (13.5% vs 5.0%). We found correlations between the species composition and the temperature recorded during the investigated season in particular parts of the system, although no influence of humidity was observed on M.myotis/blythii, M. capaccinii, R. ferrumequinum and M. schreibersii. Sulu Cave (the coldest in summer and in winter) is a hibernaculum, but Kuru Cave is used for breeding purposes as well as for hibernation by R. mehelyi and R. euryale. The Dupnisa Cave System is the most important shelter in theThrace region of Turkey.",

For this purpose, 10 specimens of oesophagus were collected and processed. The oesophagus wall of M. myotis is composed of four layers: tunica mucosa, tunica submucosa, tunica muscularis and tunica adventitia. The mucosa is covered by a non-­keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. There were no glands in the wall of the oesophagus. Tunica muscularis is composed of two muscle layers: internal circular muscular layer and an external longitudinal muscular layer. Histochemical studies revealed that the oesophagus was AB/PAS and PAS positive indicating the presence of acidic and neutral mucosubstances. AB-­PAS staining shows that glycoproteins were predominant in the all examined layers of the oesophagus. Because of the absence of oesophageal glands in M. myotis, positive reaction with AB-­PAS staining may be due to secretion of salivary glands. Absence of oesophageal glands reflects the functional adaptation as high food passage rate for the insectivorous feeding habits of animals.",

            "abstractNote": "We examined the histological structure of the kidneys of Myotis myotis to better understand their structural adaptations to dietary habits. M. myotis is an insectivorous bat species that belongs to the family Vespertilionidae. The kidneys of M. myotis are unilobular, bean-shaped, and surrounded by a renal capsule. The two parts are distinguished by a thin cortex and a thicker medulla. Renal corpuscles consist of the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule. The proximal tubule consists of cubic cells with a well-developed brush border, whereas the distal tubule is lined with a simple cubic epithelium without a brush border. The Henle's loop, located in the medullary region, was composed of flat cells. The microvilli of proximal tubule epithelial cells and basal lamina of proximal and distal tubule epithelial cells were periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive. The PAS-positive reaction of the microvilli of proximal tubular epithelial cells and basal lamina of proximal and distal tubule epithelial cells is due to the presence of glycogen, which may be used as an energy substrate during absorption. The presence of acidic glycoconjugates in the papilla was demonstrated by Alcian blue (pH 2.5)-PAS staining. According to the result of silver impregnation staining, it was determined that reticular fibers form a dense fibrillary network in the kidney parenchymal tissue. Reticular fibers are responsible for demarcating and supporting the borders of cells by forming a thin network of fibrils beneath the basal lamina of the cells. Structural features in the kidney, such as a thin cortex and thicker medulla, long conical papilla, and division of the thick medulla into inner and outer regions, of M. myotis may be an adaptation to produce concentrated urine, thereby reducing water loss associated with insectivorous feeding habits.",

The results of morphometric analyses indicated that hibernation affected the villus height, villus width, crypt depth and crypt width of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Histochemical analysis showed that goblet cells of the small and large intestine contain acidic and neutral mucosubstances. According to the results obtained with Alcian Blue (pH 5.8)/PAS staining, hyaluronic acid is dominant in the goblet cells of the small and large intestine during both the hibernation and active periods. Chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, which are sulfated GAGs, were dominant, and very little heparan sulfate, heparin and keratan sulfate were present. Moreover, sulfated glycoproteins were also detected in the goblet cells of the small intestine in the active animals. The present study demonstrates that hibernation altered the examined morphometric and histochemical parameters of the intestine.",

Allen, 1891)) by visual analysis of bat feces and stable carbon (d13C) and nitrogen (d15N) isotope analysis of bat feces, wing, hair, and insect prey. We collected 33 fecal samples from spotted bats and trapped 3755 insects where bats foraged. Lepidopterans averaged 99.6% of feces by volume; other insects were not a major component of diet. The d13C and d15N values of bat feces were similar to those of moths from families Noctuidae (N), Lasiocampidae (L), and Geometridae (G), but differed from Arctiidae (A) and Sphingidae (S). We used a mixing model to reconstruct diet; three families (N, L, G) represented the majority (88%–100%) of the diet with A + S representing 0%–12%. Although we compared d13C and d15N values of wing, hair, and feces of spotted bats, feces best represented recent diet; wing and hair were more enriched than feces by 3% and 6%, respectively. This pattern was consistent with that reported for other bat species. We suggest that spotted bats persist across a wide latitudinal gradient partly because they can forage on a variety of noctuid, geometrid, and lasiocampid moths. Using visual fecal inspection with stable isotope analysis provided information on families of moths consumed by an uncommon bat species. Re´sume´ : Nous avons e´value´ le re´gime alimentaire de chauves-souris tachete´es (Euderma maculatum (J.A. Allen, 1891)) par analyse visuelle des fe`ces des chauves-souris et par de´termination des isotopes stables de carbone (d13C) et d’azote (d15N) des fe`ces, des ailes, des poils et des insectes proies des chauves-souris. Nous avons re´colte´ 33 e´chantillons de fe`ces de chauves-souris tachete´es et pie´ge´ 3755 insectes la` ou` les chauves-souris se nourrissent. En moyenne, les le´pidopte`res repre´sentent 99,6 % du volume des fe`ces; les autres insectes ne constituent pas une composante importante du re´gime. Les valeurs de d13C et de d15N des fe`ces de chauves-souris sont semblables a` celles des papillons de nuit des familles Noctuidae (N), Lasiocampidae (L) et Geometridae (G), mais diffe´rent de celles des Arctiidae (A) et des Sphingidae (S). Un mode`le de me´lange a servi a` reconstituer le re´gime alimentaire; trois familles (N, L, G) repre´sentent la majeure partie du re´gime (88 % a` 100 %), alors qu’A + S constituent 0 % a` 12 %. Nous avons compare´ les d13C et d15N de l’aile, du poil et des fe`ces des chauves-souris tachete´es, mais les fe`ces repre´sentent le mieux le re´gime re´cent; l’aile et le poil sont plus enrichis que les fe`ces respectivement de 3 % et de 6 %. Ce patron concorde avec celui signale´ chez les autres espe`ces de chauves-souris. Nous croyons que les chauves-souris tachete´es survivent sur un important gradient latitudinal en partie parce qu’elles peuvent se nourrir d’une varie´te´ de papillons de nuit noctuide´s, ge´ome´tride´s et lasiocampide´s. L’inspection visuelle des fe`ces combine´e a` une analyse des isotopes stables a ainsi fourni des renseignements sur les familles de papillons de nuit consomme´es par une espe`ce peu commune de chauves-souris.",

These proxies are reputedly easier and cheaper to assess than biodiversity. Tree microhabitats—tree‐borne singularities such as cavities, conks of fungi or bark characteristics—have gained attention as potential forest biodiversity indicators. However, as with most biodiversity indicators, there is a lack of scientific evidence documenting their quantitative link with the biodiversity they are supposed to assess.\n                \n                \n                  We explored the link between microhabitat indices and the richness and abundance of three taxonomic groups: bats, birds and saproxylic beetles. Using a nation‐wide multi‐taxon sampling design in France, we compared 213 plots located inside and outside strict forest reserves. We hypothesized that the positive effect setting aside forest reserves has on biodiversity conservation is indirectly due to an increase in the proportion of large structural elements (e.g., living trees, standing and lying deadwood). These, in turn, are likely to favour the quantity and diversity of microhabitats. We analysed the relationship between the abundance and species richness of different groups and guilds (e.g., red‐listed species, forest specialists, cavity dwellers) and microhabitat density and diversity. We then used confirmatory structural equation models to assess the direct and indirect effects of management abandonment, large structural elements and microhabitats on the biodiversity of the target species.\n                \n                \n                  For several groups of birds and bats, the indirect effect of management abandonment and large structural elements on biodiversity was mediated by microhabitats. However, the magnitude of the link between microhabitat indices and biodiversity was moderate. In particular, saproxylic beetles’ biodiversity was poorly explained by microhabitats, large structural elements or management abandonment.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Tree microhabitats may serve as indicators for bats and birds, but they are not a universal biodiversity indicator. Rather, compared to large structural elements, they most likely have a complementary role to biodiversity. In terms of forest management and conservation, preserving diversity of microhabitats at the local scale benefits several groups of both bats and birds.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Tree microhabitats may serve as indicators for bats and birds, but they are not a universal biodiversity indicator.

Eight field campaigns (including trapping for small mammals and mist-netting for bats) were conducted between May 2002 and July 2004. Forty-six mammals belonging to eight orders were recorded. Fifteen species not recorded in previous inventories at the Station were identified; on the other hand, 14 mammals listed in previous studies were not recorded now. The most abundant small mammals at the EPDAPeti were Oligorizomys flavescens, Akodon cursor, Trinomys setosus and Bolomys lasiurus. The small mammal community from the campo rupestre (high altitude, rocky grassland) habitat is distinct from that found in the forest. In spite of the reserve’s small size, mammal species’ richness is relatively high. Possible reasons for this are the diversity of habitats and the fact that EPDA-Peti is located in a transitional zone between the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado.",

Less conspicuous but equally fascinating are the sensory and cognitive adaptations that determine animals’ interactions with their environments and each other. We discuss the development of the fields of sensory and cognitive ecology and the importance of integrating these fields to understand the evolution of adaptive behaviors. Bats, with their extraordinarily high ecological diversity, are ideal animals for this purpose. An explosion in recent research allows for better understanding of the molecular, genetic, neural, and behavioral bases for sensory ecology and cognition in bats. We give examples of studies that illuminate connections between sensory and cognitive features of information filtering, evolutionary trade-offs in sensory and cognitive processing, and multimodal sensing and integration. By investigating the selective pressures underlying information acquisition, processing, and use in bats, we aim to illuminate patterns and processes driving sensory and cognitive evolution.",

Previous experiments show that wild T. cirrhosus brought into the laboratory are ﬂexible in their ability to reverse the associations they form between prey cues and prey quality [2]. Here we asked how this ﬂexibility can be achieved in nature. We quantiﬁed the rate at which bats learned to associate the calls of a poisonous toad species with palatable prey by placing bats in three groups: (a) social learning, in which a bat inexperienced with the novel association was allowed to observe an experienced bat; (b) social facilitation, in which two inexperienced bats were presented with the experimental task together; and (c) trial-and-error, in which a single inexperienced bat was presented with the experimental task alone. In the social-learning group, bats rapidly acquired the novel association in an average of 5.3 trials. In the social-facilitation and trial-and-error groups, most bats did not approach the call of the poisonous species after 100 trials. Thus, once acquired, novel associations between prey cue and prey quality could spread rapidly through the bat population by cultural transmission. This is the ﬁrst case to document predator social learning of an acoustic prey cue.",

Examinations of the sensory strategies implemented by predators to detect their prey, as well as the ecological consequences of these interactions, are at the crux of understanding and predicting predator–prey dynamics.\n                \n                \n                  We review the sensory strategies used by predators that rely on private information (attending directly to cues and signals generated by their prey) and those that gather social information (attending to the signals and behaviours of others). We focus our enquiry on bats, an ideal group to shed light on these questions given their ecological diversity, varied foraging strategies and wide range of social behaviours.\n                \n                \n                  We discuss the costs and benefits of using private and social information for foraging.

            "abstractNote": "Bats provide important ecosystem services such as pollination of native forests; they are also a source of zoonotic pathogens for humans and domestic animals. Human-induced changes to native habitats may have created more opportunities for bats to reside in urban settings, thus decreasing pollination services to native forests and increasing opportunities for zoonotic transmission. In Australia, fruit bats (\n              Pteropus\n              spp. flying foxes) are increasingly inhabiting urban areas where they feed on anthropogenic food sources with nutritional characteristics and phenology that differ from native habitats. We use optimal foraging theory to investigate the relationship between bat residence time in a patch, the time it takes to search for a new patch (simulating loss of native habitat) and seasonal resource production. We show that it can be beneficial to reside in a patch, even when food productivity is low, as long as foraging intensity is low and the expected searching time is high. A small increase in the expected patch searching time greatly increases the residence time, suggesting nonlinear associations between patch residence and loss of seasonal native resources. We also found that sudden increases in resource consumption due to an influx of new bats has complex effects on patch departure times that again depend on expected searching times and seasonality. Our results suggest that the increased use of urban landscapes by bats may be a response to new spatial and temporal configurations of foraging opportunities. Given that bats are reservoir hosts of zoonotic diseases, our results provide a framework to study the effects of foraging ecology on disease dynamics.\n            \n            One contribution of 14 to a theme isssue ‘Anthropogenic resource subsidies and host–parasite dynamics in wildlife’.",

            "abstractNote": "The repetitive landscapes of mammalian genomes typically display high Class I (retrotransposon) transposable element (TE) content, which usually comprises around half of the genome. In contrast, the Class II (DNA transposon) contribution is typically small (,3% in model mammals). Most mammalian genomes exhibit a precipitous decline in Class II activity beginning roughly 40 Ma. The ﬁrst signs of more recently active mammalian Class II TEs were obtained from the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, and are reﬂected by higher genome content (;5%). To aid in determining taxonomic limits and potential impacts of this elevated Class II activity, we performed 454 survey sequencing of a second Myotis species as well as four additional taxa within the family Vespertilionidae and an outgroup species from Phyllostomidae. Graph-based clustering methods were used to reconstruct the major repeat families present in each species and novel elements were identiﬁed in several taxa. Retrotransposons remained the dominant group with regard to overall genome mass. Elevated Class II TE composition (3–4%) was observed in all ﬁve vesper bats, while less than 0.5% of the phyllostomid reads were identiﬁed as Class II derived. Differences in satellite DNA and Class I TE content are also described among vespertilionid taxa. These analyses present the ﬁrst cohesive description of TE evolution across closely related mammalian species, revealing genomescale differences in TE content within a single family.",

To determine the genetic and reservoir-associated diversity cDNA fragments encoding 88 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the nucleoprotein were sequenced and used in phylogenetic analyses. Eight genetic lineages (GL) were characterized. GL1, GL2 and GL3 consisted of dog-associated antigenic variant (AV) 1 RABV, isolated in the centre-east, north and southwest of Colombia, respectively. GL1 is apparently extinct in Colombia. The GL4 were AV3, AV8 and non-determined (ND) AV viruses associated with hematophagous bats. The GL5 and GL6 consisted of AV4 viruses. GL6 isolate was found associated with Tadarida brasiliensis bats. GL5 segregated independently. The GL7 and GL8 segregated independently within clades associated with colonial insectivorous and solitary bats, respectively. Both of these were represented by NDAV viruses. Viruses isolated from humans grouped within GL2, GL3 and GL4, which in turn corresponded to AV1, 3, 8 and ND. Dogs and D. rotundus are the two major rabies reservoirs and vectors in Colombia. Insectivorous bats may also be important rabies reservoirs but spillovers to other species are rare. Our data were consistent with previous studies in which partial Psi, G and L gene sequences were analyzed. Our results conﬁrmed the existence of RABV of unclassiﬁed AV in Colombia.",

In order to derive phylogenetic relationships between rabies viruses isolated in foxes, dogs and humans in this region, 902 nt cDNA fragments containing the G–L intergenic region and encoding the cytoplasmic domain of protein G and a fragment of protein L were obtained by RT–PCR, sequenced and compared. Phylogenetic analysis showed that rabies viruses isolated in foxes, dogs and humans belonged to a single genetic variant. Speculative analysis together with epidemiological data indicated that rabies in foxes may have been due to contact with rabid dogs. Rabies transmission between dogs, wild foxes and humans may happen in natural conditions in northern Colombia. This ﬁnding is the ﬁrst to suggest dog-to-fox rabies transmission in South America, and provides another example of dog rabies variants being able to successfully colonize wildlife hosts.",

            "abstractNote": "While taxonomy is being glorified during the Linnaean 300th anniversary (Anonymous 2007; Hopper 2007), we have observed a dangerous trend in phylogenetics: the placement of taxonomic discoveries in the appendices of science. Studies that aim to address biogeographical or evolutionary hypotheses using phylogenetic analyses have been confronted with the problem of how to proceed with the taxonomic discoveries that emerge during the analysis of the information (e. g. when discovering that a taxon that was thought to be monophyletic is instead paraphyletic). Authors of such studies may be forced by the editorial policy of high impact journals, either to ignore their own taxonomic results or to treat them marginally by including them in on-line appendices (e. g. Wiens et al. 2005; Heinicke et al. 2007). These cases are likely to be more and more common because of the increasing use of phylogenetics without classification purposes (Wheeler 2004; Franz 2005), together with the lack of complete taxonomic knowledge for most organisms (Dubois 2003a). This situation can lead to the production of “phantom taxonomies”: those that first appear in online appendices as downloadable documents, in which both the new taxonomy and the authors are difficult to track. This new term bears a strong resemblance to two other: \"phantom nomina\" as introduced by Vences et al. (1999) and \"phantom references\" (Dubois 1999). The term \"phantom nomina\" refers to new nomina “accidentally” published in amateur publications without proper descriptions and vouchers, while \"phantom references\" point to references that were quoted as \"in press\" or \" in  preparation\" but were never published.",

            "abstractNote": "Anoura is a Neotropical genus of long-tongued bats containing at least 10 species, whose taxonomy has been revised substantially in recent years. Herein, we describe a new species of Anoura from the Cordillera Oriental of the Peruvian Andes, inhabiting montane forests (Yungas) at 1900–3450 m altitude, along the Río Cosñipata valley in Manu Biosphere Reserve, Cuzco; where it is sympatric with A. peruana, A. cultrata, and A. caudifer. This new species is most similar to A. caudifer and A. aequatoris, but it is distinguished from them by a unique combination of morphological characters: pelage dark; uropatagium narrow with margins densely furred; foot claws whitish; skull with a long and narrow rostrum; zygomatic arches complete and straight (in lateral view); posterolateral margins of palate without processes; braincase smoothly rounded; first upper premolar (P2) peg-like and separated from the upper canine by a wide gap; second upper premolar (P3) without anterobasal cusp; mandible long, straight, thin and delicate with a large symphysis. Principal Component Analysis separated well the new species from A. aequatoris and A. caudifer. In MANOVA analyses, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test, the new species differed significantly from A. aequatoris and A. caudifer in six and 11 characters, respectively. The new species and A. aequatoris have montane distributions, whereas A. caudifer occurs at lower elevations. In Peru, the new species and A. aequatoris show disjunct distributions: the former in the central and southern regions, and the latter in the north-central region of the country. This suggests a vicariant effect probably related to the deep Río Apurímac. Finally, we comment on the taxonomy of the A. caudifer complex, discuss the biogeographical implications of the discovery of the new species, and suggest the recognition of a new region of endemism for small mammals in the southern Yungas, south of the Río Apurímac to Bolivia.",

            "abstractNote": "This study documents the mammalian diversity in the Tambopata River middle basin, one of the most important information gaps in Peru. Five sites were evaluated in Puno (San Fermín 850 m, Curva Alegre 950 m, Challohuma 1200 m, Yanahuaya 1600 m, and Yanacocha 1985 m). The trapping effort was 7072 trap-nights and 201 mistnet-nights. 76 species were recorded in the study area, including 16 species under some conservation’s category. Bats and rodents were the most diverse orders (67.5%). The diversity indices of Shannon-Wiener and Simpson for small mammals show a moderate and mild negative correlation with elevation, respectively. Meanwhile the altitude is negatively correlated with the relative abundance (RA) of bats, and positively with the RA of non-volant mammals. The marsupials Marmosa (Micoureus) demerarae, Marmosops bishopi and Marmosops impavidus; the rodent Neacomys musseri, and bats Platyrrhinus albericoi, P. masu, P. nigellus, Eumops auripendulus and Cormura brevirostris are first records for the department of Puno. Akodon baliolus and Oxymycterus juliacae are considered valid species. The species Sturnira lilium and Akodon baliolus were those with the highest RA. Our records, added to published and unpublished data, indicate that the Río Tambopata watershed is habitat of 141 species of mammals. Finally, we recommend the extension of the southern part of the buffer zone of the PNBS to include the montane forests of Yanacocha, to protect the unique middleelevation fauna of the Río Tambopata watershed.",

Here we present the results of an evaluation of mammal diversity of Carpish, Huanuco, a montane forest in a critical state of conservation. The study was carried out between 2001 and 2002 with five expeditions in the localities of Carpish de Mayobamba (2730 – 3080 m) and San Pedro de Carpish (1780 – 2400 m). We used capture methods, sightings and interviews, which represent an effort of 28 500 trap-nights and 190 net-nights. We recorded 35 species of mammals in the study area. The most diverse orders were bats and rodents (74.3%); these include four endemic species for the country, four species in some conservation category and the first record of the gracile opossum Gracilinanus aceramarcae for Huánuco. Species richness and diversity index (H' and Simpson) for rodents show no significant correlation with respect to elevation. The rodent Thomasomys ischyrus and the bat Anoura aequatoris were the species with the highest relative abundance. Our records, plus those from literature and review of scientific collections, support the occurrence of 45 mammal species in the Carpish forest. This species richness, endemism and the accelerated forest loss are the basis for recommending the establishment of a conservation area that guarantees the protection of the Carpish's montane forests.",

Here we report noteworthy range extensions of 12 bat species, including: Diaemus youngi, Chrotopterus auritus, Micronycteris minuta, Mimon crenulatum, Vampyrum spectrum, Chiroderma salvini, Enchisthenes hartii, Noctilio leporinus, Thyroptera discifera, Eptesicus chiriquinus, Rhogeessa io, and Myotis riparius. These document the first confirmed records for the department of Tumbes. All, except E. hartii and N. leporinus, are also first records for the western slope of Peru. The record of R. io is the first for Peru, while that of C. auritus is the first for the Pacific versant of the Andes. In total, 41 bat species are present in the Pacific Tropical rainforests and surrounding dry forests, at the new Parque Nacional Cerros de Amotape, in Tumbes. This region requires urgent conservation programs, because the Pacific Tropical rainforest is threatened by human settlement, and resource exploitation in spite of its protected status.",

            "abstractNote": "Population survey plays an important role in understanding the census structure of any species in a particular area. Chiropterans are an important groups of mammals found almost all part of India. Chiropterans (including Mega and Microchiroptera) are important as they have ubiquitous distribution in almost all the states of India, from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh. They play important roles in all types of ecosystems. Mega chiropterans largely help in pollination, while microchiropterans help in pest control through insectivory. To understand the population structures, the status of bat population and its trend in Cachar district (Assam) north East India was studied. A total of six species and 97 roosting sites were found over approximately 3786 square kilometer of area. The colony size of Pteropus giganteus was found to consist of 13 to 723 individuals, for Cynopterus sphinx it was recorded as 2-9 groups having 8 to 51 individuals (with group size 3 to 8 individuals), for Eonycteris spelae it was 400-600 individuals, for Pipistrellus coromandra, it was very less, as group size was found to be of 3 to 6 individuals and for Megaderma lyra the number recorded was 5 to 128 individuals. Population structure and the prevalence indicate this zone to be a potential area for maintaining a viable population of bat species. Since no prior systematic information on the Chiropteran population is available from the area, the present study will help in formulating conservation plan of the much neglected group of nocturnal mammals.",

Although Costa Rica has been biologically well studied, few areas have complete mammal inventories, which are essential for ecological studies and conservation. The San Vito region is considered among the most important for scientific research in the country because of the presence of the Wilson Botanical Garden and Las Cruces. However, the knowledge of its mammalian fauna is incomplete. We extensively studied the mammals of San Vito, compiled a checklist, and evaluated its composition, relative abundance, habitat distribution, and conservation status. We recorded 105 species, representing 85 genera, 29 families, and 10 orders. Non-volant mammals represented 62 species, 59 genera, 23 families, and 9 orders. Bats belonged to 6 families, 26 genera and 43 species. The extensive deforestation and hunting have caused the extinction of seven species, but the region still supports, surprisingly, a relatively high number of species, most of which are rare. Few species are common and abundant. Species richness was higher in forest, and forest fragments; fewer species were found in coffee plantations, induced grasslands, and secondary vegetation. Around 21% (13 species) are included in the IUCN red book. Three species are considered endangered (Saimiri oerstedii, Tapirus bairdii, and Sylvilagus dicei), and two threatened (Myrmecophaga trydactila and Caluromys derbianus), of which two (T. bairdii and M. trydactila) are locally extinct. The other species in IUCN are either of low risk (i.e. Chironectes minimus) or data deficient (Lontra longicaudis). Additionally, 24 species (39%) are included in CITES. Rev. Biol.

A retrospective study was conducted to describe cases of neoplasia identiﬁed in Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) under human care at the Vancouver Aquarium between 01 January 2013 and 31 March 2021. Approximately 13.2% (N ¼ 47/355) of the bat population died within this time span, and gross and histologic postmortem examinations were performed on 28 of 47 individuals. There were eight malignant and three benign neoplasms detected in 10 cases (eight females, two males), including: malignant histiocytoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, two squamous cell carcinomas, spindle cell sarcoma, periosteal chondrosarcoma, uncharacterized uterine neoplasia with unrelated multicentric pulmonary carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. Benign variants included three suspected uterine leiomyomas. A wide variety of tumor types and tissue predilections were identiﬁed, suggesting a complex and perhaps multifactorial pathogenesis in neoplastic transformation in microchiropterans. To the authors’ knowledge, these tumor types have not been previously described in Artibeus sp., and some of these neoplasms have not previously been reported in chiropterans.",

            "abstractNote": "Genetic mark–recapture methods are increasingly being used to estimate demographic parameters in species where traditional techniques are problematic or imprecise. The federally endangered Indiana bat Myotis sodalis has declined dramatically and threats such as white-nose syndrome continue to afflict this species. To date, important demographic information for Indiana bats has been difficult to estimate precisely using traditional techniques such as emergence counts. Successful management and protection of Indiana bats requires better methods to estimate population sizes and survival rates throughout the year, particularly during summer when these bats reproduce and are widely dispersed away from their winter hibernacula. In addition, the familial makeup of maternity colonies is unknown, yet important for understanding local and regional population dynamics. We had four objectives in this study. For the first two objectives we investigated the potential use of DNA from fecal samples (fecal DNA) collected at roosts to obtain genetically based mark–recapture estimates of 1) colony size and 2) survival rates, for an Indiana bat maternity colony in Indianapolis, Indiana. The third objective was to compare our genetically based colony-size estimates with emergence counts conducted at the same roost tree to evaluate the genetic mark–recapture method. Our fourth objective was to use fecal DNA to estimate levels of relatedness among individuals sampled at the roost. In the summer of 2008, we collected fecal pellets and conducted emergence counts at a prominent roost tree during three time periods each lasting 7 or 8 d. We genotyped fecal DNA using five highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to identify individuals and used a robust-design mark–recapture approach to estimate survival rates as well as colony size at the roost tree. Emergence count estimates at the roost tree ranged from 100 to 215, whereas genetic mark–recapture estimates were higher, ranging from 122 to 266 and more precise. Apparent survival was 0.994 (SE ¼ 0.04) between sampling periods suggesting that few bats died or permanently emigrated during the course of the study. Relatedness estimates, r, between all pairs of individuals averaged 0.055 ranging from 0 to 0.779, indicating that most individuals were not closely related. We demonstrate here the promise of using fecal DNA to estimate demographic information for Indiana bats and potentially other bat species.",

In a screen of 20 individuals from a population in Missouri, the 10 loci were found to have levels of variability ranging from seven to 18 alleles. No loci were found to be linked, although two loci revealed significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These microsatellite loci will be applicable for population genetic analyses and for use in mark-recapture studies that utilize DNA collected non-invasively from fecal pellets, which will ultimately aid in management efforts.",
