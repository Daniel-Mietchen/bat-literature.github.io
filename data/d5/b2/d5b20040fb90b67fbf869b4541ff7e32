Radio tracking was done for ten bats (five males and five females) in September and October 2014. The tracking was done after the transmitter were glued behind bats below their scapula. From this study, the mean home range size of S. kuhlii in agriculture (0.68km2) was higher than that in urban landscape (0.37km2). The overlapping between males and females bats home ranges showed that this occurs due to existence of many food resources in the region. This is an important ecological information so that the conservation effort can be done accordingly. This is due to different species may differ in their responses to environmental factors such as habitat fragmentation.",

The intense echolocation calls of bats are energetically expensive, but their cost can be reduced by synchronizing the exhalations needed to vocalize to wingbeats. Here, we use sound-and-movement recording tags to investigate how wild bats balance efﬁcient sound production with information needs during foraging and navigation. We show that wild bats prioritize energy efﬁciency over sensory ﬂow when periodic snapshots of the acoustic scene are sufﬁcient during travel and search. Rapid calls during tracking and interception of close prey are decoupled from the wingbeat but are weaker and comprise <2% of all calls during a night of hunting. The limited use of fast sonar sampling provides bats with high information update rates during critical hunting moments but adds little to their overall costs of sound production despite the inefﬁciency of decoupling calls from wingbeats.",

We quantiﬁed bats’ performance, sonar beam focus, and sensory acquisition rate. Performance was excellent in straight corridors, with sonar beam aim deviating less than 5  from the corridor midline. Bats anticipated an upcoming abrupt turn to the right or left by slowing ﬂight speed and shifting beam aim to ‘‘look’’ proactively into one side of the corridor to identify the new ﬂightpath. All bats mastered the right turn, but two bats consistently failed the left turn. Bats increased their sensory acquisition rate when confronting abrupt turns in both successful and failed ﬂights. Limitations on biosonar performance reﬂected failures to switch beam aim and to modify a learned spatial map, rather than failures to update acquisition rate.",

However, recent studies have demonstrated that bats are reservoirs of emerging viruses that have spilled over into humans and agricultural animals to cause severe diseases. These viruses include Hendra and Nipah paramyxoviruses, Ebola and Marburg ﬁloviruses, and coronaviruses that are closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, bats that are naturally or experimentally infected with these viruses do not show clinical signs of disease. Here we have reviewed ecological, behavioral, and molecular factors that may inﬂuence the ability of bats to harbor viruses. We have summarized known zoonotic potential of bat-borne viruses and stress on the need for further studies to better understand the evolutionary relationship between bats and their viruses, along with discovering the intrinsic and external factors that facilitate the successful spillover of viruses from bats.",

Only three bat species (e.g., Ia io) known to date can prey on migratory birds. However, how these bats have exploited this challenging dietary niche remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that I. io hunts at the altitude of migrating birds during the bird migration season. The foraging I. io exhibited high ﬂight altitudes (up to 4945 m above sea level) and high ﬂight speeds (up to 143.7 km hÀ1). I. io in ﬂight can actively prey on birds in the night sky via echolocation cues. Genes associated with DNA damage repair, hypoxia adaptation, biting and mastication, and digestion and metabolism have evolved to adapt to this species’ avivorous habits. Our results suggest that the evolution of behavioral innovation and genomic novelty are associated with the exploitation of challenging dietary opportunities.",

The complexity of non-human vocal communication has been under debate one of the main open questions being: What could be the function of multi-syllabic vocal sequences? We address these questions by analyzing fruit-bat vocal communication. We use neural networks to encode the vocalizations, and statistical models to examine the information conveyed by sequences of vocalizations. We show that fruit-bat vocal sequences potentially convey more contextual information than individual syllables, but that the order of the syllables within the sequence is unimportant for context. Speciﬁcally, sequences are composed of slightly modiﬁed syllables, thus increasing the probability of context-speciﬁcity. We note that future behavioral, e.g., playback experiments are needed in order to validate the biological relevance of our statistical results. We hypothesize that such sequences might have served as pre-syntax precursors in the evolution of animal communication.",

The ma jority of captures occurred in secondary forest habitat (99 speci mens belonging to 10 species), followed by primary forest (40 specimens, 5 species), and by the bush (13 specimens, 5 species). A multivariate set of analyses arranged the various species into six 'ecological groups': (i) Eidolon helvum, Mops thersites; (ii) Hip posideros ca.ffer, (iii) Hypsignathus monstrosus; (iv) Rousettus egyptiacus, Epomops franqueti, Scotonycteris zenkeri, Nycteris arge; (v) Saccolaimus peli, Scotophilus viridis, Nycteris hispida; (vi) Epomophorus gambianus, Megaloglossus woermanni.

            "abstractNote": "The history of Italian mammalogy has received so far scanty attention by the scientific community. In the present paper, an homage to Oscar de Beaux is presented 50 years after his death. His scientific activity was characterised by a broad approach to the study of mammals, both in museums and zoos, that was not limited to taxonomy but also included embryology, primatology and conservation. In this latter field, well in advance of his time, de Beaux recognised the strong link existing between taxonomy and conservation 60 years before the Convention on biological diversity being signed in Rio de Janeiro. In his booklet ‘Biological Ethics. An attempt to arouse a naturalistic conscience’ of 1930, rightly recognised as one of the first works on the ethical aspects of conservation, he also stressed the now widely understood role of naturalistic museums, zoos and botanical gardens as centres of environmental education and awareness. Therefore, de Beaux’s work represents not only an important witness of Italian mammalogy, but also a precious heritage for the international scientific community. We hope this paper could help broaden the knowledge of this important scientist in Italy and abroad.",

A total of 152 specimens comprising 15 species in 12 genera from ﬁve families were collected, of which 13 individuals were karyotyped. The most numerous species was Rhinolophus guineensis followed by four fruit bats (Epomops buettikoferi, Lissonycteris angolensis, Roussettus aegyptiacus, Nanonycteris veldkampii). We conﬁrm the presence of Hipposideros lamottei in the mine adits at 1500 m as well as the exceptional diversity of this habitat. First standard karyotypes are provided for Epomops buettikoferi and Nanonycteris intermedia. We also document for the ﬁrst time karyotypes for West African populations of Mops thersites, Lissonycteris angolensis and Roussettus aegyptiacus, and cytogenetical comparisons with the existing literature are provided. We add ﬁve new species to the list of Guinean Nimba and two to the whole Nimba list (including Liberian side), which now stands at 42 species. This conﬁrms the importance of Mount Nimba as a hotspot of diversity and the necessity to protect it.",

All animals were killed with an overdose of sodium pentabarbital administered intraperitoneally. Muscles were dissected free, cleaned of excess fasia, blotted dry and weighed. Their proximal and distal portions were mounted in gum tragacanth on cork, quick-frozen by immersionin isopentane cooled to about -160°C. Transverse serial sections (10-12 ).Jm thickness) were obtained with a freezing cryostat sections from each muscle were stained with Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Tetrazolium Reductase (NADH-TR) to assess oxidative capacity. The method was used demonstate Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) activity. Sections of each muscle were stained using myosin Adenosine Triphosphatase (mATPase). Two fast twitch fiber types are histochemically identified in pectoralis muscles of M. schreibersi. These were classified as type Ila and b according to glycine-calcium-formalin preincubation staining protocol for myosin ATPase. The primary flight muscles, serratus ventalis included type I, Ila and b fibers. Type I fibers in serratus ventralis were highly oxidative as stained darkly for NADH- TR. All type Ila fibers exhibited relatively intense staining properties for NADH-TR and SDH suggesting a intermediate oxidative capacity. InM. schreibersi primary flight muscles, type Ilb fibers were low oxidative as indicated by light reaction for NADH-TR. Fiber ratios of M.schreibersi for the pectoral muscle are fiber type Ila 87% and fiber type Ilb 13%. Fiber ratios for serratus ventralis arefiber type I 14%, fiber type Ila 70% and fiber type Ilb 16%.",

Levels of asymmetry were compared across populations and species, and signi®cant differences were found in both comparisons. Differences coincided with species-speci®c patterns of morphological and genetic differentiation. Concordance of correlation matrices of asymmetry was also compared. Results were signi®cant; concordance is hypothesized to be a by-product of developmental processes that produce the `fox-like' morphology shared by these species. Consistency of asymmetry patterns suggests that the developmental pathway producing it is highly canalized. A prediction of the above hypothesis is that a radical change in the `fox-like' structural pattern would result in breakage of the asymmetry parameter associated with it.",

A truss network is used to quantify changes in the size and shape of the wing membrane during morphogenesis. Growth of the forearm and of third and ®fth digits of the manus are also quanti®ed. Principal component analysis indicates that changes in size of the wing (PC-1) contribute 78% of growth variation, whereas shape changes (PC-2, PC-3) contribute only about 18% of growth variation. ANOVA run on component scores shows signi®cant differences in size (PC-1) of the wing between juveniles and sub-adults, whereas no signi®cant difference in shape (PC-2 and 3) of the wing occurs during morphogenesis. In addition, growth compensation is shown to occur among sequentially developing skeletal elements comprising the hand wing. Coef®cients of variation were signi®cantly higher for phalangeal lengths than for total wing length and width. Compensation scores generated by summing residual scores produced by bivariate plots of wing bone elements show variable levels of compensation among individuals. However, a plot of scores against wing length shows compensation to occur throughout morphogenesis as scores are not correlated with wing size (r = 0.089). Apparently, selection has favoured a developmental system within which wing shape is conserved while simultaneous plasticity in the hand skeleton helps maintain functional integrity during rapid morphogenesis.",

Between November 1994 and February 1996, M. tuberculata were caught in mist-nets, and their faecal pellets were collected for later dietary analysis. In addition, pollen samples were collected from the fur of bats caught during December 1995 and January 1996. Faecal analysis showed that M. tuberculata on Little Barrier Island exhibits a high degree of omnivory, with its diet comprising ¯ying and non-¯ying arthropods, and also pollen and other plant material. During December 1995 and January 1996, the activity levels of both bat species associated with ¯owering and non-¯owering M. excelsa trees were investigated by recording bat echolocation calls with automatic detecting and recording units. Signi®cantly higher numbers of M. tuberculata echolocation calls were recorded near ¯owering M. excelsa trees than near non-¯owering ones, whereas the numbers of C. tuberculatus calls did not differ signi®cantly between ¯owering and non-¯owering trees. These results contribute further to the existing evidence for nectarivory in M. tuberculata.",

Samples were collected from frugivorous bats living in Malaysia that were considered to be a natural reservoir of Nipah virus. There were two kinds of fruit bats, the so-called flying fox and the small fruit bat. Samples were collected from small fruit bats and flying foxes caught by mist net traps. No antibody and no Nipah virus were detected from the samples of small fruit bat. However, an average 18% and 63% positive for antibody were detected from the samples of flying foxes living in the islands (Island flying fox) and peninsula of Malaysia (Malayan flying fox), respectively. Nipah virus was not isolated from either of the flying foxes. However, Nipah virus gene was detected from Malayan flying fox by real-time PCR. Reovirus like virus and other unknown viruses were isolated from Malayan flying foxes. From these results, flying fox was an important natural reservoir of Nipah virus and especially Malayan flying fox was considered to be more important as a natural reservoir.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats emit ultrasonic vocalizations through their mouths or nostrils, listen to echoes returning from surrounding objects, and reconstruct three-dimensional images to navigate in the dark. To perform the reconstruction, bats compare their original emission with returning echoes that have been changed by the surroundings. In natural environments, echolocating bats receive various sensory inputs, including insect echoes, clutter echoes, and pulses and echoes from other bats, which must create a complex acoustic situation. Here, we discuss how bats extract own faint echoes in the presence of noise, by focusing on three similar but different situations; auditory masking, clutter interference, and jamming. Sensitivity to faint echoes is maintained after intense pulse emission, by contraction of middle ear muscles during emission. Echoes from off-axis objects could be “defocused” by comparing spectral features in the pulses and echoes. In the presence of conspecifics, bats increase the intensity and duration of pulses to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of their own echoes. They also regulate spectrotemporal features of pulses to separate their own echoes from sounds of conspecifics. Some of the adaptations made by bats may have future engineering applications for radar or sonar systems.",

            "abstractNote": "Human-wildlife conﬂicts pose a growing threat to many species worldwide and require increasingly innovative and multi-disciplinary resolutions. Because of their apparent simplicity and political appeal, lethal approaches like culling are often favoured, decisions to cull are typically poorly supported by scientiﬁc evidence and the limitations and drawbacks of culls minimised. As natural habitats decline and fruit crop production expands, fruit-eating bats in the Old World (family Pteropodidae) are increasingly in conﬂict with fruit farmers. This conﬂict is exempliﬁed on Mauritius where the government has implemented two mass culls of a threatened ﬂying fox (Pteropus niger) since 2015 in response to fruit-grower concerns. The culls and illegal hunting reduced the bat population by > 50%. In this context, we sought to investigate the ecological role and service provided by the targeted ﬂying fox through seed dissemination to gauge what may be lost as the species becomes rarer or extinct. We randomly sampled the woody native community in six of the best-preserved moist-to-wet native forests of Mauritius using 90 plots of 100 m2 each and identiﬁed and measured the stem size of all woody plants ≥1 cm in diameter. Species were classiﬁed by whether their fruits occur in the diet of the ﬂying fox in an exclusive, conﬁrmed or likely manner and we assumed that fruit consumption is equivalent to potential seed dissemination. The relative importance of these three categories to the total woody plant community was then quantiﬁed as the proportion of species richness, stem density and basal area (as a surrogate of biomass) that they represent. We also investigated whether the main traits of species (seed size, fruit size, and maximum stem diameter) vary among bat-dispersal categories and diﬀer from those of species whose fruits are not currently known to be eaten by the ﬂying fox. On average, although about a quarter of the native woody species (24.6%) have fruits conﬁrmed as eaten and seeds dispersed by the ﬂying fox, these species comprise about half (53.1%) of the stems sampled and the majority (63.1%) of the basal area of native woody plant in the island’s native forests. About half of that latter biomass ﬁgure comprises species for which the ﬂying fox is the exclusive native vertebrate frugivore and seed disperser. Plants disseminated by the ﬂying fox are typically large trees with large fruit and seeds. These trees are often key components of the canopy, therefore fulﬁlling structural engineer roles that provide resources and conditions for the survival of many forest species. The ﬂying fox plays a disproportionally large ecological role in maintaining forest structure and biodiversity in the long-term. Consequently, lethal approaches to the conﬂict with fruit-farmers threaten not only an endangered species, but ecological processes central to the viability of native forests. Our ﬁndings highlight the importance of including the ecological costs of culling in decision-making processes intended to resolve human-wildlife conﬂicts.",

            "abstractNote": "Human-wildlife conﬂicts (HWC) pose a growing threat to biodiversity worldwide and solutions can be as sound as the understanding of the HWC itself. Conservation biologists therefore must carefully examine their local situations to inform on which approach and strategies may be best. In this context, Mauritius implemented what may be the ﬁrst mass-culls of an already threatened native species when it culled the ﬂying fox (Pteropus niger) in 2015 and 2016 to try increase fruit producers’ proﬁts. Although the Red List category of the species consequently worsened to ‘Endangered’ and fruit production dropped substantially, a third mass-cull was decided in 2018. A critical analysis is important to draw lessons that may help to prevent recurrences particularly that HWC involving Pteropus spp. are common and set to worsen. We synthesized the best literature available locally and also elsewhere in relevant situations, to critically appraise the setting, nature, timeline of events and outcome of both completed mass-culling campaigns to explore why and how they happened so as to help towards devising better approaches to such conﬂicts. The idea to cull P. niger originated around 2002 and a small cull was done in 2006. The ﬁrst mass-cull started immediately after Mauritius’ biodiversity protection law was weakened in 2015 primarily to legalize culls of threatened native species, but still breached the law in place then. The 2016 masscull was recommended in line with the law, but was not evidence-based and consequently did not result in improved proﬁts of fruit producers. Appeals supported by best scientiﬁc evidence from local and international organizations and conservationists to the eﬀect that culls will not increase fruit production, but instead further endanger the species, were ignored. To forestall recurrences here and elsewhere, it matters to recognize their precursor signs and the conditions that favoured them including why the mass-culls were not stopped. The events provide a rare opportunity to explore the strategy that was used by conservationists and open the way to propose impactful alternatives or additional actions instead. The situation also exempliﬁes an eroding commitment towards biodiversity conservation, eased by withdrawal from evidence-based policy that suit short term goals of election cycles at the expense of longer term environmental interests.",

            "abstractNote": "Due to their ability to disperse over water, over half of the extant bat species occur on islands and ca. 25% of these are island endemics. They are often the sole native island mammals and play key roles in the maintenance of insular ecosystems. Yet, due to increasing anthropogenic pressures, ca. 60% of island-restricted bats are now threatened. The sub-tropical island of Madeira is home to the Macaronesian endemic Pipistrellus maderensis, to Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus - an endemic subspecies to Madeira - and Plecotus austriacus. These species each represent the three main foraging guilds of insectivorous bats namely, edge space foragers, open space foragers and narrow space foragers. Despite the great conservation value and potential to provide pest suppression ser­ vices, little is known about the habitat associations of Macaronesian bats. We used low-cost autonomous sensors to conduct an island-wide bioacoustic survey to investigate how Madeiran bats are affected by human-induced land-use change and orography. Overall we obtained >63,000 bat passes across 216 sites and at each site, we quantified land-use cover and altitude within a radius of 250, 500 and 1000 m. Pipistrellus maderensis was the most widespread and commonly recorded species, whereas Plecotus austriacus had the most restricted distribution and lowest number of detected bat passes. We found species-specific and scale-dependent responses to land-use cover, with the activity of Pipistrellus maderensis being positively associated with landscape-scale shrubland, cropland and Laurisilva (primary forest) cover, whereas the activity of Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus and Plecotus austriacus were negatively influenced by Laurisilva and cropland cover, respectively. Furthermore, we found that altitude had a negative effect on the activity of Nyctalus leisleri verrucosus and Plecotus austriacus. This study provides the first insights into the effects of land-use type on Madeiran bats and showcases the great potential of low-cost bioacoustic detectors for island-wide bat surveys.",

            "abstractNote": "Some tetrapods hang upside down from tree branches when moving horizontally. The ability to walk in quadrupedal suspension has been acquired independently in at least 14 mammalian lineages. During the stance (supportive) phase of quadrupedal suspension, the elbow joint ﬂexor muscles (not the extensors as in upright vertebrates moving overground) are expected to contract to maintain the ﬂexed limb posture. Therefore muscular control in inverted, suspended quadrupeds may require changes of muscle control, and even morphologies, to conditions opposite to those in upright animals. However, the relationships between musculoskeletal morphologies and elbow joint postures during the stance phase in suspended quadrupeds have not been investigated. Our analysis comparing postures and skeletal morphologies in Choloepus (Pilosa), Pteropus (Chiroptera), Nycticebus (Primates) and Cynocephalus (Dermoptera) revealed that the elbow joints of these animals were kept at ﬂexed angles of 70–100 ° during the stance phase of quadrupedal suspension. At these joint angles the moment arms of the elbow joint ﬂexors were roughly maximized, optimizing that component of antigravity support. Our additional measurements from various mammalian species show that suspended quadrupeds have relatively small extensor ⁄ ﬂexor ratios in both muscle masses and maximum moment arms. Thus, in contrast to the pattern in normal terrestrial quadrupeds, suspended quadrupeds emphasize ﬂexor over extensor muscles for body support. This condition has evolved independently multiple times, attendant with a loss or reduction of the ability to move in normal upright postures.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat wings, like other mammalian forelimbs, contain many joints within the digits. These joints collectively affect dynamic three-dimensional (3D) wing shape, thereby affecting the amount of aerodynamic force a wing can generate. Bats are a speciose group, and show substantial variation in the number of wing joints. Additionally, some bat species have joints with extensor but no ﬂexor muscles. While several studies have examined the diversity in number of joints and presence of muscles, musculoskeletal variation in the digits has not been interpreted in phylogenetic, functional or ecological contexts. To provide this context, the number of joints and the presence/absence of muscles are quantiﬁed for 44 bat species, and are mapped phylogenetically. It is shown that, relative to the ancestral state, joints and muscles were lost multiple times from different digits and in many lineages. It is also shown that joints lacking ﬂexors undergo cyclical ﬂexion and extension, in a manner similar to that observed in joints with both ﬂexors and extensors. Comparison of species with contrasting feeding ecologies demonstrates that species that feed primarily on non-mobile food (e.g. fruit) have fewer fully active joints than species that catch mobile prey (e.g. insects). It is hypothesized that there is a functional trade-off between energetic savings and maneuverability. Having fewer joints and muscles reduces the mass of the wing, thereby reducing the energetic requirements of ﬂapping ﬂight, and having more joints increases the assortment of possible 3D wing shapes, thereby enhancing the range and ﬁne control of aerodynamic force production and thus maneuverability.",

Bats have a wide range of dietary habits and include carnivorous, haematophagous, insectivorous, frugivorous and nectivorous species. The salivary glands of these species have been of particular research interest due to their structural variability among chiropterans with different types of diets. Myoepithelial cells (MECs), which support and facilitate the expulsion of saliva from the secretory portions of salivary glands, are very important for their function; however, this cell type has not been extensively studied in the salivary glands of bats. In this study, we characterized the MECs in the major salivary glands of the fruit bat Artibeus jamaicensis. Herein, we describe the morphology of the parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands of A. jamaicensis at the light- and electro-microscopic level and the distribution of MECs in these glands, as deﬁned by their expression of smooth-muscle markers such as a-smooth muscle actin (SMAa) and desmin, and of epithelial cell markers, such as KRT14. We found that the anatomical locations of the major salivary glands in this bat species are similar to those of humans, except that the bat sublingual gland appears to be unique, extending to join the contralateral homologous gland. Morphologically, the parotid gland has the characteristics of a mixed-secretory gland, whereas the submandibular and sublingual glands were identiﬁed as mucous-secretory glands. MECs positive for SMAa, KRT14 and desmin were found in all of the structural components of the three glands, except in their excretory ducts. Desmin is expressed at a lower level in the parotid gland than in the other glands. Our results suggest that the major salivary glands of A. jamaicensis, although anatomically and structurally similar to those of humans, play different physiological roles that can be attributed to the dietary habits of this species.",

            "abstractNote": "Unlike birds and insects, bats ﬂy with wings composed of thin skin that envelops the bones of the forelimb and spans the area between the limbs, digits, and sometimes the tail. This skin is complex and unusual; it is thinner than typical mammalian skin and contains organized bundles of elastin and embedded skeletal muscles. These elements are likely responsible for controlling the shape of the wing during ﬂight and contributing to the aerodynamic capabilities of bats. We examined the arrangement of two macroscopic architectural elements in bat wings, elastin bundles and wing membrane muscles, to assess the diversity in bat wing skin morphology. We characterized the plagiopatagium and dactylopatagium of 130 species from 17 families of bats using crosspolarized light imaging. This method revealed structures with distinctive relative birefringence, heterogeneity of birefringence, variation in size, and degree of branching. We used previously published anatomical studies and tissue histology to identify birefringent structures, and we analyzed their architecture across taxa. Elastin bundles, muscles, neurovasculature, and collagenous ﬁbers are present in all species. Elastin bundles are oriented in a predominantly spanwise or proximodistal direction, and there are ﬁve characteristic muscle arrays that occur within the plagiopatagium, far more muscle than typically recognized. These results inform recent functional studies of wing membrane architecture, support the functional hypothesis that elastin bundles aid wing folding and unfolding, and further suggest that all bats may use these architectural elements for ﬂight. All species also possess numerous muscles within the wing membrane, but the architecture of muscle arrays within the plagiopatagium varies among families. To facilitate present and future discussion of these muscle arrays, we reﬁne wing membrane muscle nomenclature in a manner that reﬂects this morphological diversity. The architecture of the constituents of the skin of the wing likely plays a key role in shaping wings during ﬂight.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              The synchronization of flight mechanics with respiration and echolocation call emission by bats, while economizing these behaviors, presumably puts compressive loads on the cartilaginous rings that hold open the respiratory tract. Previous work has shown that during postnatal development of\n              Artibeus jamaicensis\n              (Phyllostomidae), the onset of adult echolocation call emission rate coincides with calcification of the larynx, and the development of flight coincides with tracheal ring calcification. In the present study, I assessed the level of reinforcement of the respiratory system in 13 bat species representing six families that use stereotypical modes of echolocation (i.e. duty cycle % and intensity). Using computed tomography, the degree of mineralization or ossification of the tracheal rings, cricoid, thyroid and arytenoid cartilages were determined for non‐echolocators, tongue clicking, low‐duty cycle low‐intensity, low‐duty cycle high‐intensity, and high‐duty cycle high‐intensity echolocating bats. While all bats had evidence of cervical tracheal ring mineralization, about half the species had evidence of thoracic tracheal ring calcification. Larger bats (\n              Phyllostomus hastatus\n              and Pterpodidae sp.) exhibited more extensive tracheal ring mineralization, suggesting an underlying cause independent of laryngeal echolocation. Within most of the laryngeally echolocating species, the degree of mineralization or ossification of the larynx was dependent on the mode of echolocation system used. Low‐duty cycle low‐intensity bats had extensively mineralized cricoids, and zero to very minor mineralization of the thyroids and arytenoids. Low‐duty cycle high‐intensity bats had extensively mineralized cricoids, and patches of thyroid and arytenoid mineralization. The high‐duty cycle high‐intensity rhinolophids and hipposiderid had extensively ossified cricoids, large patches of ossification on the thyroids, and heavily ossified arytenoids. The high‐duty cycle high‐intensity echolocator,\n              Pteronotus parnellii\n              , had mineralization patterns and laryngeal morphology very similar to the other low‐duty cycle high‐intensity mormoopid species, perhaps suggesting relatively recent evolution of high‐duty cycle echolocation in\n              P. parnellii\n              compared with the Old World high‐duty cycle echolocators (Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae). All laryngeal echolocators exhibited mineralized or ossified lateral expansions of the cricoid for articulation with the inferior horn of the thyroid, these were most prominent in the high‐duty cycle high‐intensity rhinolophids and hipposiderid, and least prominent in the low‐duty cycle low‐intensity echolocators. The non‐laryngeal echolocators had extensively ossified cricoid and thyroid cartilages, and no evidence of mineralization/ossification of the arytenoids or lateral expansions of the cricoid. While the non‐echolocators had extensive ossification of the larynx, it was inconsistent with that seen in the laryngeal echolocators.",

The low body mass of juvenile bats may be a result of stresses associated with the initiation of flight, or may be an adaptation to reduce flight costs.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    To test these hypotheses, the body masses of adults and unknown aged juvenile big brown bats (\n                    Eptesicus fuscus\n                    ) were separately compared in August 1990 through to 1995. It was hypothesized that there should be little variation in the body mass of juveniles from year to year if low body mass is an adaption to reduce flight costs.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    The foraging behaviour and body masses of bats of known or estimated age were also compared in 1994 and 1995. Ambient temperature at sunset was greater in 1994 than in 1995. It was assumed that prey density and predictability increased with temperature, and hypothesized that if low body mass results from energetic stress, then this should be more apparent in 1995. Using radiotelemetry, the foraging behaviour of juvenile, yearling and adult\n                    E. fuscus\n                    was compared in 1994 and 1995 to determine whether young bats attempt to compensate for energetic shortfalls by foraging for longer, or emerging earlier, than adults.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Unknown‐aged juveniles did not differ significantly in body mass in August from 1990 through to 1995. Adults were significantly heavier in August in 1990 and 1994 than in 1991, 1993 and 1995. Known‐aged juveniles had lower body mass than adults in 1994, and lower wing loading than adults in 1995. Known‐aged juveniles did not differ in mass between 1994 and 1995, while adults were heavier in 1994.\n                \n                \n                  The foraging times for juvenile and adult bats were both significantly related to ambient temperature. However, the slope of this relationship was steeper for weaned juveniles than for adults. The foraging times of yearling and adults bats were not significantly different.\n                \n                \n                  The emergence times of juvenile and adult bats did not differ, nor did the emergence times of yearlings and adults. Emergence time did not differ significantly between 1994 and 1995.\n                \n                \n                  The results of the study suggest that juvenile bats maintain a low body mass even under conditions that permit adults to accumulate greater fat deposits. Juveniles do not forage earlier or for longer to compensate for poor foraging ability and increased energy expenditures resulting from the onset of flight. This suggests that, by maintaining a low body mass, juveniles reduce flight costs and the risk of predation at a time when flight and foraging are still developing.",

We address two main questions: (i) do parasites prefer vulnerable or well‐fed hosts, and (ii) to what extent is a parasite species specialized towards a given host species?\n                \n                \n                  \n                    To answer these questions, we investigated, both in the field and in the lab, a host–parasite system comprising one ectoparasitic mite (\n                    Spinturnix myoti\n                    ) and its major hosts, two sibling species of bats (\n                    Myotis myotis\n                    and\n                    M. blythii\n                    ), which coexist intimately in colonial nursery roosts. We exploited the close physical associations between host species in colonial roosts as well as naturally occurring annual variation in food abundance to investigate the relationships between parasite intensities and (i) host species and (ii) individual nutritional status.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Although horizontal transmission of parasites was facilitated by the intimate aggregation of bats within their colonial clusters, we found significant interspecific differences in degree of infestation throughout the 6 years of the study, with\n                    M. myotis\n                    always more heavily parasitized than\n                    M. blythii\n                    . This pattern was replicated in a laboratory experiment in which any species‐specific resistance induced by exploitation of different trophic niches in nature was removed.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Within both host species,\n                    S. myoti\n                    showed a clear preference for individuals with higher nutritional status. In years with high resource abundance, both bat hosts harboured more parasites than in low‐resource years, although the relative difference in parasite burden across species was maintained. This pattern of host choice was also replicated in the laboratory. When offered a choice, parasites always colonized better‐fed individuals.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  These results show first that host specialization in our study system occurred. Second, immediate parasite choice clearly operated towards the selection of hosts in good nutritional state.",

Aerodynamic theory is used to predict the most economical flight speeds, minimizing energy expenditure either per distance (maximal range speed,\n                    V\n                    mr\n                    ) or per time (minimal power speed,\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    ). When foraging in flight, flight speed also affects prey encounter and energy intake rates. According to optimal flight speed theory, such effects may shift the energetically optimal foraging speed to above\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Therefore, we predicted that if energetic considerations indeed have a substantial effect on flight speed of aerial‐hawking bats, they will use high speed (close to\n                    V\n                    mr\n                    ) to commute from their daily roost to the foraging sites, while a slower speed (but still above\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    ) will be preferred during foraging. To test these predictions, echolocation calls of commuting and foraging\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii\n                    were recorded and their flight tracks were reconstructed using an acoustic flight path tracking system.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Confirming our qualitative prediction, commuting flight was found to be significantly faster than foraging flight (9·3 vs. 6·7 m s\n                    −1\n                    ), even when controlling for its lower tortuosity.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    In order to examine our quantitative prediction, we compared observed flight speeds with\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    and\n                    V\n                    mr\n                    values generated for the study population using two alternative aerodynamic models, based on mass and wing morphology variables measured from bats we captured while commuting. The\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    and\n                    V\n                    mr\n                    values generated by one of the models were much lower than our measured flight speed. According to the other model used, however, measured foraging flight was faster than\n                    V\n                    mp\n                    and commuting flight slightly slower than\n                    V\n                    mr\n                    , which is in agreement with the predictions of optimal flight speed theory.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Thus, the second aerodynamic model we used seems to be a reasonable predictor of the different flight speeds used by the bats while foraging and while commuting. This supports the hypothesis that bats fly at a context‐dependent, energetically optimal flight speed.",

First‐year survival [range: 0·23 (95% CL = 0·14, 0·35) to 0·46 (95% CL = 0·34, 0·57)] was considerably lower than adult survival and depended on pup date of birth, such that young born earlier in the summer (\n              c.\n              late May) had a significantly higher probability of surviving their first year than young born later in the summer (\n              c.\n              mid‐July).

The benefits of aggregation of conspecific individuals are central to Allee effects, which have led to the widely held assumption that social species are more prone to Allee effects. Robust evidence for this assumption, however, remains rare. Furthermore, previous research on Allee effects has failed to adequately address the consequences of the different levels of organisation within social species’ populations.\n                \n                \n                  Here, we review available evidence of Allee effects and model the role of demographic and behavioural factors that may combine to dampen or strengthen Allee effects in social species. We use examples across various species with contrasting social structure, including carnivores, bats, primates and eusocial insects. Building on this, we provide a conceptual framework that allows for the integration of different Allee effects in social species.\n                \n                \n                  Social species are characterised by nested levels of organisation. The benefits of cooperation, measured by mean individual fitness, can be observed at both the population and group levels, giving rise to “population level” and “group level” Allee effects respectively. We also speculate on the possibility of a third level, reporting per capita benefits for different individuals within a group (e.g. castes in social insects).\n                \n                \n                  We show that group size heterogeneity and intergroup interactions affect the strength of population‐level demographic Allee effects. Populations with higher group size heterogeneity and in which individual social groups cooperate demonstrate the weakest Allee effects and may thus provide an explanation for why extinctions due to Allee effects are rare in social species.\n                \n                \n                  More adequately accounting for Allee effects in social species will improve our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary implications of cooperation in social species.",

We predict that individual bats will show functional dietary differences consistent with energetic requirements and hunting skills.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We used DNA metabarcoding to determine the diet of 126 Mediterranean horseshoe bats (\n                    Rhinolophus euryale\n                    ) from two different sites during three seasons. Simultaneously, we measured moth availability and characterized the traits of 290 moth taxa. Next, we explored the relationship between phylogeny and traits of all consumed and available moth taxa. Finally, we assessed the relationship between individual traits of bats and traits related to prey profitability, for which we used the RLQ and fourth‐corner statistical techniques.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Seasonality was the main factor explaining the functional dietary variation in adult bats, with moths consumed irrespective of their phylogenetic relationships. While adults consumed moths with a broad range in wing loading, body mass and echolocation detection ability, juveniles consumed slower, smaller and lighter moths, which suggests that young individuals may undergo some fitness gain and/or psychomotor learning process during which they would acquire more effective foraging skills.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Our approach revealed a degree of functional flexibility in the trophic niche previously unknown for an insectivorous bat.\n                    Rhinolophus euryale\n                    consumed a wide variety of moth taxa differing in profitability throughout seasons and between ontogenetic stages.

However, host–parasite relationships are merged within different taxonomic groups and factors shaping these interactions likely differ between host and parasite groups, making group‐level differences important to better understand the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of these interactive communities.\n                \n                \n                  Here we used a dataset of 629 ectoparasite species and 251 species of terrestrial mammals, comprising 10 orders distributed across the Nearctic and Neotropical regions of Mexico to assess the species‐level drivers of mammalian ectoparasite faunas. Specifically, we evaluated whether body weight, geographical range size and within‐range mammal species richness (i.e. diversity field) predict mammal ectoparasite species richness (i.e. degree centrality) and their closeness centrality within the mammal–ectoparasite network. In addition, we also tested if the observed patterns differ among mammal orders and if taxonomic closely related host mammals could more likely share the same set of ectoparasites.\n                \n                \n                  We found that ectoparasite species richness of small mammals (mainly rodents) with large proportional range sizes was high compared to large‐bodied mammals, whereas the diversity field of mammals had no predictive value (except for bats). We also observed that taxonomic proximity was a main determinant of the probability to share ectoparasite species. Specifically, the probability to share ectoparasites in congeneric species reached up to 90% and decreased exponentially as the taxonomic distance increased.\n                \n                \n                  Further, we also detected that some ectoparasites are generalists and capable to infect mammalian species across different orders and that rodents have a remarkable role in the network structure, being closely connected to many other taxa.\n                \n                \n                  Hence, because many rodent species have synanthropic habits they could act as undesired reservoirs of disease agents for humans and urban animals. Considering the reported worldwide phenomenon of the proliferation of rodents accompanying the demographic decrease or even local extinction of large‐bodied mammal species, these organisms may already be an increasing health threat in many regions of the world.",

While these local density increases have been previously described, the hypothesis that crowding disrupts demographic processes remains largely untested.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Here we used the sudden flooding of a river valley by a hydroelectric reservoir as a quasi‐experiment to investigate the consequences of crowding on demography, fecundity and social structure in the European free‐tailed bat\n                    Tadarida teniotis\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We monitored bat populations at roosts near and far from the flooded area, before (2013–2014), during (2015) and after (2016) habitat flooding. We assessed population demographic parameters using Capture–Mark–Recapture (CMR) models (3,821 PIT‐tagged individuals), and used genetic relatedness among individuals (1,407 individuals genotyped for 14 microsatellite markers) to infer changes in social structure.\n                \n                \n                  Habitat loss through flooding was associated with significant but transitory increases in the number of bats using nearby roosts. This may be related to the higher probability of individuals arriving at those roosts during flooding, together with increases in individual local residency through time, particularly among males. Individual apparent survival was highest during flooding and lowest in the following year, while the probability of leaving a roost safe from flooding was higher near the impact area than farther away. Crowding did not negatively affect fecundity, but the arrival of new individuals led to changes in social structure as revealed by lower genetic relatedness between individuals after disturbance at roosts near the flooding area, but not in those farther afield.\n                \n                \n                  Our study documents a clear example of crowding effects, suggesting that bats losing roosts due to a hydroelectric reservoir moved to alternative roosts, where local increases in population size and the arrival of new individuals reduced genetic relatedness and apparent survival, but not fecundity. These results support the hypothesis that crowding after habitat loss can disrupt population processes, even though effects may be subtle and short‐lived. Also, they point out the need to duly consider crowding effects when assessing and mitigating anthropogenic impacts on animal populations.",

Insights from models inherently depend on the way contacts between hosts are modelled, and crucially, how transmission scales with animal density.\n                \n                \n                  Bats are important reservoirs of zoonotic disease and are among the most gregarious of all mammals. Their population structures can be highly heterogeneous, underpinned by ecological processes across different scales, complicating assumptions regarding the nature of contacts and transmission. Although models commonly parameterise transmission using metrics of total abundance, whether this is an ecologically representative approximation of host–pathogen interactions is not routinely evaluated.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We collected a 13‐month dataset of tree‐roosting\n                    Pteropus\n                    spp. from 2,522 spatially referenced trees across eight roosts to empirically evaluate the relationship between total roost abundance and tree‐level measures of abundance and density—the scale most likely to be relevant for virus transmission. We also evaluate whether roost features at different scales (roost level, subplot level, tree level) are predictive of these local density dynamics.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Roost‐level features were not representative of tree‐level abundance (bats per tree) or tree‐level density (bats per m\n                    2\n                    or m\n                    3\n                    ), with roost‐level models explaining minimal variation in tree‐level measures. Total roost abundance itself was either not a significant predictor (tree‐level 3D density) or only weakly predictive (tree‐level abundance).\n                  \n                \n                \n                  This indicates that basic measures, such as total abundance of bats in a roost, may not provide adequate approximations for population dynamics at scales relevant for transmission, and that alternative measures are needed to compare transmission potential between roosts. From the best candidate models, the strongest predictor of local population structure was tree density within roosts, where roosts with low tree density had a higher abundance but lower density of bats (more spacing between bats) per tree.\n                \n                \n                  Together, these data highlight unpredictable and counterintuitive relationships between total abundance and local density. More nuanced modelling of transmission, spread and spillover from bats likely requires alternative approaches to integrating contact structure in host–pathogen models, rather than simply modifying the transmission function.",

This information is key for the conservation of threatened nectarivore species, such as the Cerrado‐endemic\n                    Lonchophylla dekeyseri\n                    , for which data on its specialization on floral‐resources is scarce.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Within a seasonal and heterogeneous savanna in the central Brazilian Cerrado, we performed a year‐round assessment of an inclusive assemblage of flower‐visiting bats (both nectarivores and other guilds that can also feed on nectar) within a savanna‐edge‐forest gradient, the phenological trends and spatial distribution of bat and their resource plants, and the resultant temporal and spatial interaction networks between bats and plants in order to associate network structure to resource availability.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Clear spatiotemporal trends emerged in the community. Nectarivores dominated the flower‐visiting niche outside forests and were prolific floral visitors, resulting in networks with lower specialization and modularity. These bats diverged into savanna foragers active during the wet season and the wet‐dry transition, and edge foragers active mostly during the dry season. The latter group encompassed\n                    L. dekeyseri\n                    , which visited mostly\n                    Bauhinia\n                    species. Frugivores took over as main floral visitors within forests, as well as during peak dry season, when fewer fruits were available, resulting in more specialized and modular networks.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Our work shows that the turnover of floral resources across seasons and vegetation types has a defining role in bat–plant interactions and relates to network structure, as bat trophic guilds interact with plants in distinct habitats and times of the year. Frugivores dominate the flower‐visiting niche in certain temporal and spatial subsets of the network, which calls for the inclusion of this guild in future studies. Moreover, the high visitation to\n                    Bauhinia\n                    species by\n                    L. dekeyseri\n                    during the dry season might reduce competition with other nectarivores and is relevant to the management of the species, although more data is needed on its resource consumption on a larger time frame and across its geographic range.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Resumo\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    Morcegos visitantes florais são importantes componentes de comunidades tropicais de polinizadores, apesar de pouco ser conhecido sobre a estrutura de suas redes de polinização com plantas e como a disponibilidade de recursos através do tempo (estações) e espaço (heterogeneidade espacial) afeta a intensidade com a qual morcegos interagem com plantas na escala de comunidades. Estas são informações chave para a conservação de espécies ameaçadas de nectarívoros, como o morcego endêmico do Cerrado\n                    Lonchophylla dekeyseri\n                    , para o qual dados sobre especialização em recursos florais são escassos.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Na savana sazonal e heterogênea do Cerrado central brasileiro, nós realizamos uma avaliação de uma assembleia de morcegos visitantes florais (incluindo nectarívoros e outras guildas que também podem alimentar‐se de néctar) ao longo de um ano em um gradiente savana‐borda‐floresta, explorando as tendências fenológicas e distribuição espacial de morcegos e de suas plantas recurso, assim como a redes espaciais e temporais resultantes entre morcegos e plantas com o objetivo de associar a disponibilidade de recurso à sua estrutura.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Claros padrões espaciotemporais emergiram na comunidade. Nectarívoros dominaram o nicho de visitação floral fora das florestas e foram visitantes prolíficos, resultando em redes marcadas por baixa especialização e modularidade. Estes morcegos divergiram entre aqueles que forrageiam em savanas e durante a estação chuvosa ou na transição chuva‐seca, e aqueles forrageando nas bordas de mata e ativos principalmente na estação seca. Estes últimos incluíram\n                    L. dekeyseri\n                    , a qual visitou primariamente espécies de\n                    Bauhinia\n                    . Frugívoros dominaram o papel de visitantes florais dentro de florestas, assim como durante o pico da estação seca quando há menor disponibilidade de frutos, o que resultou em redes mais especializadas e modulares.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Mostramos que a substituição de recursos florais ao longo das estações e de tipos de vegetação tem um papel preponderante nas interações morcego‐planta e está relacionada à estrutura de rede, pois guildas tróficas interagem com plantas em habitas e em períodos do ano distintos. Frugívoros dominam o nicho de visitante floral em determinados subconjuntos temporais e espaciais da rede, o que destaca a importância de inclusão desta guilda em estudos futuros. Além disso, a forte visitação a espécies de\n                    Bauhinia\n                    por\n                    L. dekeiseri\n                    durante a estação seca pode resultar em uma competição reduzida com outros nectarívoros e é uma informação relevante para seu manejo da espécie, apesar de dados do consumo de recursos pela espécie em janelas temporais maiores e em toda sua extensão de ocorrência são necessários.",

Niche theory predicts that increasing species richness in assemblages can either lead to denser packing of niche space (‘niche packing’) or an expansion into its novel regions (‘niche expansion’). Traditionally, these scenarios have been studied using functional traits but stable isotopes provide advantages such as identifying the degree of resource specialisation, or niche partitioning among functionally similar species.\n                \n                \n                  In this study, we evaluate the relevance of niche packing versus niche expansion by investigating stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic niche width and overlap among 23 bat species from six functional groups across a 1500 m elevational gradient in the Himalaya.\n                \n                \n                  Our results suggest that an increase in species richness in the low elevation is accompanied by small niche width with high overlap, whereas the high elevation assemblage shows large niche width with low overlap among functional group members. At the functional group level, edge‐space foraging, trawling, and active gleaning bats have the highest niche width while passive gleaning bats that are only found in high elevations are isotopic specialists showing low overlap with other groups. Edge and open‐space foraging bats showed idiosyncratic changes in niche width across elevations. We also find that the niches of rhinolophid bats overlap with edge‐space and open‐space foraging bats despite their unique functional traits.\n                \n                \n                  These results support the idea that at low elevations high species richness is associated with niche packing while at high elevations strong niche partitioning prevails in dynamic and resource‐poor environments. We conclude that although high elevation animal assemblages are often ‘functionally underdispersed’, that is show homogenous functional traits, our approach based on stable isotopes demonstrates niche partitioning among such functionally similar species.\n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            सारांश\n            \n              \n                \n                  पर्वतीय क्षेत्रों में ऊंचाई के अनुसार जैव प्रजातियों की संख्या में परिवर्तन होना एक स्तापित क्रिया है। ‘नीश’ सिद्धांत के अनुसार एक क्षेत्र में विद्यमान प्रजातियों की संख्या में वृद्धि के दो कारक हैं: (i) जैव समुदाय की सदस्य प्रजातियों की ‘नीश’ के घनत्व में वृद्धि (यानि ‘नीश पैकिंग’), या फिर (ii) कुछ सदस्य प्रजातियों की ‘नीश’ में फैलाव (यानि ‘नीश एक्सपेंशन’)। इन दो स्थितियों की जांच आइसोटोप के माध्यम से अध्ययन से अलग‐अलग प्राणियों के आहार और वास स्थलों (जो उनकी नीश के मुख्य भाग है) का अनुमान लगाया जा सकता है, और जाना जा सकता है की विभिन्न प्रजातियां आहार व वास स्थलों का किस प्रकार परस्पर विभाजन करती हैं।\n                \n                \n                  किये गए शोध से हमने १५०० से ३००० मी की ऊंचाई में फैले चमगादड़ों के समुदाय में आइसोटोप अध्ययन के उपयोग से ‘नीश पैकिंग’ व ‘एक्सपेंशन’ का आंकलन किया। इस समुदाय में चमगादड़ों की २३ प्रजातियाँ मौजूद हैं।\n                \n                \n                  इस शोध से हमने पाया कि कम ऊँचाई वाले क्षेत्रों में चमगादड़ों की विविधता सदस्य प्रजातियों की नीश में अधिक घनत्व है। वहीं दूसरी ओर, ऊँचे क्षेत्रों में कम विविधता पायी जाती है, और सदस्य प्रजातियों की नीश में साफ़ विभाजन प्रतीत होता है। जो प्रजातियाँ वनों के किनारों में आहार तलाशती हैं, जल सतह के ऊपर मंडराते कीड़ों का शिकार करती हैं, या वृक्षों से कीड़े प्राप्त करती हैं, उनकी नीश सबसे विस्तृत पायी गयी। यह सामने आया कि ऊँचे क्षेत्रों में पाए जाने वाले लम्बे कानों वाले चमगादड़ केवल कुछ चुनिंदा पदार्थों का ही सेवन करते हैं। राइनोलॉफिडी परिवार के चमगादड़ों की नीश वनों के किनारों पर रहने वाले, और हवा में उड़कर शिकार करने वाले चमगादड़ों के सामान पाई गयीं।\n                \n                \n                  चमगादड़ों को उदाहरण मानकर हमारे शोध के परिणाम इस बात की पुष्टि करते हैं कि जैव प्रजातियों की विविधता बढ़ने पर निचले क्षेत्रों में ‘नीश पैकिंग’ सक्रिय होती है, जबकि ऊँचे क्षेत्रों की कठिन परिस्थितियों में जीव परस्पर प्रतिस्पर्धा घटाने के लिए अपने नीश का विभाजन करते हैं। पारम्परिक तकनीकों की तुलना में आइसोटोप अध्ययन तकनीक नीश क्रियाओं का सूक्ष्म अध्ययन करने में कहीं अधिक कारगर हैं।",

We combined this with data from hunter license sales and population projection models to assess the impact and sustainability of current hunting practices in Peninsular Malaysia.\n            \n            \n              3.\n              We monitored 33 active\n              Pteropus vampyrus\n              roost sites in Peninsular Malaysia, including eight seasonal roost sites. Roost site occupancy showed considerable temporal variation over the 3‐year study period.\n            \n            \n              4.\n              Hunting activity has more than doubled since 1996, and based on license sales, we estimate that a minimum legal harvest of 87 800 bats occurred between 2002 and 2005. Population models suggest that this level of hunting is likely to be unsustainable given our baseline abundance scenarios of 100 000, 250 000 or 500 000 bats, especially considering that these models do not include culling of Malayan flying foxes as agricultural pests or illegal hunting activities, for which there are no available data.\n            \n            \n              5.\n              Satellite telemetry of seven adult male bats show that Malayan flying foxes are highly mobile, travelling hundreds of kilometres between roosting sites within a year and occupying home ranges that extend beyond Malaysia to include Indonesia and Thailand. We conclude that focal hunting pressure in Malaysia threatens a regional population of this migratory mammal.\n            \n            \n              6.\n              Synthesis and applications.\n              This is the first study of its kind on flying foxes in Asia, and illustrates that bats, like other migratory species, urgently require comprehensive protection by regional management plans across their range.\n              P. vampyrus\n              moves across international borders in Southeast Asia. Current hunting practices within Malaysia together with limited protection in other countries may threaten its long‐term survival.",

To avoid energetic mismatches caused by limited foraging time and stochastic weather conditions, bats employ the energy‐saving state of torpor during summer to save accumulated energy reserves.\n                \n                \n                  However, at high‐latitude small‐bats‐in‐summer face a particular challenge: as nocturnal foragers, they rely on the darkness at night to avoid predators and/or interspecific competition, but live in an environment with short, light summer nights, and even a lack of true night at the northernmost distributions of some bat species.\n                \n                \n                  To predict optimal behaviour in relation to latitudinal variation in diurnal cycles, we constructed a stochastic dynamic programming model of bats living at high latitudes. Using a stochastic dynamic programming framework with values that are representative for our study system, we show that individual energetic reserves are a strong driver of daytime use of torpor and night‐time foraging behaviour alike, with these linked effects being both temperature‐ and photoperiod‐dependent.\n                \n                \n                  We further used the model to predict survival probabilities at five locations across a latitudinal gradient (60.1° N to 70.9° N), finding that combinations of photoperiod and temperature conditions limited population distributions in the model.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    To verify our model results, we compared predictions for optimal decisions with our own empirical data collected on northern bats (\n                    Eptesicus nilssonii\n                    ) from two latitudes in Norway. The similarities between our predictions and observations provide strong evidence that this model framework incorporates the most important drivers of diurnal decision‐making in bat physiology and behaviour.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Comparing empirical data and model predictions also revealed that bats facing lighter night conditions further north restrict their mass gain, which strengthens the hypothesis that predation threat is a main driver of bat nocturnality. Our model findings regarding state‐dependent decisions in bats should contribute to the understanding of how bats cope with the summer challenges at high latitudes.",

Since first observed in the winter of 2007, WNS has led to unprecedented mortality in several species of bats and may threaten more than 15 additional hibernating bat species if it continues across the continent. Although the exact means by which fungal infection causes mortality are undetermined, available evidence suggests a strong role of winter environmental conditions in disease mortality.\n            \n            \n              2.\n               By 2010, the fungus\n              G. destructans\n              was detected in new areas of North America far from the area it was first observed, as well as in eight European bat species in different countries, yet mortality was not observed in many of these new areas of North America or in any part of Europe. This could be because of the differences in the fungus, rates of disease progression and/or in life‐history or physiological traits of the affected bat species between different regions. Infection of bats by\n              G. destructans\n              without associated mortality might also suggest that certain environmental conditions might have to co‐occur with fungal infection to cause mortality.\n            \n            \n              3.\n               We tested the environmental conditions hypothesis using Maxent to map and model landscape surface conditions associated with WNS mortality. This approach was unique in that we modelled possible requisite environmental conditions for disease mortality and not simply the presence of the causative agent.\n            \n            \n              4.\n               The top predictors of WNS mortality were land use/land cover types, mean air temperature of wettest quarter, elevation, frequency of precipitation and annual temperature range. Model results suggest that WNS mortality is most likely to occur in landscapes that are higher in elevation and topographically heterogeneous, drier and colder during winter, and more seasonally variable than surrounding landscapes.\n            \n            \n              5.\n               \n              Synthesis and applications\n              . This study mapped the most likely environmental surface conditions associated with bat mortality owing to WNS in the north‐eastern United Sates; maps can be used for selection of priority monitoring sites. Our results provide a starting point from which to investigate and predict the potential spread and population impacts of this catastrophic emerging disease.\n            \n          , \n            This study mapped the most likely environmental surface conditions associated with bat mortality owing to WNS in the north‐eastern United Sates; maps can be used for selection of priority monitoring sites.

The loss of habitat structures has a detrimental effect on biodiversity and affects bat species that depend on vegetation structures for foraging and commuting.\n                \n                \n                  We investigated the impact of connectivity and configuration of structural landscape elements on flight activity, species richness and diversity of insectivorous bats and distinguished three bat guilds according to species‐specific bioacoustic characteristics. We tested whether bats with shorter‐range echolocation were more sensitive to habitat fragmentation than bats with longer‐range echolocation. We expected to find different connectivity thresholds for the three guilds and hypothesized that bats prefer linear over patchy landscape elements.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Bat activity was quantified using repeated acoustic monitoring in 225 locations at 15 study plots distributed across the Swiss Central Plateau, where connectivity and the shape of landscape elements were determined by spatial analysis (\n                    GIS\n                    ). Spectrograms of bat calls were assigned to species with the software\n                    batit\n                    by means of image recognition and statistical classification algorithms.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Bat activity was significantly higher around landscape elements compared to open control areas. Short‐ and long‐range echolocating bats were more active in well‐connected landscapes, but optimal connectivity levels differed between the guilds. Species richness increased significantly with connectivity, while species diversity did not (Shannon's diversity index). Total bat activity was unaffected by the shape of landscape elements.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . This study highlights the importance of connectivity in farmland landscapes for bats, with shorter‐range echolocating bats being particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation. More structurally diverse landscape elements are likely to reduce population declines of bats and could improve conditions for other declining species, including birds. Activity was highest around optimal values of connectivity, which must be evaluated for the different guilds and spatially targeted for a region's habitat configuration. In a multi‐species approach, we recommend the reintroduction of structural elements to increase habitat heterogeneity should become part of agri‐environment schemes.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            This study highlights the importance of connectivity in farmland landscapes for bats, with shorter‐range echolocating bats being particularly sensitive to habitat fragmentation.

This study uses phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate which functional traits of bat species are correlated with their vulnerability to fragmentation in a tropical landscape with low fragment–matrix contrast.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Bats were captured over two years in eight forest fragments, nine control sites in continuous forest, and in the secondary forest matrix at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, Central Amazon, Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that there is a significant relationship between species functional traits, environmental gradients (continuous forest and fragment interiors, edges and matrix) and patterns of species distribution using phylogenetic generalized least squares (\n                    PGLS\n                    ) models, as well as a combination of\n                    RLQ\n                    and fourth‐corner analyses.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Mobility, body mass, wing morphology, and trophic level were the most important traits linked to fragmentation sensitivity based on the\n                    PGLS\n                    analysis, while body mass and trophic level emerged as the best predictors in the fourth‐corner analysis. These last two traits were correlated with the loss of continuous forest characteristics, such as high‐stature trees and forest cover.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Many animalivorous bat species rarely persist in small fragments (<100 ha) and in the secondary forest matrix, reflecting strong effects of trait‐mediated environmental filters that selectively benefit the smaller and phytophagous species.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Functional traits of species and environmental variables jointly predict local variation in patterns of bat occupancy and abundance in fragmented tropical landscapes. To minimize local extinctions, we recommend increasing habitat availability and enhancing structural and functional connectivity at the landscape scale through the creation, restoration and maintenance of corridors and stepping stones. These measures should be coupled with improving matrix quality by promoting secondary forest regeneration and persistence to effectively reduce fragment–matrix contrast.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Functional traits of species and environmental variables jointly predict local variation in patterns of bat occupancy and abundance in fragmented tropical landscapes.

Increased urbanization manifests in a number of ways and sophisticated analyses of how species respond to urban environments are required before generalizations about the relative merits of either planning strategy should be made.\n                \n                \n                  We investigated how insectivorous bats respond to housing density (a measure of urbanization intensity) and a range of habitat variables by modelling the occupancy and activity of 12 species in Melbourne, Australia. In addition to species‐level analyses, species were grouped into guilds (‘matrix’, ‘patch’ or ‘edge’ species) depending on their ecomorphology and level of patch‐dependency.\n                \n                \n                  Housing density (dwellings per hectare: dph) was the dominant explanatory variable of occupancy and activity of most species studied. Site occupancy probabilities of patch and edge species were reduced by half at housing densities of just 1·1–4·5 dph depending on species, while their activity was halved at housing densities of 2·6–10·3 dph. The activity of two matrix species also declined, but at higher housing densities (reducing by half at 4·5–7·9 dph). Patch and edge species responded nonlinearly to tree cover at low housing densities, with peaks in occupancy and activity at 20–60%. This response broke down at medium housing densities, however, as most species were no longer present.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Occupancy probability and activity of almost all bat species studied were substantially reduced even at very low housing densities. Increasing tree cover had no positive effect on the occupancy and activity of patch and edge species once medium housing densities were reached. In order for land‐sharing strategies to provide good habitat for patch and edge bat species housing densities would need to be so low as to be impractical in most urban planning contexts. By contrast, land‐sparing with forested habitat remaining in 20% or more of the landscape could provide positive conservation outcomes for the species modelled here.

Ants, birds and bats in particular can reduce herbivore numbers and thereby increase crop yield.

Bird exclusion impaired yield (from 400 to 250 kg ha\n                    −1\n                     year\n                    −1\n                    ) at 60% and enhanced yield (from 600 to 900 kg ha\n                    −1\n                     year\n                    −1\n                    ) at 15% canopy cover, while bats had no effect. Yield increased with forest proximity, a pattern not related to predator access.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  No interactive effects among predator exclusions on yield, pest damage and arthropod communities were found. Ant exclusion increased numbers of herbivores below 30% canopy cover, without reducing spider abundances. Bird exclusion reduced herbivore and increased spider abundances.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Using exclusion studies, we estimated that ants and birds cause cacao yield to vary between 100 and 800 kg ha\n                    −1\n                     year\n                    −1\n                    , depending on shade‐tree management. In all but the most shaded agroforests, ants were pivotal in supporting yields. Yields under low‐canopy cover were strongly dependent on access by predator groups, with birds reducing rather than increasing yield. Hence, cacao farmers should refrain from disturbing ant communities and maintain 30–40% shade‐tree canopy cover not only for ecophysiological reasons but also to buffer variability in predator communities.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            \n              Using exclusion studies, we estimated that ants and birds cause cacao yield to vary between 100 and 800 kg ha\n              −1\n               year\n              −1\n              , depending on shade‐tree management.

However, effective disease control in wildlife is challenging because feasible management options are often lacking. White‐nose syndrome (\n                    WNS\n                    ) is an infectious disease of hibernating bats that currently threatens several North American species with extinction. Currently, no effective treatments exist for\n                    WNS\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We conducted a laboratory experiment to test the efficacy of probiotic treatment with\n                    Pseudomonas fluorescens\n                    , a bacterium that naturally occurs on bats, to reduce disease severity and improve survival of little brown bats\n                    Myotis lucifugus\n                    exposed to\n                    Pseudogymnoascus destructans\n                    , the fungal pathogen that causes\n                    WNS\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We found that application of the probiotic bacteria at the time of fungal infection reduced several measures of disease severity and increased survival, whereas bacterial treatment prior to pathogen exposure had no effect on survival and worsened disease severity.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    .

Habitat fragmentation affects bats during their daily movements between roosts and foraging areas. As bats are protected in Europe, developers must implement specific mitigation measures that are hierarchically structured to achieve a null net impact. However, very few specific mitigation measures have been undertaken specifically for bats. Bat overpasses (e.g. gantries) are among proposed improvements intended to reduce the impact of roads, but they have rarely been tested. The effectiveness of overpasses in facilitating safe road crossing of bats is critical for justifying the implementation of this mitigation measure. We therefore assessed whether bat overpasses are effectively used by bats.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We studied three bat overpasses with different designs in France. We developed an innovative method to characterize bat crossings using acoustic flight path reconstruction (\n                    AFPR\n                    ). We used six pairs of stereo acoustic recorders in different habitat types that were located on both sides of the road, and operated simultaneously throughout the night.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Recording data contained 57,941 bat passes and 284 bat crossings from six species of bats at the three study sites. Our results suggest that crossings are more numerous if an overpass is located where bat commuting routes have been identified by environmental impact assessment. However, we found that the proportion of bat crossings along the commuting route was the same with or without an overpass; thus highlighting that bat overpasses do not fully restore habitat connectivity.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Our study demonstrates that acoustic flight path reconstruction (\n                    AFPR\n                    ) is a useful approach to obtain information on bat flight behaviour. We also emphasize the importance of field testing the effectiveness of mitigation measures, such as those intended to offset the impact of roads on biodiversity, and highlight that such measures should not be implemented based on their theoretical effectiveness alone.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Résumé\n            \n              \n                \n                  Les routes ont de nombreux effets négatifs sur la faune, y compris leur rôle dans la fragmentation des habitats. La fragmentation des habitats affecte les chauves‐souris au cours de leurs déplacements journaliers entre leur gîte et leurs zones d'alimentation. Les chauves‐souris étant protégées en Europe, les aménageurs doivent mettre en œuvre des mesures de réduction des impacts afin d'obtenir un impact net nul. Cependant, peu de ces mesures sont dédiées aux chauves‐souris. Les chiroptéroducs figurent dans ces mesures et visent à réduire l'impact des routes, mais ils ont rarement été testés. Mesurer leur efficacité pour faciliter la traversée des chauves‐souris en toute sécurité au‐dessus de la route est essentielle pour justifier leur mise en œuvre. Nous avons donc évalué si les chiroptéroducs sont utilisés par les chauves‐souris.\n                \n                \n                  Nous avons étudié trois chiroptéroducs au design différents en France et avons développé une méthode innovante pour caractériser les franchissements de chauves‐souris en les localisant grâce à leurs cris d’écholocation. Nous avons utilisé six paires d'enregistreurs stéréo acoustiques dans différents types d'habitat situés des deux côtés de la route enregistrant simultanément toute la nuit.\n                \n                \n                  Les enregistrements ont permit d'obtenir 57 941 séquences de chauves‐souris et 284 traversées de chauves‐souris pour six espèces sur les trois sites d’étude. Nos résultats suggèrent que les franchissements de chauves‐souris sont plus nombreux si un chiroptéroduc est situé là où ont été identifiés les corridors lors de l’évaluation environnementale. Cependant, nous avons constaté que la proportion de franchissement de chauves‐souris le long du corridor était la même avec ou sans chiroptéroduc ; soulignant ainsi que les chiroptéroducs ne restaurent pas complètement la connectivité des habitats.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthèse et applications\n                    . Notre étude démontre que la reconstruction des trajectoires de vol de chauves‐souris en acoustique est une bonne approche pour obtenir des informations sur leur comportement de vol. Nous soulignons également l'importance de tester sur le terrain l'efficacité des mesures de réduction, telles que celles visant à compenser l'impact des routes sur la biodiversité, et soulignons que de telles mesures ne devraient pas être mises en œuvre uniquement sur la base de leur efficacité théorique.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            \n              Our study demonstrates that acoustic flight path reconstruction (\n              AFPR\n              ) is a useful approach to obtain information on bat flight behaviour.

However, the importance of bats as pollinators has been overlooked, with a consequent lack of knowledge of the reliance of crops on bats for harvest yield and quality.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We used exclusion experiments to determine the effect of different pollinator taxa on the yield and quality of pitayas (fruit of\n                    Stenocereus queretaroensis\n                    (F.A.C. Weber) Buxbaum), a major crop in central Mexico. We studied the three most economically important cultivars and wild individuals in the principal region for pitaya production. For each pollinator taxon we recorded fruit set and measured three key parameters of fruit quality: weight, sucrose concentration and seed set. We placed camera traps to determine pollinator identity and the effect of visitation rate on fruit quality.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We found the primary pollinators of pitayas to be nectarivorous bats in the genus\n                    Leptonycteris\n                    . When bats were excluded from flowers and flowers were pollinated by other taxa (i.e. diurnal birds and insects), pitaya yield decreased by 35%, though pollination dependence varied between cultivars. Fruit quality decreased significantly in the absence of bat pollination across all cultivars, with fruits 46% lighter and 13% less sweet when pollinated by other taxa; reducing economic value, as size determines market price. Additionally, seed set (an indicator of effective pollination) was significantly lower in the absence of bat pollinators. Visitation rate had no effect on fruit quality.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications.\n                    Our study shows that bats provide a vital ecosystem service by pollinating a crop of major socio‐economic importance, and that consideration of both crop quality and yield are essential to fully understanding the benefits of bat pollination. A reduction of this service would result in a decrease in both the size and quality of the harvest, causing substantial loss of income for rural communities. Bats world‐wide face many threats, and management efforts targeted to the enhancement of wild bat pollinator populations would preserve the sustainability of both bat‐pollinated crops and wild plants.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Resumen\n            \n              \n                \n                  Los murciélagos polinizan un gran número de plantas de gran valor socioeconómico, incluyendo la mayoría de los cactus columnares (Cactaceae) en México, los cuales han sido utilizados por los humanos durante miles de años para obtener alimento y materiales. Sin embargo, se ha pasado por alto la importancia de los murciélagos como polinizadores, con la consiguiente falta de conocimiento de la dependencia de los cultivos a la polinización por los murciélagos para el rendimiento y calidad de la cosecha.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Utilizamos experimentos de exclusión para determinar el efecto de diferentes taxones polinizadores en el rendimiento y la calidad de las pitayas (fruto de\n                    Stenocereus queretaroensis\n                    (F.A.C. Weber) Buxbaum), un cultivo importante en el centro de México. Estudiamos los tres cultivares más importantes económicamente e individuos silvestres, en una de las regiones más importantes para la producción de pitaya. Para cada taxón polinizador registramos la producción de frutas y medimos tres parámetros clave de la calidad del fruto: peso, concentración de sacarosa y cantidad de semillas. Colocamos cámaras trampa para determinar la identidad de los polinizadores y el efecto de la tasa de visitas en la calidad de la fruta.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Encontramos que los principales polinizadores de las pitayas son los murciélagos nectarívoros del género\n                    Leptonycteris\n                    . Cuando los murciélagos fueron excluidos de las flores y éstas fueron polinizadas por otros taxones (es decir, aves e insectos diurnos), el rendimiento de las pitayas disminuyó en un 35%, aunque esta dependencia de polinización varió entre los cultivares. La calidad de la fruta disminuyó significativamente en ausencia de la polinización de murciélagos en todos los cultivares, con frutas 46% más livianas y 13% menos dulces cuando se polinizaron por otros taxones, reduciendo así el valor económico ya que su tamaño determina su precio en el mercado. Adicionalmente, el número de semillas (un indicador de polinización efectiva) fue significativamente menor en ausencia de los murciélagos polinizadores. La tasa de visitas no tuvo efecto sobre la calidad del fruto.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Síntesis y aplicaciones.\n                    Este estudio muestra que los murciélagos proporcionan un servicio ecosistémico vital al polinizar un cultivo de gran importancia socioeconómica, y que la consideración de la calidad y el rendimiento del cultivo son esenciales para comprender completamente los beneficios de la polinización de los murciélagos. Una reducción de este servicio resultaría en una disminución tanto en el tamaño como en la calidad de la cosecha, causando una pérdida sustancial de ingresos para las comunidades rurales. Los murciélagos en todo el mundo enfrentan muchas amenazas y los esfuerzos de manejo dirigidos a la mejora de las poblaciones de murciélagos polinizadores apoyarían a la conservación tanto de los cultivos polinizados por murciélagos como de las plantas silvestres.",

This can offer several benefits over traditional monitoring practices as it is a cost‐effective, large‐scale approach capable of providing long time series data and raising public environmental awareness. Whilst there is a debate about the quality of citizen science data, a standardised sampling design can allow citizen science data to be of a similar quality to those collected by professionals. However, many programmes use subjective, opportunistic selection of monitoring sites and this introduces several types of bias, which are not well understood.\n                \n                \n                  Using bat roost counts as a case study, we took a ‘virtual ecologist’ approach to simulate the effect of opportunistic site selection and uneven observer retention on our ability to accurately detect abundance trends. We simulated populations with different levels of temporal variability and site fidelity.\n                \n                \n                  Our simulations reveal that opportunistic site selection and low observer retention can result in biased trends and that these biases are magnified when monitored populations exhibit high levels of inter‐annual variation and low site fidelity. These results show that the synergistic effects of observer behaviour, site selection, and population dynamics lead to biased abundance trends in monitoring programmes.\n                \n                \n                  This study highlights the value of engaging and retaining citizen science observers, a standardised sampling design, and the collection of metadata. We conclude that monitoring programmes need to be aware of their focal species' temporal variability and site fidelity to adequately assess the potential bias caused by opportunistic site selection and low observer retention.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Accurate data on population changes are key for conservation success. Therefore, it is important that citizen science monitoring programmes assess and potentially quantify the biases present in their data. We demonstrate the applicability of an established simulation framework to assess the effect of biases on our ability to correctly detect abundance trends. Our findings highlight that monitoring programmes need to be aware of their study species’ temporal variability and site fidelity to assess and account for the effects of biased site selection and observer retention.",

Targeted agri‐environment schemes (AESs) to enhance populations of threatened species inhabiting farmland have been proposed for this purpose, yet their effectiveness for nocturnal wildlife remains unknown.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We assessed whether hedgerow management prescribed by targeted AESs to improve habitat conditions for the greater horseshoe bat (\n                    Rhinolophus ferrumequinum\n                    ) in England may positively influence the species, the entire bat assemblage and the insect prey of bats. We specifically investigated the responses of bats (occurrence, activity and species richness) and insects (biomass, abundance and diversity) to time since last trimming (from 1 up to 10 years). We explored the mechanisms underlying the effects of AES via changes in trimming regime on bats. Moreover, we investigated the effects of landscape context on bats as we expected that highly mobile species would benefit further from landscape‐scale management.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Bat species richness significantly increased with time since last trimming. Three bat taxa of major conservation concern in Western Europe substantially benefited from the targeted prescription, namely\n                    R. ferrumequinum\n                    ,\n                    Rhinolophus hipposideros\n                    and\n                    Plecotus\n                    spp. Insect family richness and dipteran abundance were also significantly greater at hedgerows that were untrimmed for at least 3 years. The activity of more common bat species (i.e. pipistrelle bats) was not influenced by time since last trimming.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Changes in trimming regime strongly affected hedgerow height which directly and indirectly (by increasing prey abundance) influenced bat occurrence, activity and species richness along hedgerows.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    The activity of highly mobile bat species was mainly associated with a range of landscape attributes. The amount of semi‐natural grassland within 0.5 km of the sampling sites positively influenced\n                    R. ferrumequinum\n                    while the presence of urban areas negatively affected light‐sensitive bat species.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications.\n                    The implementation of targeted agri‐environment schemes can include effective measures to enhance bats and their insect prey in farmland. Although we highlight the success of current prescriptions on hedgerow management, we suggest that their effectiveness can easily be optimized by encouraging farmers to keep hedgerows untrimmed for longer periods (>3 up to 10 years).

We modelled scenarios altering three parameters: (a) WNS severity (population growth rate of WNS‐affected populations;\n                    λ\n                    WNS\n                    ); (b) proportion of population treated; and (c) treatment improvement in winter survival (TIWS).\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Our models predict that a treatment or management action that targets an entire population with a TIWS of 40% (the average TIWS in bat trials to date) will cause a population to stabilize or increase if WNS causes an annual decline of less than 70% (i.e.\n                    λ\n                    WNS\n                     > 0.30). However, for severe WNS (\n                    λ\n                    WNS\n                     = 0.10), the TIWS must be at least 54% to cause a population to stabilize or increase. Where only a proportion of a WNS‐affected population is treated, population stability is much harder to achieve unless the impact of WNS attenuates over time.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Our models suggest that a treatment or management action only facilitates the recovery of WNS-affected populations if WNS is mild, TIWS is high, and a large proportion of the population can be treated. If a small proportion of the population is treated, it is easier to facilitate recovery if WNS severity attenuates over time.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications.\n                    We modelled the predicted abundance trajectory of white‐nose syndrome‐affected little brown myotis\n                    Myotis lucifugus\n                    populations in response to a hypothetical treatment or management action. Our two types of models incorporate the complete range of possible scenarios varying three parameters: (a) population growth rate of the white‐nose syndrome‐affected population, (b) the improvement in winter survival associated with the treatment or management action, and (c) the proportion of the population treated. We suggest that our models, which can be explored using online Shiny applications, should be used in the planning phase of treatment or management action programmes for white‐nose syndrome.",

However, despite the importance of regenerating forests in mitigating the pervasive negative consequences of forest loss and fragmentation on forest‐associated biodiversity, longitudinal studies on species' phylogenetic responses to matrix regeneration are rare.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We surveyed bats in continuous primary forest, primary forest fragments and in the regenerating secondary forest matrix of a whole‐ecosystem Amazonian fragmentation experiment, ~15 and ~30 years after forest clearance, to investigate how changes in matrix quality through forest recovery affect phylogenetic\n                    α\n                    ‐ and\n                    β\n                    ‐diversity.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We found that temporal changes in phylogenetic\n                    α\n                    ‐richness were more marked in the secondary forest matrix than in forest fragments and continuous forest, evidencing a significant increase in total evolutionary history over time. However, when the effects of species richness were accounted for, the phylogenetic structure of each assemblage was reduced close to zero, evincing a random pattern of lineages in all habitat types. Temporal differences in phylogenetic\n                    β\n                    ‐diversity were driven mainly by\n                    β\n                    replacement\n                    in secondary forest and continuous forest ~30 years after forest clearance. Both habitats also clustered together in terms of\n                    β\n                    richness\n                    , indicating similar levels of evolutionary heritage. Consequently, regenerating secondary forest showed a reduction in the extinction probability of lineages over time.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Approximately 30 years of secondary forest regeneration were sufficient for phylogenetic richness to recover to levels similar to those observed in continuous forest. Promoting forest succession on degraded land through a combination of natural and active restoration, while ensuring the long‐term protection of secondary forests regardless of their age, is of key importance for conserving tropical bat diversity and their associated ecosystem services. Such restoration measures would stimulate the recolonization of fragments and matrix habitats by evolutionarily distinct bat species, safeguarding phylogenetically diverse assemblages and ecological functions. Our study suggests that forest restoration in tropical degraded areas should be encouraged and secondary forests be protected by law, especially in countryside ecosystems with high primary forest cover, and in the surroundings of protected areas.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Resumen\n            \n              \n                \n                  A lo largo de los trópicos, los bosques secundarios en regeneración ocupan vastas áreas previamente taladas para actividades agrícolas y ganaderas. Sin embargo, a pesar de la importancia de la regeneración de los bosques para mitigar las consecuencias negativas causadas por la pérdida y fragmentación de los bosques en la biodiversidad, los estudios longitudinales sobre las respuestas filogenéticas de las especies a la regeneración de la matriz son escasos.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Muestreamos murciélagos en bosque primario continuo, fragmentos de bosque primario y en la matriz con bosque secundario en regeneración en un experimento de fragmentación a escala de ecosistema en la Amazonia, aproximadamente 15 y 30 años después de la tala del bosque, para investigar cómo los cambios en la calidad de la matriz a través de la recuperación del bosque afectan la diversidad filogenética\n                    α\n                    y\n                    β\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Encontramos que los cambios temporales en la riqueza filogenética\n                    α\n                    fueron más marcados en la matriz con bosque secundario que en los fragmentos de bosque y en el bosque continuo, evidenciando un aumento significativo en la historia evolutiva total a lo largo del tiempo. Sin embargo, cuando se tomaron en cuenta los efectos de la riqueza de especies, la estructura filogenética de cada conjunto se redujo casi a cero, lo que evidencia un patrón aleatorio de linajes en todos los tipos de hábitats. Las diferencias temporales en la diversidad filogenética\n                    β\n                    fueron impulsadas principalmente por el reemplazo\n                    β\n                    en el bosque secundario y el bosque continuo aproximadamente 30 años después de la tala del bosque. Estos dos hábitats también se agruparon en términos de riqueza\n                    β\n                    , lo que indica niveles similares de herencia evolutiva. En consecuencia, la regeneración del bosque secundario mostró una reducción en la probabilidad de extinción de linajes a lo largo del tiempo.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Síntesis y aplicaciones\n                    . Aproximadamente 30 años de regeneración del bosque secundario fueron suficientes para que la riqueza filogenética se recuperara a niveles similares a los observados en el bosque continuo. Promover la sucesión de bosques en tierras degradadas mediante una combinación de restauración natural y activa, al mismo tiempo que se garantiza la protección a largo plazo de los bosques secundarios, independientemente de su edad, es de importancia clave para la conservación de la diversidad de murciélagos tropicales y sus servicios ecosistémicos asociados. Tales medidas de restauración estimularían la recolonización de fragmentos y hábitats de matriz por especies de murciélagos evolutivamente distintas, salvaguardando conjuntos filogenéticamente diversos y funciones ecológicas. Nuestro estudio sugiere que se debe fomentar la restauración de bosques en áreas tropicales degradadas y que los bosques secundarios deben ser protegidos por ley, especialmente en ecosistemas rurales con alta cobertura forestal primaria y en los alrededores de áreas protegidas.",

We specifically investigated whether the transition period prior to full organic certification influenced bat activity with a special focus on any moderation effects from surrounding semi‐natural areas.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    The activity of three (\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii, Hypsugo savii\n                    and\n                    Miniopterus schreibersii\n                    ) of four bat species was significantly lower in farms undergoing the transitional period than in conventional farms, and\n                    P. kuhlii and H. savii\n                    were significantly less active in organic transitional farming systems that in organic‐certified ones. Furthermore, the activity of the most dominant species (\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    ) was significantly higher on organic than transitional and conventional citrus orchards, thus suggesting a time‐lag effect. Landscape complexity measured as the amount of semi‐natural areas did not moderate the effects of farming system for any study species.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and application\n                    . The transition to organic farming had persistent detrimental effects on bats and potentially on the pest suppression services they provide. Future agri‐environmental policy should consider the transition period and implement measures to mitigate any negative effects on biodiversity, alongside promoting asynchronous transition of nearby farms. Our findings further highlight the crucial need to consider the time since transition to organic farming when assessing potential benefits of organic management on biodiversity.",

As treatment application is scaled up, predicting responses at the population level will help in the development of management plans.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We develop a model allowing for the implementation of multiple treatment scenarios in bat populations at risk of severe mortality from white‐nose syndrome. Our model allows for variation in over 10 parameters, including effectiveness of treatment, treatment‐related disturbance, number of individuals treated, number of hibernacula treated, herd immunity and movement among hibernacula. Additionally, the model allows treatments to be applied to individuals, the hibernaculum or a combination of the two. We simulated treatments for populations of 1000, 10,000 and 100,000 individuals, with the distribution of individuals within hibernacula based on field surveys of\n                    Myotis lucifugus\n                    .\n                  \n                \n                \n                  When treatments are applied to individuals, we found that treatment success was most influenced by the number of bats effectively treated, the magnitude of disturbance and the year of first treatment relative to initial mortality. For treatments applied to hibernacula, we found year of first treatment relative to initial mortality, magnitude of disturbance and effectiveness of treatment to be the best predictors of success.\n                \n                \n                  Treatments have the potential to mitigate white‐nose syndrome‐related mortality, but application of treatments after initial mass mortality seems to be of limited benefit. Unknowns surrounding influential treatment parameters, such as disturbance to hibernating bats, created substantial variation across outcomes and highlight the importance of obtaining field estimates of parameters associated with treatments.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    : While treatment applications can increase survival from white‐nose syndrome, their potential is strongly diminished when not applied before or during the early epidemic stages. Once the disease is established, increasing survival and reproduction through methods other than disease treatments could be a better option. In the United States, most areas yet to reach the late epidemic or established stage are in the west where bats do not aggregate in large colonies and treating a substantial number of individuals will be difficult.",
