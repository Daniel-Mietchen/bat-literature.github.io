All the algorithm-database combinations can be executed with default parameters or with customized settings, and the results can be viewed in a variety of ways. A new online resource, the BLAST Program Selection Guide, has been created to assist in the definition of search strategies. This article discusses optimal search strategies and highlights some BLAST features that can make your searches more powerful.",

To clarify the possible contribution of BAT thermogenesis to whole body febrile response, we investigated febrile and thermogenic response to IL-1beta using mice deficient in uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), a key molecule for BAT thermogenesis. In wild-type (WT) mice, IL-1beta injection (5 microg/kg ip) increased body temperature (+1.82 degrees C at 20 min), decreased physical activity (-37% at 1 h), and produced a slight and insignificant rise (+15% at 1 h) in oxygen consumption (Vo(2)). Vo(2) dependent on metabolic thermogenesis (DeltaVO2 thermogenesis) calculated by correcting the effect of physical activity was increased after IL-1beta injection (726 +/- 200 ml x h(-1) x kg(-1) at 1 h). Almost the same responses were observed in UCP1-deficient mice, showing 638 +/- 87 ml x h(-1) x kg(-1) of DeltaVO2 thermogenesis at 1 h. In contrast, CL316,243, a selective activator of BAT thermogenesis, increased body temperature, decreased physical activity, and produced a significant rise in Vo2 in WT mice, showing 1,229 +/- 35 ml x h(-1) x kg(-1) of DeltaVO2 thermogenesis at 1 h. These changes were not observed in UCP1-deficient mice. These results, conflicting with a previously proposed idea of a role of BAT in fever, suggest a minor contribution of BAT thermogenesis to IL-1beta-induced fever. In support of this, we found no effect of IL-1beta on triglyceride content and UCP1 mRNA level in BAT, in contrast with apparent effects of CL316,243.",

            "abstractNote": "The polymorphic fungus Candida albicans is a member of the normal human microbiome. In most individuals, C. albicans resides as a lifelong, harmless commensal. Under certain circumstances, however, C. albicans can cause infections that range from superficial infections of the skin to life-threatening systemic infections. Several factors and activities have been identified which contribute to the pathogenic potential of this fungus. Among them are molecules which mediate adhesion to and invasion into host cells, the secretion of hydrolases, the yeast-to-hypha transition, contact sensing and thigmotropism, biofilm formation, phenotypic switching and a range of fitness attributes. Our understanding of when and how these mechanisms and factors contribute to infection has significantly increased during the last years. In addition, novel virulence mechanisms have recently been discovered. In this review we present an update on our current understanding of the pathogenicity mechanisms of this important human pathogen.",

            "abstractNote": "Candida albicans is the most common cause of invasive fungal infections in humans. It is unclear how C. albicans escapes from phagocytic attack and survives in the hostile blood environment during life-threatening systemic infections. Using a conditional overexpression or suppression genetic strategy, we discovered that HYR1 gene reduced phagocytic killing activity of C. albicans in vitro and increased tissue fungal burden in vivo. Concordant with its positive regulation by the transcription factor Bcr1p, autonomous expression of HYR1 complemented the hypersusceptibility to phagocyte-mediated killing of a bcr1 null mutant of C. albicans in vitro. As for C. albicans, heterologous expression of HYR1 in Candida glabrata rendered the organism more resistant to neutrophil killing activity. Vaccination with a recombinant Hyr1p significantly protected mice against hematogenously disseminated candidiasis (P = .001). Finally, anti-rHyr1p polyclonal antibodies enhanced mouse neutrophil killing activity by directly neutralizing rHyr1p effects in vitro. Thus, Hyr1 is an important virulence factor for C. albicans, mediating resistance to phagocyte killing. Hyr1p is a promising target for vaccine or other immunological or small molecule intervention to improve the outcomes of disseminated candidiasis.",

Acute rejection is ablated with therapeutic doses of the calcineurin inhibitor Cyclosporine A (CyA). In this way we successfully mimic human disease. Using this model we have demonstrated, with cell transfer models using highly purified T cell populations, that calcineurin inhibitors ablate CD4+ T cell effector mechanisms. As such, in the presence of calcineurin inhibition, graft vasculopathy is dependent on CD8+ T cell effector mechanisms. In this study we examine the etiology of graft vasculopathy by these CD8+ T cells in the presence of calcineurin inhibition. We transferred CD8+ T cells from CyA treated IFN-?? deficient mice into immunodeficient mouse recipients of aortic allografts to demonstrate that IFN-?? production by CD8+ T cells is essential for the development of AV in the presence of calcineurin inhibition. Using two models of CTL ablation we also demonstrated that CTL activity by CD8+ T cells is essential for the development of AV in the presence of calcineurin inhibition. This is in contrast to models without calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppression where either pathway is capable, by itself, of inducing AV. These data indicate that although calcineurin inhibition ablates CD4+ T cell effects and weakens CD8+ T cell pathways, the antigenic challenge of the graft is enough to induce sufficient responsiveness from CD8+ T cells to induce robust AV. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

            "abstractNote": "Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.\nAvailability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).\nContact: mrobinson@wehi.edu.au",

            "abstractNote": "It has been difficult to perform cytokine studies for many wildlife and nontraditional species because of a lack of immunologic reagents at the protein level. Recently, simple and rapid assays for quantifying mRNA expression by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have been used for analysis of cytokine profiles in humans and other mammalian species. This report describes the development and application of real time RT-PCR to measure the expression of several important elk (Cervus elaphus) cytokine mRNAs, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12p40, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and the enzyme-inducible nitric oxide synthase, all of which are involved in immune responses and regulation. For the broadest potential application of the assay, primers and probes were designed using consensus sequences from several species of interest. To obtain standardized quantitative results, external controls consisting of a DNA template for each target gene were used to generate linear standard curves over a 6 to 8 log range with detection of as few as 10 copies of amplicon per reaction. Sample-to-sample variation in the efficiency of the RT, as well as in the quantity and quality of the starting RNA, was compensated for by normalizing the results to the endogenous housekeeping gene beta(2)-microglobulin. The assay was evaluated by monitoring the kinetics of cytokine mRNA synthesis induced by mitogenic and antigenic stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Mycobacterium bovis-infected elk. Concanavalin A-stimulated PBMCs demonstrated a rapid but transient increase in cytokine mRNA expression following in vitro mitogenic activation with optimal mRNA induction observed after 4 to 16 hr. The PBMCs stimulated with the mycobacterial recall antigen, bovine-purified protein derivative (PPD-bovis), demonstrated variable mRNA induction kinetics for each cytokine. Whereas PPD-bovis optimally induced IL-2 mRNA after 8 hr of in vitro stimulation, longer in vitro stimulation times were necessary for the optimal induction of IL-4 and TNF-alpha mRNA (up to 48 hr). We demonstrate real-time RT-PCR to be a rapid, sensitive, and reproducible technique, which will make it a valuable tool in the study of immunologic responses and cytokine profiles of cervids and other nontraditional livestock and wildlife species.",

            "abstractNote": "Cell wall components from Candida albicans were compared to intact cells for their ability to induce natural cytotoxic immunoeffectors in the peritoneal cavity of mice. A soluble mannoprotein extract (MP) and an insoluble glucan fraction (GG) strongly stimulated the generation of peritoneal effectors capable of lysing YAC-1 and P-815 tumour cell lines in vitro. The anti-YAC-1 effectors were characterized as natural killer (NK) lymphocytes while the anti-P-815 effectors appeared to be activated macrophages. The activity of each fraction was typically dose-dependent and both fractions differed from whole cells in the kinetics of induction of cytotoxicity. However, the NK and macrophage effectors generated by these materials had similar functional and phenotypic properties, irrespective of the material used as inducer. No mannoprotein was detected in the insoluble glucan fraction GG. Hence, the immunoenhancing activity of GG could not be attributed to the presence of some MP or MP-like component. Mannan-rich fractions with low (less than 3%) protein content (M) or extracted by hot alkaline reagent (M-alk) were inactive as NK and macrophage inducers. Thus, the cell wall of C. albicans contains at least two distinct macromolecular complexes which mediate the induction in murine peritoneal exudates of cytotoxic effectors active against tumour cell lines.",

We tested the effect of rVSV-ZEBOV in preventing Ebola virus disease in contacts and contacts of contacts of recently confirmed cases in Guinea, west Africa. METHODS: We did an open-label, cluster-randomised ring vaccination trial (Ebola ca Suffit!) in the communities of Conakry and eight surrounding prefectures in the Basse-Guinee region of Guinea, and in Tomkolili and Bombali in Sierra Leone. We assessed the efficacy of a single intramuscular dose of rVSV-ZEBOV (2x10(7) plaque-forming units administered in the deltoid muscle) in the prevention of laboratory confirmed Ebola virus disease. After confirmation of a case of Ebola virus disease, we definitively enumerated on a list a ring (cluster) of all their contacts and contacts of contacts including named contacts and contacts of contacts who were absent at the time of the trial team visit. The list was archived, then we randomly assigned clusters (1:1) to either immediate vaccination or delayed vaccination (21 days later) of all eligible individuals (eg, those aged >/=18 years and not pregnant, breastfeeding, or severely ill). An independent statistician generated the assignment sequence using block randomisation with randomly varying blocks, stratified by location (urban vs rural) and size of rings (20 individuals). Ebola response teams and laboratory workers were unaware of assignments. After a recommendation by an independent data and safety monitoring board, randomisation was stopped and immediate vaccination was also offered to children aged 6-17 years and all identified rings. The prespecified primary outcome was a laboratory confirmed case of Ebola virus disease with onset 10 days or more from randomisation. The primary analysis compared the incidence of Ebola virus disease in eligible and vaccinated individuals assigned to immediate vaccination versus eligible contacts and contacts of contacts assigned to delayed vaccination. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR201503001057193. FINDINGS: In the randomised part of the trial we identified 4539 contacts and contacts of contacts in 51 clusters randomly assigned to immediate vaccination (of whom 3232 were eligible, 2151 consented, and 2119 were immediately vaccinated) and 4557 contacts and contacts of contacts in 47 clusters randomly a…",

We report the results of an interim analysis of a trial of rVSV-ZEBOV in Guinea, west Africa. Methods For this open-label, cluster-randomised ring vaccination trial, suspected cases of Ebola virus disease in Basse-Guinée (Guinea, west Africa) were independently ascertained by Ebola response teams as part of a national surveillance system. After laboratory confirmation of a new case, clusters of all contacts and contacts of contacts were defined and randomly allocated 1:1 to immediate vaccination or delayed (21 days later) vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV (one dose of 2×10 7 plaque-forming units, administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle). Adults (age ≥18 years) who were not pregnant or breastfeeding were eligible for vaccination. Block randomisation was used, with randomly varying blocks, stratified by location (urban vs rural) and size of rings (≤20 vs >20 individuals). The study is open label and masking of participants and field teams to the time of vaccination is not possible, but Ebola response teams and laboratory workers were unaware of allocation to immediate or delayed vaccination. Taking into account the incubation period of the virus of about 10 days, the prespecified primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed Ebola virus disease with onset of symptoms at least 10 days after randomisation. The primary analysis was per protocol and compared the incidence of Ebola virus disease in eligible and vaccinated individuals in immediate vaccination clusters with the incidence in eligible individuals in delayed vaccination clusters. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR201503001057193. Findings Between April 1, 2015, and July 20, 2015, 90 clusters, with a total population of 7651 people were included in the planned interim analysis. 48 of these clusters (4123 people) were randomly assigned to immediate vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV, and 42 clusters (3528 people) were randomly assigned to delayed vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV. In the immediate vaccination group, there were no cases of Ebola virus disease with symptom onset at least 10 days after randomisation, whereas in the delayed vaccination group there were 16 cases of Ebola virus disease from seven clusters, showing a vaccine efficacy of 100% (95% CI 74·7-100·0; …",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: Hypercholesterolemia is common after cardiac transplantation and may contribute to the development of coronary vasculopathy. Pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, has been shown to be effective and safe in lowering cholesterol levels after cardiac transplantation. Cell-culture studies using inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase have suggested an immunosuppressive effect. METHODS: Early after transplantation, we randomly assigned consecutive patients to receive either pravastatin (47 patients) or no HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (50 patients). RESULTS: Twelve months after transplantation, the pravastatin group had lower mean (+/- SD) cholesterol levels than the control group (193 +/- 36 vs. 248 +/- 49 mg per deciliter, P < 0.001), less frequent cardiac rejection accompanied by hemodynamic compromise (3 vs. 14 patients, P = 0.005), better survival (94 percent vs. 78 percent, P = 0.025), and a lower incidence of coronary vasculopathy in the transplant as determined by angiography and at autopsy (3 vs. 10 patients, P = 0.049). There was no difference between the two groups in the incidence of mild or moderate episodes of cardiac rejection. In a subgroup of study patients, intracoronary ultrasound measurements at base line and one year after transplantation showed less progression in the pravastatin group in maximal intimal thickness (0.11 +/- 0.09 mm, vs. 0.23 +/- 0.16 mm in the control group; P = 0.002) and in the intimal index (0.05 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.10 +/- 0.10, P = 0.031). In a subgroup of patients, the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells was lower in the pravastatin group than in the control group (9.8 percent vs. 22.2 percent specific lysis, P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: After cardiac transplantation, pravastatin had beneficial effects on cholesterol levels, the incidence of rejection causing hemodynamic compromise, one-year survival, and the incidence of coronary vasculopathy.",

            "abstractNote": "Circulating cortisol levels are often used to assess the biological stress response in captive primates. Some methods commonly used to collect blood samples may alter the stress response. As such, noninvasive means to analyze cortisol levels are increasingly being developed. We adapted an existing collection method to simultaneously obtain saliva from multiple socially living hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas hamadryas) and validated an enzyme-immunoassay kit to quantify cortisol within the saliva samples. Over a period of 12 months, saliva samples were regularly collected from approximately half of the 18-member colony, representing younger monkeys who were more willing to participate. The assay met the four criteria typically used to assess the effectiveness of a new analytical technique: parallelism, precision, accuracy, and sensitivity. Cortisol levels were also proportional to those expected given published plasma levels of cortisol in baboons. Further, salivary cortisol levels increased in individuals following significant stress-related events, such as removal from the group, indicating biological validation. The technique provided a reliable and effective means to assess a physiological indicator of stress in a social group without initiating a stress response owing to handling or sedation, and provided a real-time assessment of cortisol levels and reactivity. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

            "abstractNote": "Human influenza subunit vaccines are not fully protective in either the very young or elderly populations where risk is greatest. The use of an adjuvant to enhance antibody titer is an attractive option to increase vaccine efficacy. A series of squalene/H2O emulsions stabilized either by the amphipathic muramyl peptide MTP-PE (sodium N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-alanyl-2-(1???,2???-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3??? phospho) ethylamide) or by mixtures of the sorbitan oleate surfactants Tween 80 and Span 85 have been tested as adjuvants with influenza vaccine. Combination of influenza vaccine with the Tween/Span stabilized emulsions has resulted in significantly higher antibody titers to vaccine in an extensive series of naive animal models. The use of submicron emulsion droplets is significant in determination of adjuvant activity while the presence of the muramyl peptide is not required for adjuvant activity. The 200-300 nm diameter emulsion formulation MF59 containing only the low toxicity components squalene, Tween 80 and Span 85 has been shown to enhance titers from 5 to 250 times that achievable with vaccine alone. ?? 1995.",

These are: (1) Duvenhage virus (gt4), isolated again in 2006 from a human fatality; (2) Mokola virus (gt3), isolated irregularly, mostly from cats; (3) Lagos bat virus (gt2) continually isolated over the past four years from Epomophorus fruit bats and from incidental terrestrial animals and (4) Rabies virus (gt1) - with two virus biotypes endemic in mongoose and in canid species (mostly domestic dogs, jackals and bat-eared foxes), respectively. Only two of these are associated with bats in Southern Africa, viz. Duvenhage virus and Lagos bat virus (gts 4 and 2). For both these genotypes the authors have embarked on a programme of comparative study of molecular epidemiology. Duvenhage virus nucleoprotein nucleotide sequence analysis indicated a very low nucleotide diversity even though isolates were isolated decades apart. In contrast, individual isolates of Lagos bat virus were found to differ significantly with respectto nucleoprotein gene nucleotide sequence diversity as well as in pathogenicity profiles.",

            "abstractNote": "During mammalian hibernation, metabolic rate can be reduced to <5% of the euthermic rate as a result of coordinated suppression of multiple energy expensive metabolic processes. Gene transcription is one of these and the present study examines mechanisms of transcriptional control that could contribute to lowering the rate of gene expression in torpor. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) have been linked to gene silencing and measured HDAC activity was 1.82-fold higher in skeletal muscle of hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Spermophilus tridecemlineatus, compared with euthermic controls. Western blotting also showed that HDAC1 and HDAC4 protein levels were 1.21-and 1.48-fold higher, respectively, in muscle from torpid animals. Histone H3 was also evaluated by Western blotting. Total histone H3 was unchanged but two forms of covalently modified histone H3 that are associated with active transcription (phosphorylated Ser 10 and acetylated Lys 23) were significantly reduced by 38-39% in muscle during hibernation. Finally, RNA polymerase II activity was measured using a PCR-based approach; activity in muscle from hibernating squirrels was only 57% of the euthermic value. These data support an overall decrease in transcriptional activity in skeletal muscle of hibernating animals that is accomplished by multiple molecular mechanisms. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Eisentraut’s more than 50 years ago. Our survey yielded a total catch of 19 species of mammals: 16 rodents, two bats, and one shrew. For each species we summarize data on natural history and discuss taxonomical and distributional aspects. We observed a difference between the rodent assemblages of the lowland (below 1000 m) (including Praomys misonnei) and the upper sub-montane and montane forest (1500–2000 m) (including Hylomyscus cf. walterverheyeni, identified for the first time from the Cameroon Mountains). This seems to correspond to previously described vegetation changes between 1000 and 1500 m. The inhabited and cultivated zones at the base of Mt. Kupe yielded eight widely-distributed rodent species. A number of taxonomical problems concerning montane forest species remain to be solved.",

Bats are among the few mammals that can regularly be found on islands around the world, yet knowledge on insular bat assemblages is often poor and anecdotal. Here we integrate diﬀerent approaches to assess the bat assemblage composition on the Mediterranean island of Pantelleria. We found that at least six species occur on the island, including two typically African taxa, thus doubling the numbers known from previous studies. We provide insights into the distribution, biogeography and conservation planning of these bat species, highlighting the importance of studying and conserving insular bat populations.",

            "abstractNote": "The Pantanal, the world’s largest alluvial ﬂoodplain, is located in the savanna biome of South America. Chiroptera is the region’s richest order of mammals, comprising approximately 40% of mammal species. Bats play here signiﬁcant ecological roles as food web connectors, and especially as pollinators and seed dispersers. In this study, we review the knowledge on the bats of Pantanal ﬂoodplain and surrounding plateaus, focusing on species composition, habitat use, feeding habits and mutualistic and antagonistic networks. Few highly abundant and unrelated species dominate the bat fauna in the ﬂoodplain, in addition to several few abundant species that occur in subregions toward their original geographical distributions out of the Pantanal. Phyllostomids show generalist diets with high overlap among them as a response to low food diversity and marked seasonality of fruit availability. Non-phyllostomids are essentially aerial insectivores associated to open habitats, contrasting with phyllostomids that predominate in forest habitats. Mutualistic networks between phyllostomids and endozoochorous plants are nested and show low specialization, whereas antagonistic networks between phyllostomids and batﬂies are modular and highly specialized in the ﬂoodplain. The central position in the continent, the recent geological history, and the extraordinary productivity maintained by seasonal ﬂoods make the Pantanal a major ecotone in South America, where species of bats from diﬀerent geographical origins overlap part of their distributions. Moreover, the number of bat species relative to area is far greater in the Pantanal than in any other South American domains, like the Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado and Amazon. Although vast pristine areas persist in the Pantanal, the ﬂoodplain is weakly protected under Brazilian laws, which raises imperative issues on the conservation of this wetland.",

            "abstractNote": "In the Mediterranean region, cryptic diversity of bats is common. As distinct genetic lineages should be managed independently for conservation, insight into bat phylogeography is important. The Maltese islands are located in the centre of the Mediterranean between North Africa and Sicily and are densely populated. At present, it is thought that at least seven species of bats are native, but phylogeographic aﬃliations remain largely unexplored. Therefore, we sequenced a ca. 540 bp fragment of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene from 23 bats, which were captured during the citizen-science project Akustika. We found two morphologically cryptic lineages common in North Africa, Plecotus gaisleri and a mainly North-African lineage of Hypsugo savii (named Hypsugo cf. darwinii in some recent studies). We also recorded two Pipistrellus species. The P. kuhlii haplotype belonged to a lineage present in North-Africa and across the Mediterranean. Within P. pipistrellus we found two novel haplotypes that clustered within a North-African clade, well distinguished from the European haplotypes. Our results highlight the historic connection between the bat fauna of the Maltese Islands and North Africa. Malta is one of the few regions in the European Union where P. gaisleri and the North-African clades of P. pipistrellus and H. savii occur. Hence, Malta has an exceptionally high responsibility for the conservation of these taxa in Europe.",

In no other deserts have such specialized nectar bat-ﬂowering plant mutualisms evolved. Three lineages of morphologically specialized phyllostomid nectar bats (Leptonycteris, Choeronycteris, and Platalina) are involved in this mutualism: the former two genera occur in Mexico, southwestern United States, and, in the case of Leptonycteris, northern South America whereas the latter genus occurs in the central Andes of South America. In this paper we describe the importance of Leptonycteris and Choeronycteris as pollinators of columnar cacti and paniculate agaves in North American deserts, discuss the evolutionary history of these interactions, and brieﬂy compare these interactions with those in other Neotropical arid regions. We point out that because of their wideranging foraging and migratory behavior Leptonycteris bats are critical for maintaining genetic connectivity among populations of their food plants. Recent phylogenetic studies indicate that nectar bats have also been an important factor behind the high diversiﬁcation rates of columnar cacti and paniculate agaves in the past 10 million years. Because of the unique ecological and evolutionary importance of these bats, their conservation should be a high priority.",

Quantifying the PM\n              2.5\n              exposure caused by each emitter type, we show that nearly all major emission categories—consistently across states, urban and rural areas, income levels, and exposure levels—contribute to the systemic PM\n              2.5\n              exposure disparity experienced by people of color.

Therefore, the four-year LIFE Nature programme \"Conservation of three cave-dwelling bats in Southern France\" included an autoecological study of Miniopterus schreibersii, a highly gregarious cave-dwelling species. In a colony of 3-5,000 adults, 21 females were radio-tracked during pregnancy and lactating periods, when some of them switched roosts within a 30 km radius around the maternity colony. Every night, for about 6 hours, each bat flew far from the roost (4.1 to 29.2 km) to forage on several small feeding areas (1 to 9 over a few nights). Mean individual home-range estimation averaged 10837 ha for pregnant females, 22318 ha for lactating females. Urban areas lighted by white street lamps were used extensively. Some bats also foraged selectively in deciduous or mixed woodlands and in orchards and parks. The importance of hedgerows was confirmed. Conservation of M. schreibersii must be planned at a large scale, protecting a network of roosts and promoting nature-friendly agricultural practices.",

Furthermore, bats have a very energy-expensive mode of locomotion: ﬂight. This high energetic demand has to be covered by food intake. The retention time of the digestive tract is one factor affecting the energy intake of bat species. Factors like energy demand, gut volume and dietary specialization inﬂuence retention time in mammals. However, maximum retention time for only Myotis myotis and transit time only for M. lucifugus, Nyctophilius gloudi and Nyctalus noctula is known. This study investigated the maximum retention times and transit times of 10 Central European bat species. It was hypothesized that the level of specialization of the digestive tract, energy-demanding processes and intestine length would affect the retention time of bats. Fluorescence-marked mealworms Tenebrio molitor were used to measure the time between the ﬁrst ingested mealworm and the ﬁrst appearance of the marker or the last ﬂuorescing feces, respectively. For the ﬁrst time, the retention time of 10 insectivorous bat species was measured to determine interspeciﬁc differences. Additionally, we measured the retention time of post-lactating female and spermatogenically active male Pipistrellus pipistrellus to determine intraspeciﬁc differences. The retention time of bats differed signiﬁcantly between species and is probably inﬂuenced by the level of specialization of the digestive tract. High-level specialization of the digestive tract resulted in short retention times. Furthermore, signiﬁcant intraspeciﬁc differences between postlactating and spermatogenically active individuals of P. pipistrellus showed that the retention time within a single species might be inﬂuenced by energy-demanding processes (e.g. reproduction).",

Here we describe the development and application of models to predict habitat use of a common insectivorous bat (Eptesicus fuscus) based upon δ13C and δ15N signatures of skin tissue. We used a 42-specimen sample collected from three well-characterized ecogeographic regions, disparate both in photosynthetic mechanism and fertilizer use, to generate the models. Significant univariate differences between these three sites in terms of δ13C (F2, 39 = 112.92, P < 0.0001) and δ15N (F2, 39 = 97.06, P < 0.0001), and multivariate significance of both variables (Wilk’s λ = 0.032, F4, 76 = 87.02, P < 0.0001), made it possible to develop three predictive models using Fisher’s linear discriminant functions: 1) a model predicting if bats forage in C3 or mixed C3/C4 sites, 2) a model predicting if bats forage in agricultural areas, and 3) a combined model using both variables to predict specific habitat use. We present the results of model application to an independent dataset of 329 bats sampled from 10 states that included a broad range of δ13C (-26.53‰ ≤ δ13C ≤ -17.20‰) and δ15N (6.36‰ ≤ δ15N ≤ 15.60‰) signatures. We validated the use of skin tissue samples (from wing membranes) in the model by comparing the sites used for model development across five tissue types, selecting skin samples for model development due to consistently low variance within this tissue type. Our results indicate nonspecific habitat-use by big brown bats.",

In contrast, ﬁlovirus isolates recently obtained from bat tissues are not distinct from previously known strains, and should be considered as drawn from the same population. Implications for understanding the transmission geography and host associations of these viruses are discussed.",

A number of recent investigations have focused on linkages between diversiﬁcation, trophic morphology and diet in bats, partly because their roosting habits mean that for many bat species diet can be quantiﬁed relatively easily through faecal analysis. Dietary analysis in mammals is otherwise invasive, complicated, time consuming and expensive. Here we present evidence from insectivorous bats that analysis of three-dimensional (3-D) textures of tooth microwear using International Organization for Standardization (ISO) roughness parameters derived from sub-micron surface data provides an additional, powerful tool for investigation of trophic resource exploitation in mammals. Our approach, like scale-sensitive fractal analysis, offers considerable advantages over twodimensional (2-D) methods of microwear analysis, including improvements in robustness, repeatability and comparability of studies. Our results constitute the ﬁrst analysis of microwear textures in carnivorous mammals based on ISO roughness parameters. They demonstrate that the method is capable of dietary discrimination, even between cryptic species with subtly different diets within trophic guilds, and even when sample sizes are small. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in microwear textures between insectivore species whose diet contains different proportions of ‘hard’ prey (such as beetles) and ‘soft’ prey (such as moths), and multivariate analyses are able to distinguish between species with different diets based solely on their tooth microwear textures. Our results show that, compared with previous 2-D analyses of microwear in bats, ISO roughness parameters provide a much more sophisticated characterization of the nature of microwear surfaces and can yield more robust and subtle dietary discrimination. ISO-based textural analysis of tooth microwear thus has a useful role to play, complementing existing approaches, in trophic analysis of mammals, both extant and extinct.",

            "abstractNote": "Comparative correlational studies of brain size and ecological traits (e.g. feeding habits and habitat complexity) have increased our knowledge about the selective pressures on brain evolution. Studies conducted in bats as a model system assume that shared evolutionary history has a maximum effect on the traits. However, this effect has not been quantiﬁed. In addition, the effect of levels of diet specialization on brain size remains unclear. We examined the role of diet on the evolution of brain size in Mormoopidae and Phyllostomidae using two comparative methods. Body mass explained 89% of the variance in brain volume. The effect of feeding behaviour (either characterized as feeding habits, as levels of specialization on a type of item or as handling behaviour) on brain volume was also signiﬁcant albeit not consistent after controlling for body mass and the strength of the phylogenetic signal (k). Although the strength of the phylogenetic signal of brain volume and body mass was high when tested individually, k values in phylogenetic generalized least squares models were signiﬁcantly different from 1. This suggests that phylogenetic independent contrasts models are not always the best approach for the study of ecological correlates of brain size in New World bats.",

Native species had higher SHI than introduced species, but SHI was not related to the level of species conservation concern. SHI was positively related to geographical range and/or population size and to functional group: large herbivores had higher SHI, then carnivores, rodents, small herbivores, bats and insectivores.",

            "abstractNote": "Heterogeneous pathogenic stress can shape major histocompatibility complex (MHC) diversity by influencing the functional plasticity of the immune response. Therefore, MHC diversity could reflect environmental stress, demonstrating its importance in uncovering the mechanisms of adaptive genetic variation. In this study, we combined neutral microsatellite loci, an immune-­related MHC II-­DRB locus, and climatic factors to unravel the mechanisms affecting the diversity and genetic differentiation of MHC genes in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), a species with a wide geographical distribution that has three distinct genetic lineages in China. First, increased genetic differentiation at the MHC locus among populations compared using microsatellites indicated diversifying selection. Second, the genetic differentiation of MHC and microsatellites were significantly correlated, suggesting that demographic processes exist. However, MHC genetic differentiation was significantly correlated with geographical distance among populations, even after controlling for the neutral markers, suggesting a major effect of selection. Third, although the MHC genetic differentiation was larger than that for microsatellites, there was no significant difference in the genetic differentiation between the two markers among genetic lineages, indicating the effect of balancing selection. Fourth, combined with climatic factors, MHC diversity and supertypes showed significant correlations with temperature and precipitation, but not with the phylogeographic structure of R. ferrumequinum, suggesting an effect of local adaptation driven by climate on MHC diversity. Moreover, the number of MHC supertypes varied between populations and lineages, suggesting regional characteristics and support for local adaptation. Taken together, the results of our study provide insights into the adaptive evolutionary driving forces at different geographic scales in R. ferrumequinum. In addition, climate factors may have played a vital role in driving adaptive evolution in this species.",

The African naked mole-rat (\n              Heterocephalus glaber\n              ) and hibernating mammals share similar environments and physiological features. In the naked mole-rat, acid insensitivity has been shown to be conferred by the functional motif of the sodium ion channel Na\n              V\n              1.7. There is now an opportunity to evaluate acid insensitivity in other taxa. In this study, we tested for functional convergence of Na\n              V\n              1.7 in 71 species of mammals, including 22 species that hibernate. Our analyses revealed a functional convergence of amino acid sequences, which occurred at least six times independently in mammals that hibernate. Evolutionary analyses determined that the convergence results from both parallel and divergent evolution of residues in the functional motif. Our findings not only identify the functional molecules responsible for acid insensitivity in hibernating mammals, but also open new avenues to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of acid insensitivity in mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "The east-coast free-tailed bat Mormopterus norfolkensis Gray, 1839 is a threatened insectivorous bat that is poorly known and as such conservation management strategies are only broadly prescribed. Insectivorous bats that use human-modiﬁed landscapes are often adapted to foraging in open microhabitats. However, few studies have explored whether open-adapted bats select landscapes with more of these microhabitat features.We compared three morphologically similar and sympatric, molossid bats (genus Mormopterus) with different conservation status in terms of their association with vegetation, climate, landform and land-use attributes at landscape and local habitat element scales.We predicted that these species would use similar landscape types, with semi-cleared and low density urban landscapes used more than forested and heavily cleared landscapes. Additionally, we explored which environmental variables best explained the occurrence of each species by constructing post-hoc models and habitat suitability maps. Contrary to predictions, we found that the three species varied in their habitat use with no one landscape type used more extensively than other types. Overall, M. norfolkensis was more likely to occur in low-lying, non-urban, riparian habitats with little vegetation cover. Mormopterus species 2 occupied similar habitats, but was more tolerant of urban landscapes. In contrast, Mormopterus species 4 occurred more often in cleared than forested landscapes, particularly dry landscapes with little vegetation cover.The extensive use of coastal ﬂoodplains by the threatened M. norfolkensis is signiﬁcant because these habitats are under increasing pressure from human land-uses and the predicted increase in urbanization is likely to further reduce the amount of suitable habitat.",

            "abstractNote": "Habitat loss and resultant fragmentation are major threats to biodiversity, particularly in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. It is increasingly urgent to understand fragmentation effects, which are often complex and vary across taxa, time and space. We determined whether recent fragmentation of Atlantic forest is causing population subdivision in a widespread and important Neotropical seed disperser: Artibeus lituratus (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae). Genetic structure within highly fragmented forest in Paraguay was compared to that in mostly contiguous forest in neighbouring Misiones, Argentina. Further, observed genetic structure across the fragmented landscape was compared with expected levels of structure for similar time spans in realistic simulated landscapes under different degrees of reduction in gene ﬂow. If fragmentation signiﬁcantly reduced successful dispersal, greater population differentiation and stronger isolation by distance would be expected in the fragmented than in the continuous landscape, and genetic structure in the fragmented landscape should be similar to structure for simulated landscapes where dispersal had been substantially reduced. Instead, little genetic differentiation was observed, and no signiﬁcant correlation was found between genetic and geographic distance in fragmented or continuous landscapes. Furthermore, comparison of empirical and simulated landscapes indicated empirical results were consistent with regular long-distance dispersal and high migration rates. Our results suggest maintenance of high gene ﬂow for this relatively mobile and generalist species, which could be preventing or signiﬁcantly delaying reduction in population connectivity in fragmented habitat. Our conclusions apply to A. lituratus in Interior Atlantic Forest, and do not contradict broad evidence that habitat fragmentation is contributing to extinction of populations and species, and poses a threat to biodiversity worldwide.",

            "abstractNote": "Automated monitoring technologies can increase the efﬁciency of ecological data collection and support data-driven conservation. Camera traps coupled with infrared light barriers can be used to monitor temperate-zone bat assemblages at underground hibernacula, where thousands of individuals of multiple species can aggregate in winter. However, the broad-scale adoption of such photo-monitoring techniques is limited by the time-consuming bottleneck of manual image processing. Here, we present BatNet, an open-source, deep learning-based tool for automated identiﬁcation of 13 European bat species from camera trap images. BatNet includes a user-friendly graphical interface, where it can be retrained to identify new bat species or to create site-speciﬁc models to improve detection accuracy at new sites. Model accuracy was evaluated on images from both trained and untrained sites, and in an ecological context, where community- and species-level metrics (species diversity, relative abundance, and species-level activity patterns) were compared between human experts and BatNet. At trained sites, model performance was high across all species (F1-score: 0.98–1). At untrained sites, overall classiﬁcation accuracy remained high (96.7–98.2%), when camera placement was comparable to the training images (<3 m from the entrance; <45° angle relative to the opening). For atypical camera placements (>3 m or >45° angle), retraining the detector model with 500 site-speciﬁc annotations achieved an accuracy of over 95% at all sites. In the ecological case study, all investigated metrics were nearly identical between human experts and BatNet. Finally, we exemplify the ability to retrain BatNet to identify a new bat species, achieving an F1-score of 0.99 while maintaining high classiﬁcation accuracy for all original species. BatNet can be implemented directly to scale up the deployment of camera traps in Europe and enhance bat population monitoring. Moreover, the pretrained model can serve as a baseline for transfer learning to automatize the image-based identiﬁcation of bat species worldwide.",

Recent studies also demonstrate the value of both rangewide sampling and species distribution modelling (SDM) in comparative phylogeography. Here, we combine these approaches to study the population histories of four phylogenetically related forest-dependent bat species. All are endemic to the mountainous island of Taiwan but show differences in their tolerance to altitude, with Murina gracilis considered to be a high-altitude specialist, M. recondita and Kerivoula sp. low-altitude specialists, and M. puta an altitudinal generalist. We tested the prediction that contrasting habitat preferences would impact on patterns of past and contemporary gene ﬂow and found broad concordance between the results of population genetic analyses and species distribution models based on the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate. Both lowland species showed evidence of genetic divergence between the east and west of the island, consistent with SDMs that indicated the Central Mountain Range (CMR) has presented a long-term and continuous barrier to gene ﬂow since before the Last Glacial Maximum. In contrast, Murina gracilis and M. puta showed lower degrees of historical isolation and genetic differentiation associated with the CMR, reﬂecting greater gene ﬂow, possibly coupled with past population growth in M. puta. Together our results highlight the usefulness of combining distribution models with phylogeographic analyses to understand the drivers of genetic structure.",

The two bat species Murina gracilis and Murina recondita are both endemic to Taiwan and are putative sister species. To test for nonallopatric divergence and gene ﬂow in these taxa, we generated sequences using Sanger and next-generation sequencing, and combined these with microsatellite data for coalescent-based analyses. MtDNA phylogenies supported the reciprocally monophyletic sister relationship between M. gracilis and M. recondita; however, clustering of microsatellite genotypes revealed several cases of species admixture suggesting possible introgression. Sequencing of microsatellite ﬂanking regions revealed that admixture signatures stemmed from microsatellite allele homoplasy rather than recent introgressive hybridization, and also uncovered an unexpected sister relationship between M. recondita and the continental species Murina eleryi, to the exclusion of M. gracilis. To dissect the basis of these conﬂicts between ncDNA and mtDNA, we analysed sequences from 10 anonymous ncDNA loci with *BEAST and isolation-withmigration and found two distinct clades of M. eleryi, one of which was sister to M. recondita. We conclude that Taiwan was colonized by the ancestor of M. gracilis ﬁrst, followed by the ancestor of M. recondita after a period of allopatric divergence. After colonization, the mitochondrial genome of M. recondita was replaced by that of the resident M. gracilis. This study illustrates how apparent signatures of sympatric divergence can arise from complex histories of allopatric divergence, colonization and hybridization, thus highlighting the need for rigorous analyses to distinguish between such scenarios.",

These ‘recall’ data often form the basis of wildlife sustainability assessments and, ultimately, policy decisions and management actions, but they are highly vulnerable to bias, particularly when the behavior of interest has strong temporal variation. Here, we investigate bias in recalls of wildlife consumption in rural Madagascar by comparing oral recalls collected monthly and annually from male heads of household with daily diet diaries maintained by female heads of household. Daily diet calendars collected from 28 households were assumed to be the measure of true consumption and were used to validate the recalled information. While we found little interhousehold variation in accuracy of responses, we found a tendency for recalls to overreport rates of wildlife consumption. Estimating the annual frequency of rare and/or seasonal events was quantiﬁed more accurately by recalls of the prior year than by extrapolation of recalls of the prior month. We conclude that monthly variation in consumption rate leads to predictable errors in estimation of the annual consumption rate. Local consumption of wildlife has large temporal variability, reﬂecting human preference or the underlying life cycles of animals being consumed. Accurate assessment of consumption rates therefore requires determining an appropriate recall period by taking into account the temporal variability and frequency of the events in question.",

At least two analytical approaches to solving this problem have been utilized: (1) simultaneous analysis of molecular sequence and morphological data with fossil taxa included as terminals in the analysis, and (2) the molecular scaffold approach, in which morphological data are analyzed over a molecular backbone (with constraints that force extant taxa into positions suggested by sequence data). The perceived obstacles to including fossil taxa directly in simultaneous analyses of morphological and molecular sequence data with extant taxa include: (1) that fossil taxa are missing the molecular sequence portion of the character data; (2) that morphological characters might be misleading due to convergence; and (3) character weighting, specifically how and whether to weight characters in the morphological partition relative to characters in the molecular sequence data partition. The molecular scaffold has been put forward as a potential solution to at least some of these problems. Using examples of simultaneous analyses from the literature, as well as new analyses of previously published morphological and molecular sequence data matrices for extant and fossil Chiroptera (bats), we argue that the simultaneous analysis approach is superior to the molecular scaffold approach, specifically addressing the problems to which the molecular scaffold has been suggested as a solution. Finally, the application of phylogenetic hypotheses including fossil taxa (whatever their derivation) to the study of morphological character evolution is discussed, with special emphasis on scenarios in which fossil taxa are likely to be most enlightening: (1) in determining the sequence of character evolution; (2) in determining the timing of character evolution; and (3) in making inferences about the presence or absence of characteristics in fossil taxa that may not be directly observable in the fossil record.",

Current trends even predict an increase in land area devoted to olive farms as well as the intensiﬁcation of farming practices. However, knowledge of the effects of olive farming on animal species still remains elusive and conservation and management guidelines for the relevant stakeholders are therefore urgently needed. Here, we investigate community composition and activity patterns of insectivorous bats in Mediterranean olive monocultures in Southern Portugal. Bats surveys were carried out in three types of olive farms representing increasing levels of management intensity: (1) traditional olive farms, managed with few or no chemical inputs or manual labor; (2) semiintensive olive farms, which share certain characteristics with traditional plantations, but are more intensively managed; (3) intensive olive farms, which are managed with high and frequent chemical inputs, and highly mechanized systems. We found differences in species richness and activity levels between farming practices. Both the number of species and foraging activity declined with increasing management intensity. However, olive groves as a whole showed a lower number of species compared with the regional species pool and extremely low activity levels, suggesting that large and homogeneous olive monocultures may serve more as commuting areas than true foraging habitats for bats. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study explicitly demonstrating the pervasive impact of olive farming on the community composition and activity levels of insectivorous bats. In the face of an even-increasing proportion of land surface devoted to olive farming in Mediterranean landscapes, our ﬁndings are therefore of great concern. We suggest that increasing habitat heterogeneity would contribute to preserve the community composition and ecological functionality of insectivorous bats in extensive olive monocultures.",

We hypothesised that the most important determining variables would not vary between different forest habitats and that social constraints may play a role in limiting commuting distances between roosting and foraging sites. Altogether 11 post-lactating adult females were radio-tracked in two predominantly oak forest habitats, where both potential roost and tree stand characteristics differed. We recorded 18 roosts; the distances between occupied roosts and commuting distances to foraging areas were measured. Within a 0.1 ha wide plot centred on each roost, a total of 17 habitat variables were recorded. Regardless of the different habitat structure (canopy closure, stand density) and roost-site availability, tracked females selected tree hollows with similar dimensions. The size of both roosting and foraging areas did not differ between habitats. We suggest that protection from predators and social constraints may determine the spatial distribution of Bechstein‟s bat roosts.",

UAVs are excellent candidates to greatly increase the environments in which such arrays can be deployed, but the impact of UAV noise on recording quality and the UAV's behavioral impact on the bats may affect usability. We developed a UAV-­borne multimicrophone setup capable of recording bat echolocation across diverse environments. We quantify and mitigate the impact of UAV noise on the recording setup and test the recording capability of the array by recording four common Danish bat species: Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Myotis daubentonii, Eptesicus serotinus, and Nyctalus noctula. The UAV produces substantial noise at ultrasonic frequencies relevant to many bat species. However, suspending the array 30 m below the UAV attenuates the noise to levels below the self-­noise of our recording system at 20 kHz and above, and we successfully record and acoustically localize all four bat species. The behavioral impact of the UAV is minimal as all four species approached the array to within 1 m and all emitted recordable feeding buzzes. UAV-­ borne multimicrophone arrays will allow us to quantify bat echolocation in hitherto unexplored habitats and provide crucial insight into how bats operate their sonar across their entire natural habitat.",

Evidence suggests that L. nivalis follows the blooms of paniculate agave plants (genus Agave, subgenus Agave). Paniculate agave inﬂorescences are adapted to attract bats, and studies have indicated that Leptonycteris spp. played a key role in Agave speciation. We test the hypothesis of the Agave migratory corridor by (1) modelling the distribution of the relevant Agave species; and (2) testing whether bat records are signiﬁcantly related to Agave species richness as predicted by our models.",

            "abstractNote": "Measures of traits are the basis of functional biological diversity. Numerous works consider mean species-level measures of traits while ignoring individual variance within species. However, there is a large amount of variation within species and it is increasingly apparent that it is important to consider trait variation not only between species, but also within species. Mammals are an interesting group for investigating trait-based approaches because they play diverse and important ecological functions (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal, predation, grazing) that are correlated with functional traits. Here we compile a data set comprising morphological and life history information of 279 mammal species from 39,850 individuals of 388 populations ranging from À5.83 to À29.75 decimal degrees of latitude and À34.82 to À56.73 decimal degrees of longitude in the Atlantic forest of South America. We present trait information from 16,840 individuals of 181 species of non-volant mammals (Rodentia, Didelphimorphia, Carnivora, Primates, Cingulata, Artiodactyla, Pilosa, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla) and from 23,010 individuals of 98 species of volant mammals (Chiroptera). The traits reported include body mass, age, sex, reproductive stage, as well as the geographic coordinates of sampling for all taxa. Moreover, we gathered information on forearm length for bats and body length and tail length for rodents and marsupials. No copyright restrictions are associated with the use of this data set. Please cite this data paper when the data are used in publications. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using the data.",

Here, we investigated how bats respond to the motion-triggered lighting of a bicycle path, an infrastructure that is increasingly being built to support human mobility. We measured the acoustic activity of bats in relation to the activity of LED lights. The responses of bats varied during the night and between functional guilds: Edge-space foraging bats avoided LED lighting, but the response was less clear during early and late night. Open-space foraging and narrow-space foraging bats avoided the LED lighting, especially late at night. The foraging intensity remained relatively stable across the night for bats of all guilds. We conclude that the motion-sensitive LED lighting of bicycle paths induces a guild-specific avoidance response in bats, which could be mitigated by shorter lighting periods.",

High-intensity echolocating species that used shorter, broadband signals and had shorter, broader wings (Pteronotus macleayii, Pteronotus quadridens, Mormoops blainvillii) foraged most in edge habitats, but differed in timing of peak activity. P. macleayii and M. blainvillii differed in diet, but low sample size precluded diet analysis for P. quadridens. High-intensity echolocating species that used longer, more narrowband signals and had longer, narrower wings (Molossus molossus, Tadarida brasiliensis) foraged most in open areas and differed in diet from the other species. Two disparate species were most active in clutter (dense vegetation). Pteronotus parnellii used high-duty-cycle echolocation apparently specialized for detecting ﬂuttering targets in clutter. Macrotus waterhousii used low-intensity, broadband echolocation calls and presumably uses prey-generated sounds when foraging. These two species also differed in diet. Our data show that differences in morphology and echolocation behaviour coincide with differences in habitat use and diet, resulting in minimal overlap in resource use among species.",

            "abstractNote": "Billions of birds migrate at night over North America each year. However, few studies have described the phenology of these movements, such as magnitudes, directions, and speeds, for more than one migration season and at regional scales. In this study, we characterize density, direction, and speed of nocturnally migrating birds using data from 13 weather surveillance radars in the autumns of 2010 and 2011 in the northeastern USA. After screening radar data to remove precipitation, we applied a recently developed algorithm for characterizing velocity profiles with previously developed methods to document bird migration. Many hourly radar scans contained windborne “contamination,” and these scans also exhibited generally low overall reflectivities. Hourly scans dominated by birds showed nightly and seasonal patterns that differed markedly from those of low reflectivity scans. Bird migration occurred during many nights, but a smaller number of nights with large movements of birds defined regional nocturnal migration. Densities varied by date, time, and location but peaked in the second and third deciles of night during the autumn period when the most birds were migrating. Migration track (the direction to which birds moved) shifted within nights from south-­southwesterly to southwesterly during the seasonal migration peaks; this shift was not consistent with a similar shift in wind direction. Migration speeds varied within nights, although not closely with wind speed. Airspeeds increased during the night; groundspeeds were highest between the second and third deciles of night, when the greatest density of birds was migrating. Airspeeds and groundspeeds increased during the fall season, although groundspeeds fluctuated considerably with prevailing winds. Significant positive correlations characterized relationships among bird densities at southern coastal radar stations and northern inland radar stations. The quantitative descriptions of broadscale nocturnal migration patterns presented here will be essential for biological and conservation applications. These descriptions help to define migration phenology in time and space, fill knowledge gaps in avian annual cycles, and are useful for monitoring long-t­erm population trends of migrants. Furthermore, these descriptions will aid in assessing potential risks to migrants, particularly from structures with which birds collide and artificial lighting that disorients migrants.",

By molecular investigations, using a generic real-time RTPCR (RT-qPCR) that detects all previously known inﬂuenza A virus subtypes (H1-H16) and a newly developed RT-qPCR speciﬁc for the South American bat inﬂuenza-like virus of subtype H17, a total of 1571 samples obtained from 1369 individual bats of 26 species from Central Europe were examined. No evidence for the occurrence of such inﬂuenza viruses was found. Further attempts towards a more comprehensive evaluation of the role of bats in the ecology and epidemiology of inﬂuenza viruses should be based on more intense monitoring efforts. However, given the protected status of bats, not only in Europe, such activities need to be embedded into existing pathogen-monitoring programs.",

            "abstractNote": "Data papers and open databases have revolutionized contemporary science, as they provide the long-needed incentive to collaborate in large international teams and make natural history information widely available. Nevertheless, most data papers have focused on species occurrence or abundance, whereas interactions have received much less attention. To help fill this gap, we have compiled a georeferenced data set of interactions between 93 bat species of the family Phyllostomidae (Chiroptera) and 501 plant species of 68 families. Data came from 169 studies published between 1957 and 2007 covering the entire Neotropical Region, with most records from Brazil (34.5% of all study sites), Costa Rica (16%), and Mexico (14%). Our data set includes 2571 records of frugivory (75.1% of all records) and nectarivory (24.9%). The best represented bat genera are Artibeus (28% of all records), Carollia (24%), Sturnira (10.1%), and Glossophaga (8.8%). Carollia perspicillata (187), Artibeus lituratus (125), Artibeus jamaicensis (94), Glossophaga soricina (86), and Artibeus planirostris (74) were the bat species with the broadest diets recorded based on the number of plant species. Among the plants, the best represented families were Moraceae (17%), Piperaceae (15.4%), Urticaceae (9.2%), and Solanaceae (9%).",

Here, we introduce tree\n                    NODF\n                    , a new class of nestedness that takes into account the resemblance of descriptor variables.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    The method is an extension of the\n                    NODF\n                    index and can be applied to systems in which the resemblance of descriptor variables is described by a tree‐like object. Computation of tree\n                    NODF\n                    is similar to\n                    NODF\n                    , but uses branch lengths instead of the sum of species occurrences. In this way, we can calculate a phylo\n                    NODF\n                    for metacommunities if a phylogeny is used to account for differences in phylogenetic diversity (\n                    PD\n                    ) and trait\n                    NODF\n                    if a functional dendrogram constructed from species ecological traits is used to account for the functional diversity (\n                    FD\n                    ) of communities. Similar to\n                    NODF\n                    , tree\n                    NODF\n                    can also be used to assess nestedness among species. In this case, env\n                    NODF\n                    uses a dendrogram describing the resemblance among the environmental conditions of different sites, to test whether rare species occur in a subset of the environmental conditions in the habitats occupied by frequent species.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    tree\n                    NODF\n                    is a composite metric that can be additively partitioned into compositional (S.fraction) and tree‐topology (topo\n                    NODF\n                     = tree\n                    NODF\n                    – S.fraction) components of the descriptor variables. Tests of tree\n                    NODF\n                    and its components can be carried out using null models and, if a hypothetical factor is used to order metacommunity data, permutation tests. We show that tree\n                    NODF\n                    is robust for matrix size and fill, as well as for tree topology.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Finally, we illustrate the use of tree\n                    NODF\n                    by analysing data on Caribbean bats using phylo\n                    NODF\n                    , trait\n                    NODF\n                    and env\n                    NODF\n                    , as well as their composition and tree‐topology components.",

For highly mobile species that actively move among potential breeding locations, coupling survival information with estimates of locational ﬁdelity provides the basis for our understanding of species population dynamics. We studied the effect of time, age and sex class and climatic variables on survival and roost transition probabilities on a population of Egyptian slit-faced bats in Swaziland from 1450 marked individuals from 16 roosts over a 10-year period. We then used variance components analysis to estimate average annual survival and associated temporal process variance. Annual apparent survival varied with sex and age, being highest in adult males and lowest in juvenile females. We did not ﬁnd evidence of survival being inﬂuenced by climatological factors as commonly observed in temperate bats. Roost switching occurred frequently, with more transitions to roosts harboring larger number of bats. Furthermore, the probability of transitioning to another roost was related to its distance from the original roost. The dispersal patterns revealed in this study were consistent with the ﬁssion–fusion dynamics common for colonial bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are the second most diverse mammal order and they provide vital ecosystem functions (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient flux in caves) and services (e.g., crop pest suppression). Bats are also important vectors of infectious diseases, harboring more than 100 different virus types. In the present study, we compiled information on bat communities from the Atlantic Forests of South America, a species-rich biome that is highly threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. The ATLANTIC BATS data set comprises 135 quantitative studies carried out in 205 sites, which cover most vegetation types of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest: dense ombrophilous forest, mixed ombrophilous forest, semideciduous forest, deciduous forest, savanna, steppe, and open ombrophilous forest. The data set includes information on more than 90,000 captures of 98 bat species of eight families. Species richness averaged 12.1 per site, with a median value of 10 species (ranging from 1 to 53 species). Six species occurred in more than 50% of the communities: Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Sturnira lilium, Artibeus fimbriatus, Glossophaga soricina, and Platyrrhinus lineatus. The number of captures divided by sampling effort, a proxy for abundance, varied from 0.000001 to 0.77 individualsÁhÀ1ÁmÀ2 (0.04 Æ 0.007 individualsÁhÀ1ÁmÀ2). Our data set reveals a hyper-dominance of eight species that together that comprise 80% of all captures: Platyrrhinus lineatus (2.3%), Molossus molossus (2.8%), Artibeus obscurus (3.4%), Artibeus planirostris (5.2%), Artibeus fimbriatus (7%), Sturnira lilium (14.5%), Carollia perspicillata (15.6%), and Artibeus lituratus (29.2%).",

            "abstractNote": "The microchiropteran bat family Emballonuridae is widely distributed in archipelagos of the southwestern Paciﬁc, with especially strong representation of genera Emballonura and Mosia. DNA sequences from three segments of the mitochondrial genome were collected from four species of Emballonura and from M. nigrescens to investigate the relationship of genetic differentiation to archipelago biogeography. Specimens of each species formed monophyletic clades in maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Mosia nigrescens was genetically distant to the other four species. The other four studied species formed a monophyletic clade composed of the pairs E. beccarii, E. serii and E. raffrayana, E. semicaudata. Clades within species were strongly concordant with geography, with only two counterexamples (E. semicaudata in Fiji and E. raffrayana in the Solomon Islands) to the general ﬁnding that each island’s population of a species constitutes a monophyletic clade. Genetic results do not agree with current subspeciﬁc designations within M. nigrescens. Samples from Woodlark, Alcester, and Manus Islands are phylogenetically closer to Papuan mainland samples than to Solomon Islands and New Ireland samples supposedly belonging to the same subspecies. Results suggest that Emballonura can establish populations across wide water barriers but does so infrequently. The isolating effect of water barriers is exempliﬁed by the substantial genetic distinctiveness of Solomon Islands and New Ireland populations of both E. raffrayana and M. nigrescens. Absence from New Britain of E. beccarii, E. raffrayana, and E. serii (all known from New Ireland) may also reﬂect effects of water barriers if not due to collecting artifacts.",

We evaluated the impact of eucalypt plantations on native bats in a Mediterranean area, taking Portugal as a case study. We compared the overall bat activity, species richness and Kuhl’s bat Pipistrellus kuhlii (the most abundant bat species in the area) activity between eucalypt plantations and native montado habitat, and examined the inﬂuence of stand, landscape and survey variables within plantations on the response variables. A set of 11 plantation stands, three landscape and two survey variables were employed as predictor variables using a zero-inﬂated Poisson generalized linear mixed model. Hawking and generalist bats of the genus Pipistrellus were the most frequently detected species. Bat activity, species richness and P. kuhlii activity were higher in native montado than in any of the eucalypt stands. Mature eucalypt plantations showed the highest bat activity, while clear-cut areas showed the lowest. Generally, within eucalypt stands, complex high-level vegetation structure, from the ground level up to 3 m high, and proximity to water points were associated with higher levels of bat and P. kuhlii activity and species richness. The results suggest that in order to promote bat diversity and activity in exotic eucalypt plantations in the Mediterranean region, it is important to provide a high density of water points, maintain plots of mature plantations and promote understorey clutter.",

Croton piptocalF, Bauhinia f.$cata subsp. pruinosa, Senna macranthera, Schizolobium parahyba, Piptadenia gonoacantha, Chorisia speciosa, Pseudobombax grandijlorum, Firm guaranitica, Esenbeckia leioratpa, Pachystroma longifolium, Myroxylon peruifprum, and Hymenaea courbaril. Field trials were carried out at Santa Genebra Municipal Reserve, Campinas, SP, Brazil, at the forest edge and in the understory. No significant correlations were detected between successional status and seed size or seed water content. Light-regulated germination was present only in small-seeded species. In field experiments, most species, including the light-sensitive ones, were able to germinate under the canopy, where a low red/far-red ratio predominates. Most species, mainly those of early- and intermediate successional positions, presented low seedling survival rates under shade. Myroxylon peru;ferum was the most shade tolerant species, while S. granuloso-lqrosum, C speciosa, I? gonoacantha, E guaranitica, 7: micrantha, and S. parahyba were the most shade intolerant. These latter species showed little or no survival under the shade conditions.",

Its populations are reported to be declining in much of the species’ geographical range, which is quite fragmented. In Italy R. mehelyi was thought to be extinct in peninsular Italy, and still occurring in Sardinia (with large colonies) and Sicily (two remnant colonies). For peninsular Italy its presence was reported only for Apulia (SE Italy) but the latest records dated back to the 1960’s. In this note we conﬁrm the presence of this species in the same region for the Zinzulusa Cave (Castro, Lecce).",

Yet, this process has too often been conducted at the cost of airborne biodiversity such as birds and bats. The latter are severely threatened due to deaths by collision at wind turbine. The UNEP/EUROBATS agreement that came into force in 1994 is now ratified by 37 countries; since 2008, it recommends to site wind turbines at least 200 m away from woody edges to decrease bat fatality risks. However, 14 years later we still do not know to what extent this international recommendation has been applied in Europe. We assessed siting distances between woody edges and wind turbines for the largest wind energy producers among the UNEP/EUROBATS parties: the UK, Germany, and France. We show that 61%, 78%, and 56%, respectively, of the installed wind turbines did not comply with UNEP/EUROBATS guidelines, without improvement over time. We identified probable causes of these findings and provided key policy recommendations to achieve compliance to UNEP/EUROBATS guidelines such as better: (i) inclusion in regulatory texts, (ii) notification of the environmental authorities, and (iii) strategic, well‐informed, forward planning of areas suitable for wind turbine development.",

Exemplified by the common vampire bat, we demonstrate the use of metabarcoding to infer predator population structure alongside diet assessments. Growing populations of common vampire bats impact human, livestock and wildlife health in Latin America through transmission of pathogens, such as lethal rabies viruses. Techniques to determine large-scale variation in vampire bat diet and bat population structure would empower locality- and species-specific projections of disease transmission risks. However, previously used methods are not cost-effective and efficient for large-scale applications. Using bloodmeal and faecal samples from common vampire bats from coastal, Andean and Amazonian regions of Peru, we showcase metabarcoding as a scalable tool to assess vampire bat population structure and feeding preferences. Dietary metabarcoding was highly effective, detecting vertebrate prey in 93.2% of the samples. Bats predominantly preyed on domestic animals, but fed on tapirs at one Amazonian site. In addition, we identified arthropods in 9.3% of samples, likely reflecting consumption of ectoparasites. Using the same data, we document mitochondrial geographic population structure in the common vampire bat in Peru. Such simultaneous inference of vampire bat diet and population structure can enable new insights into the interplay between vampire bat ecology and disease transmission risks. Importantly, the methodology can be incorporated into metabarcoding diet studies of other animals to couple information on diet and population structure.",

Long-tubed ﬂowers have specialized on one or several species of long-tongued euglossine bees, but longtongued bees have not specialized on long-tubed ﬂowers. Whereas long tongues may have evolved to provide access to a wider variety of nectar resources, long nectar spurs may be a mechanism for ﬂowers to conserve nectar resources while remaining attractive to traplining bee visitors.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding microhabitat requirements for species vulnerable to anthropogenic threats can provide important information to conservation managers. This may be particularly true for ectotherms, where behaviour and physiology (e.g. digestion, responsiveness and activity patterns) are strongly inﬂuenced by thermal conditions of microhabitat retreat sites. Retreat sites selected by south-west carpet pythons (Morelia spilota imbricata) were identiﬁed through radiotracking 46 pythons over 3 years. Tree hollows appear to be a very important resource for pythons: 61% (22 of 36 individuals tracked over winter) used tree hollows as retreat sites (56% of all observations in winter), and remained in hollows for an average of 124 Ϯ 49 (range 34 to 210) days. If pythons did not use tree hollows over winter, they found refuge in one of four alternative microhabitats: low vegetation cover (26% of winter observations), ground cover (10%), on tree branches (6%) or in hollow logs on the ground (2%). We tested whether tree hollows provide a thermally distinct environment compared with alternative microhabitats, but found no difference in minimum, average, maximum or range of temperatures recorded between microhabitats. When within tree hollows over winter, pythons had colder daily average and maximum body temperatures (cf. pythons that used other microhabitats), but this did not give them an energy saving (in terms of body condition scores). Pythons ate very little over winter and we predict that animals sequestered within tree hollows do not access prey at this time. Tree hollows provide a critical refuge over winter when python body temperature is low, and their responsiveness is limited, rendering individuals vulnerable to predation by terrestrial predators (e.g. introduced red fox). Destruction of hollows through ﬁre, land clearing, competition with other fauna species and the signiﬁcant age required for hollows to form in trees all contribute to the decline in availability of this important microhabitat.",

A 3‐cm charcoal layer was dated to 2720±30 cal. a\n              BP\n              and inferred to be Woodland Indian in origin from microscopic inspection and thickness.

European bats exemplify the need for successful and cost-effective management for both reasons, often simultaneously. Across Europe, bats are protected, and the concept of Favourable Conservation Status (FCS) is used as a key tool for the assessment and licensing of disruptive actions to populations. However, for efﬁcient decision-making, this assessment requires knowledge on the demographic rates and long-term dynamics of populations. We used capture–mark–recapture to describe demographic rates for the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) at two sites in England and investigate the transition rates between three stages: juveniles, immatures, and breeders. We then use these rates in an individual-based population dynamics model to investigate the expected trajectories for both populations. Our results demonstrate for the ﬁrst time the presence and scale of temporal variation in this species’ demography. We describe the lengthy prereproductive period (3.5 years) that female Serotines experience. Finally, we show how site-speciﬁc variation in demographic rates can produce divergent population trajectories. Effective management of European bat populations can be achieved through the understanding of life histories, and local demographic rates and population dynamics, in order to anticipate the presence of source and sink sites in the landscape. Using the Serotine bat in England, we show that these can be obtained from rigorous and systematic studies of long-term demographic datasets.",

As the number of electronic herbarium records proliferates, the importance of linking these records to the physical specimens they represent as well as to related records from other sources will intensify. Although a rich and diverse literature has developed over the past decade that addresses the use of specimen identifiers for facilitating linking across the internet, few implementable guidelines or recommended practices for herbaria have been advanced. Here we review this literature with the express purpose of distilling a specific set of recommendations especially tailored to herbarium specimen digitization, curation, and management. We argue that associating globally unique identifiers (\n              GUID\n              s) with physical herbarium specimens and including these identifiers in all electronic records about those specimens is essential to effective digital data curation. We also address practical applications for ensuring these associations.",

These species have different sex chromosome systems. Through banding techniques, chromosomes homologies between Carollia perspicillata and Rhinophylla pumilio were not found, possibly because Carollia species have highly rearranged chromosomes. Probably, Rhinophylla is better associated to Phyllostomini tribe. Sex vesicle pairing behavior at the meiotic prophase was analyzed in both species. R. pumilio had a simple sex chromosome system (XX/XY), the XY pair showed an asynchronic behavior compared to the autosomal bivalents. The sex vesicle showes the X and Y pairing in the pseudoautosomal region. Moreover, a folding of the X-asynaptic axis on itself and condensed differentiated axes were also identified. In C. perspicillata, with a multiple sex chromosome system (XY1Y2), the segments Xp-Y1 and Xq-Y2 paired independently from each other. Compared to the autosomes, the sex vesicle showed a precocious pairing behavior. In C. perspicillata, a NOR stained with silver was localized in the X rearranged chromosome. Possibly, this region separates the XY1Y2 trivalent in two independent parts: one involving the X and Y2 autosomal with transcriptional activity, and the other corresponding to the original X and Y sex pair.",

Exclosures were also used to determine the relative importance of vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators. Although species differed significantly in levels of predation, predation of seeds exposed to vertebrates was high (>75%) for all species, while seed predation by invertebrates was lower and more variable. Seed and seedling predation by insects was significantly higher in mature forest, while seed predation by rodents was higher in fallow areas. Other sources of mortality (primarily desiccation) were higher for seeds in fallow areas. The percentage of seeds moved was significantlydifferent among species but not between forests.",

We sampled a wide range of elevations and associated habitat types throughout Belize. Anabat provides an instantaneous output of echolocation call structure with a laptop computer. Select sequences can be saved directly to the hard drive, avoiding extraneous noise and sound distortion commonly associated with tape recorders. To date, 18 of the 37 species known or expected to occur in the study region were identified by recognizable differences in the time-frequency characteristics of echolocation calls. In general, each family is recognizable by call structure patterns and species readily separated by frequency range parameters. Species that commute or forage at high altitudes are not susceptible to capture but are conspicuous by acoustic sampling. Further work is needed to determine limitations of the equipment, establish better sampling procedures, and develop a comprehensive library of vocal signatures incorporating the range of variation inherent in each species. As this work progresses, we predict the addition of hitherto unknown species occurring within the study region.",

            "abstractNote": "Deltamethrin (DTM) is a synthetic pyrethroid widely used in the cultivation and management of several crops due to its insecticidal action. Application to crops of pyrethroids such as DTM can result in the of water and fruit consumed by fruit bats having a high pyrethroid content which may be harmful. Therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of short-t­erm oral exposure of the fruit-e­ ating bats (Artibeus lituratus) to two concentrations of DTM (0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg of papaya) on histopathology of the intestine, liver and kidney. The intestine of the animals exposed to both concentrations showed inflammatory infiltrate, degeneration, necrosis and goblet cell hyperplasia as the most frequent pathologies. Besides, the acid mucins showed an increase in the frequency of non-­ viable cells. The liver showed hepatocyte vacuolizatio and nuclear enlargement, as well as inflammatory infiltrate and steatosis. The kidneys of the exposed animals showed and inflammatory infiltrate, benign nephrosclerosis, vacuolization and necrosis. Also, DTM reduced nitric oxide synthesis, decreased glomerular diameter and increased glycogen percentage in the proximal tubules. Our results suggest that acute exposure to DTM at low concentrations has the potential to induce pronounced histopathological changes in vital organs, such as intestine, liver and kidney of fruit-­eating bats.",

We developed Animal Sound Identiﬁer (ASI), a MATLAB software that performs probabilistic classiﬁcation of species occurrences from ﬁeld recordings. Unlike most previous approaches, ASI locates training data directly from the ﬁeld recordings and thus avoids the need of pre-deﬁned reference libraries. We apply ASI to a case study on Amazonian birds, in which we classify the vocalisations of 14 species in 194 504 oneminute audio segments using in total two weeks of expert time to construct, parameterise, and validate the classiﬁcation models. We compare the classiﬁcation performance of ASI (with training templates extracted automatically from ﬁeld data) to that of monitoR (with training templates extracted manually from the Xeno-Canto database), the results showing ASI to have substantially higher recall and precision rates.",

            "abstractNote": "Niche partitioning through foraging is a mechanism likely involved in facilitating the coexistence of ecologically similar and co-occurring animal species by separating their use of resources. Yet, this mechanism is not well understood in flying insectivorous animals. This is particularly true of bats, where many ecologically similar or cryptic species coexist. The detailed analysis of the foraging niche in sympatric, cryptic sibling species provides an excellent framework to disentangle the role of specific niche factors likely involved in facilitating coexistence. We used DNA metabarcoding to determine the prey species consumed by a population of sympatric sibling Rhinolophus euryale and Rhinolophus mehelyi whose use of habitat in both sympatric and allopatric ranges has been well established through radio tracking. Although some subtle dietary differences exist in prey species composition, the diet of both bats greatly overlapped (Ojk = 0.83) due to the consumption of the same common and widespread moths. Those dietary differences we did detect might be related to divergences in prey availabilities among foraging habitats, which prior radio tracking on the same population showed are differentially used and selected when both species co-occur. This minor dietary segregation in sympatry may be the result of foraging on the same prey-types and could contribute to reduce potential competitive interactions (e.g., for prey, acoustic space). Our results highlight the need to evaluate the spatial niche dimension in mediating the cooccurrence of similar insectivorous bat species, a niche factor likely involved in processes of bat species coexistence.",

            "abstractNote": "Lower Central America (LCA) provides a geologically complex and dynamic, richly biodiverse model for studying the recent assembly and diversiﬁcation of a Neotropical biota. Here, we review the growing literature of LCA phylogeography studies and their contribution to understanding the origins, assembly, and diversiﬁcation of the LCA biota against the backdrop of regional geologic and climatic history, and previous biogeographical inquiry. Studies to date reveal that phylogeographical signal within taxa of differing distributions reﬂects a diversity of patterns and processes rivalling the complexities of LCA landscapes themselves. Even so, phylogeography is providing novel insights into regional diversiﬁcation (e.g. cryptic lineage divergences), and general evolutionary patterns are emerging. Congruent multi-taxon phylogeographic breaks are found across the Nicaraguan depression, Chorotega volcanic front, western and central Panama, and the Darie´n isthmus, indicating that a potentially shared history of responses to regional-scale (e.g. geological) processes has shaped the genetic diversity of LCA communities. By contrast, other species show unique demographic histories in response to overriding historical events, including no phylogeographic structure at all. These low-structure or incongruent patterns provide some evidence for a role of local, ecological factors (e.g. long-distance dispersal and gene ﬂow in plants and bats) in shaping LCA communities. Temporally, comparative phylogeographical structuring reﬂects Pliocene–Pleistocene dispersal and vicariance events consistent with the timeline of emergence of the LCA isthmus and its major physiographic features, e.g. cordilleras. We emphasise the need to improve biogeographic inferences in LCA through in-depth comparative phylogeography projects capitalising on the latest statistical phylogeographical methods. While meeting the challenges of reconstructing the biogeographical history of this complex region, phylogeographers should also take up the critical service to society of applying their work to the conservation of its fascinating biodiversity.",
