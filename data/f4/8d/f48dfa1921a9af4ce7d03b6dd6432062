            "abstractNote": "Failure of a flower to initiate fruit can be attributed to an insufficiency of resources, genetic incompatibilities, or ecological constraints on pollination. Flower visitors can increase fruit initiation by pollinating flowers, or decrease fruit initiation by damaging them. If, however, resources limit fruit initiation, variation in visitation may be relatively unimportant. Visitors to\n              Calyptrogyne ghiesbreghtiana,\n              a rain forest understory palm, leave a record of their activity by feeding on floral tissue. I recorded variation in inflorescence visitation, floral display, and fruit initiation during 7 mo over two field seasons. On average, bats visited 50‐60% of flowers; katydids and scarab beetles visited and damaged the remaining 40‐50%. Four species of bat (Phyllostomidae) captured near inflorescences were found to be carrying C.\n              ghiesbreghtiana\n              pollen. Approximately 18% of flowers visited by bats and not damaged by insects initiated fruit, whereas insect‐damaged flowers set a negligible number. Some variation in fruit initiation was explained by nightly variation in the proportion of inflorescences at each site that were potential pollen donors (male‐phase inflorescences). Visitors responded to variation in floral display; katydids damaged more flowers on taller inflorescences, and in one season bats visited a greater proportion of flowers on inflorescences with many flowers. However, floral display only explained a small amount of variation in visitation. A similar amount of variation in flower visitation was explained by the degree to which inflorescences were obstructed by surrounding vegetation. I used path analysis to summarize the overall effect of floral display on visitation by both pollinators and florivores and the effect of visitation and site sex ratio on fruit initiation. Because almost all flowers were visited by bats or damaged by katydids, the amount of bat visitation was strongly negatively correlated with katydid damage. In spite of the low fruit set from bat‐visited flowers, variation in bat visitation explained 27‐37% of the variation in fruit initiation.",

The hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus) is highly migratory and ranges farther across North America than any other wild mammal. Despite the ecological importance of this species as a major insect predator, and the particular susceptibility of lasiurine bats to wind turbine strikes, our understanding of hoary bat ecology, physiology, and behavior remains poor. Methods: To better understand adaptive evolution in this lineage, we used whole-genome sequencing to identify protein-coding sequence and explore signatures of positive selection. Gene models were predicted with Maker and compared to seven well-annotated and phylogenetically representative species. Evolutionary rate analysis was performed with PAML. Results: Of 9,447 single-copy orthologous groups that met evaluation criteria, 150 genes had a signiﬁcant excess of nonsynonymous substitutions along the L. cinereus branch (P < 0.001 after manual review of alignments). Selected genes as a group had biased expression, most strongly in thymus tissue. We identiﬁed 23 selected genes with reported immune functions as well as a divergent paralog of Steep1 within suborder Yangochiroptera. Seventeen genes had roles in lipid and glucose metabolic pathways, partially overlapping with 15 mitochondrion-associated genes; these adaptations may reﬂect the metabolic challenges of hibernation, long-distance migration, and seasonal variation in prey abundance. The genomic distribution of positively selected genes differed signiﬁcantly from background expectation by discrete Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (P < 0.001). Remarkably, the top three physical clusters all coincided with islands of conserved synteny predating Mammalia, the largest of which shares synteny with the human cat-eye critical region (CECR) on 22q11. This observation coupled with the expansion of a novel Tbx1-like gene family may indicate evolutionary innovation during pharyngeal arch development: both the CECR and Tbx1 cause dosage-dependent congenital abnormalities in thymus, heart, and head, and craniodysmorphy is associated with human orthologs of other positively selected genes as well.",

The impact of this mortality on species census size is not understood, due in part to the difficulty of estimating population size for this highly migratory and elusive species. Genetic effective population size (Ne) could provide an index of changing census population size if other factors affecting Ne are stable.",

This record expands the species’ distributional range in Mexico along the peninsula. We propose 2 plausible biogeographical explanations. First, the species has the ability to travel across the Gulf of California from the coast of Sonora to the eastern side of the Baja California peninsula and there establish. Second, there is a continuous distribution of the species throughout the mountain ranges that run longitudinally along the Baja California peninsula from the United States border down to the southern tip. We collected one male specimen of E. underwoodi in xeric-riparian habitat. We suggest a continuous distribution pattern of this species along the cliffs in the Baja California peninsula.",

            "abstractNote": "Anthropogenic inﬂuence on ecosystems, such as habitat fragmentation, impacts species diversity and interactions. There is growing evidence that degradation of habitats favours disease and hence aﬀects ecosystem health. The prevalence of haemoparasites in the Common Fruit Bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) in a tropical lowland forest in Panama´ was studied. We assessed the relation of haemoparasite to the general condition of the animals and tested for possible association of haemoparasite prevalence to habitat fragmentation, with special focus on trypanosomes. Overall, a total of 250 A. jamaicensis sampled from fragmented sites, here man-made, forested islands in Lake Gatu` n, and sites in the adjacent, continuous forest in and around the Barro Colorado Nature Monument were examined. Using microscopy and DNA-sequencing 2 dominant types of haemoparasite infections, trypanosomes and Litomosoides (Nematoda) were identiﬁed. Trypanosome prevalence was signiﬁcantly higher in bats from forest fragments, than in bats captured in continuous forest. We attribute this to the loss of species richness in forest fragments and speciﬁc characteristics of the fragments favouring trypanosome transmission, in particular changes in vegetation cover. Interestingly, the eﬀect of habitat fragmentation on the prevalence of trypanosomes as multi-host parasites could not be observed in Litomosoides which probably has a higher host speciﬁcity and might be aﬀected less by overall diversity loss.",

Hypotheses include the need for a stable microclimate, protection from predators, proximity to foraging habitat, and availability of alternative roosts, among others. Our objective was to weigh evidence for hypotheses regarding selection of diurnal summer roosts using southeastern myotis (Myotis austroriparius) as a model. We used transect searches and radiotelemetry to locate 25 roosts at eight study sites across the Coastal Plain of Georgia, USA. We measured 22 characteristics of trees, at all occupied roosts and at randomly selected unoccupied trees. We evaluated 10 hypotheses using single-season occupancy models. The best supported model predicted bat presence based on the variables tree species, solid wood volume, and canopy cover. Because these characters affect heat retention and insolation, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that bats select roosts that provide a favorable microclimate. However, data on roost temperature and humidity are needed for a conclusive determination. Occupancy was greatest at the study area closest to caves occupied by southeastern myotis. Water tupelo trees appear to be an important resource for this species, although proximity to suitable caves also seems to affect presence and should be considered in conservation planning.",

Individuals of this species roost in tight clusters, and emit an acoustically rich repertoire of calls whose behavioral significance is largely unknown. We recorded their social and vocal behaviors within a colony housed under semi-natural conditions. We also quantified the spatial spread of each bat’s roosting location and discovered that this was relatively fixed and roughly confined to an individual’s body width. The spatial precision in roosting was accompanied by an equally remarkable match between specific vocalizations and well-timed, discrete, identifiable postures/behaviors, as revealed by logistic regression analysis. The bodily behaviors included crouching, marking, yawning, nipping, flicking, fighting, kissing, inspecting, and fly-bys. Two echolocation-like calls were used to maintain spacing in the colony, two noisy broadband calls were emitted during fights, two tonal calls conveyed fear, and another tonal call signaled appeasement. Overall, the results establish that mustached bats exhibit complex social interactions common to other social mammals. The correspondence of relatively low frequency and noisy, broadband calls with aggression, and of tonal, high frequency calls with fear supports Morton’s Motivation-Structure hypothesis, and establishes a link between motivation and the acoustic structure of social calls emitted by mustached bats.",

            "abstractNote": "The diet of the Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) has been well studied with a large inventory of nectar and fruit bearing plant species known to be consumed. It is far less certain, however, whether pteropodid bats intentionally supplement their diet with insects in a similar fashion to many other frugivorous and nectivorous species, including some New World fruit bats of the family Phyllostomidae. Several reports of pteropodid bats consuming insects in captivity exist, and insects have been found in the faeces and digestive tracts of some wild pteropodid bats, although their ingestion was initially thought to be accidental. However, more recent observations of large insects in faeces of wild bats, coupled with two reports (one anecdotal) of observed intentional insectivory in the wild, suggest that intentional insectivory by pteropodid bats may be more common than previously thought. In addition, reports of intentional insectivory to date have been of bats catching insects from a stationary position, and a large question still remains as to the ability of pteropodid bats to catch insects in flight without the use of laryngeal echolocation. Here, we report on an observation of intentional insectivory by a group of grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) actively preying on, and consuming, numerous (> 20) cicadas (Psaltoda sp.) by aerial hunting in southeastern Australia. We conclude that deliberate insectivory is likely an evolved and fixed component of the grey-headed flying fox’s dietary ecology, and suggest that this may be an adaptation more common among pteropodid bats than previously thought.",

We present the first known observations of diurnal activity of Rhinolophus lepidus in forests on Tioman Island, Malaysia, recorded using visual surveys and acoustic monitoring. The bats were flying during the day and at night, and feeding buzzes detected suggest that they were actively foraging during the day. This appears to be a regular phenomenon on Tioman Island. The absence of resident diurnal avian predators that hunt below the forest canopy may account for the diurnal activity of R. lepidus in forests there.",

These parasites belong to the diverse group of malaria parasites, and Polychromophilus presents the only haemosporidian taxon that infects mammalian hosts in tropical as well as in temperate climate zones. This study provides the first information of Polychromophilus parasites in the lesser Asiatic yellow bat (Scotophilus kuhlii) in Thailand, a common vespertilionid bat species distributed in South and Southeast Asia. The gametocyte blood stages of the parasites could not be assigned to a described morphospecies and molecular analysis revealed that these parasites might represent a distinct Polychromophilus species. In contrast to Plasmodium species, Polychromophilus parasites do not multiply in red blood cells and, thus, do not cause the clinical symptoms of malaria. Parasitological and molecular investigation of haemosporidian parasites of wildlife, such as the neglected genus Polychromophilus, will contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of malaria parasites.",

This is only the third published dietary study of the species, considered to have a high conservation priority in Europe. Pond bats’ prey was dominated by non-biting midges (Chironomidae — both imagines and pupae) and caddis flies (Trichoptera). However, the spectrum of prey was relatively broad, with 16 taxa, including 12 recorded for the first time in the diet of M. dasycneme. Frequency of occurrence (O%) of particular taxa varied through the season. O% of caddis flies and non-biting midges in droppings were negatively correlated (rs = -0.75, P < 0.05); exceptionally high O% of caddis flies, being larger (and presumably more profitable) prey, occurred in late June and July, coinciding with high energy demands of lactating females. No evidence of piscivory was revealed.",

When direct observations are impossible, we rely on morphological classification of prey remains, although this is particularly challenging among generalist predators whose faeces contain mixed and degraded prey fragments. In this investigation, we used a polymerase chain reaction and sequence-based technique to identify prey fragments in the guano of the generalist insectivore, the eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis), and evaluate several hypotheses about prey selection and prey defences. The interaction between bats and insects is of significant evolutionary interest because of the adaptive nature of insect hearing against echolocation. However, measuring the successes of predator tactics or particular prey defences is limited because we cannot normally identify these digested prey fragments beyond order or family. Using a molecular approach, we recovered sequences from 89% of the fragments tested, and through comparison to a reference database of sequences, we were able to identify 127 different species of prey. Our results indicate that despite the robust jaws of L. borealis, most prey taxa were softer-bodied Lepidoptera. Surprisingly, more than 60% of the prey species were tympanate, with ears thought to afford protection against these echolocating bats. Moths of the family Arctiidae, which employ multiple defensive strategies, were not detected as a significant dietary component. Our results provide an unprecedented level of detail for the study of predator–prey relationships in bats and demonstrate the advantages which molecular tools can provide in investigations of complex ecological systems and foodweb relationships.",

Animals can achieve omnivory using different strategies, for example opportunistic foraging, or switching between multiple trophic niches.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    The Neotropical bat\n                    Glossophaga soricina\n                    (Pallas, 1766) is a common and widespread species known for nectar feeding, but it also eats fruit and insects. Approaching stationary objects (flowers and fruits) or moving objects (insects) poses different sensory tasks and should require different echolocation behaviours. Here we tested the contrasting hypothesis that\n                    G. soricina\n                    can approach both stationary and moving objects using the same echolocation behaviour, thus feeding at different trophic levels by a single sensory mechanism.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Using\n                    DNA\n                    barcoding, we demonstrate that\n                    G. soricina\n                    eats beetles (Coleoptera), flies (Diptera) and noctuid moths with bat‐detecting ears. Laboratory observations show that\n                    G. soricina\n                    actively hunts for prey so insect consumption does not appear to be opportunistic. After capture, individuals consumed prey while perched and manipulated them with jaw, thumb, wrist and wing movements, but food handling was longer and chewing rate slower than in obligate insectivores.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    In contrast to most insectivorous bats, the echolocation calls of\n                    G. soricina\n                    are of high frequency and low intensity, and\n                    G. soricina\n                    did not produce feeding buzzes when approaching insects. An acoustic model of detection distances shows that its low‐intensity calls fail to trigger the auditory neurons of eared moths, allowing\n                    G. soricina\n                    to overcome auditory prey defences.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Individuals achieved niche flexibility using a unique but generalist behavioural approach rather than employing two different specialist methods. Our findings provide a novel insight into the functional mechanisms of insect capture in\n                    G. soricina\n                    and highlight the importance of considering niche flexibility in classifying trophic links in ecological communities.",

When prey become limiting, predators may travel farther to find preferred food or adjust to existing local resources. When predators are habitat limited, local resource abundance impacts foraging success. We analysed the diet of\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              (little brown bats) from Nova Scotia (eastern Canada) to the Northwest Territories (north‐western Canada). This distribution includes extremes of season length and temperature and encompasses colonies on rural monoculture farms, and in urban and unmodified areas. We recognized nearly 600 distinct species of prey, of which ≈30% could be identified using reference sequence libraries. We found a higher than expected use of lepidopterans, which comprised a range of dietary richness from ≈35% early in the summer to ≈55% by late summer. Diptera were the second largest prey group consumed, representing ≈45% of dietary diversity early in the summer. We observed extreme local dietary variability and variation among seasons and years. Based on the species of insects that were consumed, we observed that two locations support prey species with extremely low pollution and acidification tolerances, suggesting that these are areas without environmental contamination. We conclude that there is significant local population variability in little brown bat diet that is likely driven by seasonal and geographical changes in insect diversity, and that this prey may be a good indicator of environment quality.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Small isolated populations are vulnerable to both stochastic events and the negative consequences of genetic drift. For threatened species, the genetic management of such populations has therefore become a crucial aspect of conservation. Flying foxes (\n              Pteropus\n              spp, Chiroptera) are keystone species with essential roles in pollination and seed dispersal in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Yet many flying fox species are also threatened, having experienced dramatic population declines driven by habitat loss and hunting. The insular Ryukyu flying fox (\n              Pteropus dasymallus\n              ) ranges from the Ryukyu Archipelago of Japan through Taiwan to the northern Philippines and has undergone precipitous population crashes on several islands in recent decades. To assess the population genetic structure and diversity in\n              P. dasymallus\n              , and its likely causes, we analyzed mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA. Both markers showed significant genetic differentiation among most island populations, with mitochondrial haplotypes showing some mixing across the regions, likely reflecting historical colonization and/or dispersal events. In contrast, microsatellite markers showed an overall pattern of isolation by distance; however, this pattern appeared to be driven by the presence of deep ocean trenches between geographically distant populations. Thus, the current distribution of\n              P. dasymallus\n              and its subspecific diversity appear to have arisen through vicariance coupled with a long history of restricted gene flow across oceanic barriers. We conclude that isolated island subgroups should be managed separately, with efforts directed at reducing further declines in genetic diversity.",

The habitats used by each bat were characterized through ground‐truthing, and a spatial distribution model was developed of foraging sites.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  A total of 13,643 valid locations were collected during the study. Our study bats flew approximately 20 km from the roost each night to forage. The maximum distance traveled per night ranged from 6.88–105 km and averaged 28.3 km. Six of the 14 bats visited another roost for at least one night during the study, including one roost located 105 km away.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Most foraging locations were in residential areas (53.7%) followed by plantations (26.6%). Our spatial distribution model confirmed that residential areas were the preferred foraging habitat for\n                    P. lylei\n                    , although our results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of individuals studied.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    : Our findings suggest that the use of residential and agricultural habitats by\n                    P. lylei\n                    may create opportunities for bats to interact with humans and livestock. They also suggest the importance of anthropogenic habitats for conservation of this vulnerable and ecologically important group in Cambodia. Our mapping of the probability of occurrence of foraging sites will help identification of areas where public awareness should be promoted regarding the ecosystem services provided by flying foxes and potential for disease transmission through indirect contact.",

A new type of tent constructed by Peters's tent-making bat (Uroderma bilobatum) using multiple leaves of young Coccoloba manzanillensis and possibly Genipa americana on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, is reported. Bats constructed the conical tent resembling a tepee by severing the midribs of the lowermost leaves farthest from the tree trunk and those of the upper leaves gradually closer to the trunk. As a result, the upper leaves collapsed on top of the leaves directly below and the whole structure became tightly sealed. Bats used most or all leaves (range 6-14) in a tree, starting almost always from the bottommost leaf. The tent was occupied by a single, or occasionally two, adult male(s) hanging from one of the bottom three leaves. The structural ingenuity of the tent plus its sophisticated repair suggests a complex bat behaviour.",

The plant most commonly used for tent construction was Anthurium ravenii (Araceae). Bats create a tent on A. ravenii by severing the basal 2 to 5 lateral nerves at a distance of 5 to 10 mm from the midrib; the entire margin of the leaf then collapses downward to form a pyramid-shaped tent. The number of altered leaves per plant ranges from 1 to 4 with a mean of 2.1. A. watsoni appears to be selecting leaves of medium size and low within the plant. The size, shape, and location of leaves selected is consistent with the hypothesis that tent construction provides bats with roost sites that will be available to them for a long period of time and provides protection from both predators and the elements, thus conveying a selective advantage to the bats.",

Divergence in ﬂowering phenology and selﬁng could also reduce interspeciﬁc crossing between self-compatible species. We investigated ﬂoral traits and visitation rates of pollinators of two sympatric Encholirium species on rocky outcrops to evaluate whether prior knowledge of ﬂoral characters could indicate actual pollinators. Data on ﬂowering phenology, visitation rates and breeding system were used to evaluate reproductive isolation. Flowering phenology overlapped between species, but there were differences in ﬂoral characters, nectar volume and concentration. Several hummingbird species visited ﬂowers of both Encholirium spp., but the endemic bat Lonchophylla bokermanni and an unidentiﬁed sphingid only visited E. vogelii. Pollination treatments demonstrated that E. heloisae and E. vogelii were partially self-compatible, with weak pollen limitation to seed set. Herbivores feeding on inﬂorescences decreased reproductive output of both species, but for E. vogelii the damage was higher. Our results indicate that actual pollinators can be known beforehand through ﬂoral traits, in agreement with pollination syndromes stating that a set of ﬂoral traits can be associated with the attraction of speciﬁc groups of pollinators. Divergence on ﬂoral traits and pollinator assemblage indicate that shifts in pollination strategies contribute to reproductive isolation between these Encholirium species, not divergence on ﬂowering phenology or selﬁng. We suggest that hummingbird pollination might be the ancestral condition in Encholirium and that evolution of bat pollination made a substantial contribution to the diversiﬁcation of this clade.",

We sampled two populations in the Golﬁto Wildlife Refuge and Corcovado National Park, south-western Costa Rica, from June 2003 to March 2005. Most females were pregnant during the months of January and June, and most were lactating in March and July, indicating that this species exhibits seasonal bimodal polyoestry, with the ﬁrst parturition peak occurring in February–March and the second in June–July. Additionally, we observed a postpartum oestrus following the ﬁrst parturition, but not after the second. Females entered oestrus again in November–December and had a gestation period of c. 3 months. A female-biased sex ratio of neonates was observed during the second parturition period, and young were born at 32 and 56% of their mothers’ body mass and length of forearm, respectively. Adult proportions in length of forearm were attained faster than adult proportions in body mass, and sustained ﬂight was only possible after 35 days of age, when pups had achieved 100 and 80% of adult length of forearm and body mass proportions, respectively. Weaning and roosting independence occurred when young were c. 30–40 days old, and young females appeared to remain close to their place of birth, at least for their ﬁrst mating period, whereas adult males were never recaptured near their birth site. In addition, sexual maturity was reached in as little as 3 months in females born during the ﬁrst parturition period, whereas females born during the second birth period in June–July seemed to reach maturity at 6 months of age. Our results show that A. watsoni belongs to the faster lane of the slow–fast continuum of life-history variation in bats, which may be attributed primarily to its roosting and feeding ecology.",

            "abstractNote": "The origin and maintenance of intraspecific variation in vocal signals is important for population divergence and speciation. Where vocalizations are transmitted by vertical cultural inheritance, similarity will reflect co-ancestry, and thus vocal divergence should reflect genetic structure. Horseshoe bats are characterized by echolocation calls dominated by a constant frequency component that is partly determined by maternal imprinting. Although previous studies showed that constant frequency calls are also influenced by some non-genetic factors, it is not known how frequency relates to genetic structure. To test this, we related constant frequency variation to genetic and non-genetic variables in the Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (\n              Rhinolophus monoceros\n              ). Recordings of bats from across Taiwan revealed that females called at higher frequencies than males; however, we found no effect of environmental or morphological factors on call frequency. By comparison, variation showed clear population structure, with frequencies lower in the centre and east, and higher in the north and south. Within these regions, frequency divergence was directional and correlated with geographical distance, suggesting that call frequencies are subject to cultural drift. However, microsatellite clustering analysis showed that broad differences in constant frequency among populations corresponded to discontinuities in allele frequencies resulting from vicariant events. Our results provide evidence that the processes shaping genetic subdivision have concomitant consequences for divergence in echolocation call frequency.",

            "abstractNote": "Intraspecific phylogenies can provide useful insights into how populations have been shaped by historical and contemporary processes. Taiwan formed around 5 million years ago from tectonic uplift, and has been connected to mainland Asia several times since its emergence. A central mountain range runs north to south, bisecting the island, and potentially impedes gene flow along an east–west axis. The Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros) is endemic to Taiwan, where it is found mainly at low altitude. To determine the population structure and the demographic and colonization history of this species, we examined variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region in 203 bats sampled at 26 sites. We found very high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, which decreased from the centre to the south and north. Population differentiation followed a pattern of isolation by distance, though most regional genetic variance was attributable to differences between the relatively isolated southern population and those from other regions. A haplotype network was consistent with these findings and also suggested a southward colonization, followed by subsequent secondary contact between the south and other regions. Mismatch distributions were used to infer a past population expansion predating the last glacial maximum, and a neighbour-joining tree showed that R. monoceros formed a monophyletic grouping with respect to its sister taxa. Taken together, our results suggest that this taxon arose from a single period of colonization, and that demographic growth followed in the late Pleistocene. Current genetic structure reflects limited gene flow, probably coupled with stepwise colonization in the past. We consider explanations for the persistence of the species through multiple glacial maxima.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Insectivorous bats are particularly susceptible to heat loss due to their relatively large surface area to volume ratio. Therefore, to maintain a high normothermic body temperature, bats require large amounts of energy for thermoregulation. This can be energetically challenging for small bats during cold periods as heat loss is augmented and insect prey is reduced. To conserve energy many bats enter a state of torpor characterized by a controlled reduction of metabolism and body temperature in combination with selecting roosts based upon thermal properties. Our study aimed to quantify torpor patterns and roost preferences of free-ranging little forest bats (Vespadelus vulturnus) during winter to identify physiological and behavioral mechanisms used by this species for survival of the cold season. All bats captured were male (body mass 4.9 ± 0.7 g, n = 6) and used torpor on every day monitored, with bouts lasting up to 187.58 h (mean = 35.5 ± 36.7 h, n = 6, total number of samples [N] = 61). Torpor bout duration was significantly correlated with daily minimum and maximum ambient temperature, mean skin temperature, insect mass, and body mass of individuals and the multiday torpor bouts recorded in the cold qualify as hibernation. The lowest skin temperature recorded was 5.2°C, which corresponded to the lowest ambient temperature measurement of −5.8°C. Most bats chose tall, large, live Eucalyptus trees for roosting and to leave their roost for foraging on warmer days. Many individuals often switched roosts (every 3–5 days) and movements increased as spring approached (every 1–2 days). Our data suggest that V. vulturnus are capable of using the environmental temperature to gauge potential foraging opportunities and as a cue to reenter torpor when conditions are unsuitable. Importantly, frequent use of torpor and appropriate roost selection form key roles in the winter survival of these tiny bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats can be phylogenetically classified into three major groups: pteropodids, rhinolophoids, and yangochiropterans. While rhinolophoids and yangochiropterans are capable of laryngeal echolocation, pteropodids lack this ability. Delicate ear movements are essential for echolocation behavior in bats with laryngeal echolocation. Caudal auricular muscles, especially the cervicoauricularis group, play a critical role in such ear movements. Previously, caudal auricular muscles were studied in three species of bats with laryngeal echolocation, but to our knowledge, there have been no studies on non-laryngeal echolocators, the pteropodids. Here, we describe the gross anatomy of the cervicoauricularis muscles and their innervation in Cynopterus sphinx by using diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography and 3D reconstructions of immunohistochemically stained serial sections. A previous study on bats with laryngeal echolocation reported that rhinolophoids have four cervicoauricularis muscles and yangochiropterans have three. We observed three cervicoauricularis muscles in the pteropodid C. sphinx. The number of cervicoauricularis muscles and their innervation pattern were comparable to those of non-bat boreoeutherian mammals and yangochiropterans, suggesting that pteropodids, and yangochiropterans maintain the general condition of boreoeutherian mammals and that rhinolophoids have a derived condition. The unique nomenclature had been previously applied to the cervicoauricularis muscles of bats with laryngeal echolocation, but given the commonality between non-bat laurasiatherians and bats, with the exception of rhinolophoids, maintaining the conventional nomenclature (i.e., M. cervicoauricularis superficialis, M. cervicoauricularis medius, and M. cervicoauricularis profundus) is proposed for bats.",

To investigate the molecular link between circadian and hibernating rhythms in the greater tube-nosed bats, Murina leucogaster, we set out to identify circadian genes that are expressed in bats, with specific focus on the PAS domain by using PCR-based screens. We could isolate a cDNA clone, designated as LPAS1, that encodes a protein of 521 amino acid residues. LPAS1 is closely related with CLOCK family with the highest homology to human CLOCK. Based on RT-PCR analyses, LPAS1 transcripts are ubiquitously present in tissues from both summer active and winter dormant periods. Given that LPAS1 is a member of the bHLH-PAS protein superfamily but lacks polyglutamine transactivation domains, it is likely to function as a repressor for endogenous CLOCK to hinder its roles in promoting transcription. Our result will open a new avenue to further examine the functional interconnection between the circadian clock and the circannual clock such as mammalian hibernation.",

Ultrasonic calls with fundamental frequencies between 15–42 kHz were identified as seven categories of infant development calls and 15 categories of adult ultrasonic social calls according to the frequency and duration of the fundamental, the number of harmonics and the number of calls in a sequence. Activities were monitored remotely using infrared video cameras with simultaneous time expansion sound recorders. Distinctive polyharmonic isolation calls of newborn R. hipposideros enabled timing of births to be determined and infant echolocation marked the time when they started to fly. Trill advertisement calls in the hibernaculum indicated mating behaviour in October. Comparison of call-triggered recording times enabled variable levels of activity to be determined quickly. The longest sonogram times were in July (50.2 min/h) and in June (49.1 min/h). During these recordings, 95 and 90 adults returned to the roost after foraging and there were 16 and 42 babies, respectively. In May sound and video recordings outside a nursery roost revealed ultrasonic social calls during the emergence of 200 adult R. hipposideros when the light level was low at two lux, which showed that R. hipposideros were engaged in social activity, not light sampling. Surveys of ten nursery roosts showed that this social behaviour was typical of R. hipposideros in Wales.",

            "abstractNote": "With up to 137 species worldwide, Myotis,— a genus of small, insectivorous bats are an example for understanding biogeographic and evolutionary processes such as intercontinental colonization, diversification, speciation, and convergent adaptive evolution. Species limits and associated distributions, however, remain poorly delineated across significant portions of this diverse group and encompassing a vast geographic range. Here, we explore how diversity is partitioned across this radiation with a focus on Neotropical species of Myotis, using a barcoding approach (706 bp of the mitochondrial DNA gene cytochrome-b) that includes 544 individual sequences (116 newly generated sequences and 428 sequences from GenBank, including outgroups). Single-locus molecular barcoding is useful for identifying cryptic diversity and establishing hypotheses that can guide investigations of species boundaries and phylogenetic relationships, an especially important initial step in assessing poorly characterized, diverse clades. The global phylogeny produced from these data is consistent with the hypothesized monophyly of the New World clade and places the evolutionary relationships of Neotropical species of Myotis within the context of the Palearctic and Nearctic clades. We then explore species boundaries for 25 of the 36 nominal species of Neotropical Myotis, using 3 alternative species delimitation approaches (1 distance-based ABGD [Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery]; and 2 coalescent-based mPTP [multi-rate Poisson Tree Processes], GMYC [Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent] model). The mPTP (n = 29 species) and ABGD (n = 26) approaches inferred different numbers of species than that recognized by current Neotropical Myotis taxonomy, whereas GMYC (n = 25) inferred the same number of species. In addition to the original 36 Neotropical nominal species currently recognized, we suggest that taxonomic revisions are needed to assess whether M. oxyotus gardneri and M. nigricans osculatii should be elevated to the species level and whether M. dinellii is distinct from M. levis. With the 7 potentially cryptic species identified herein that require further study, the number of Neotropical Myotis may approach 45 species. Taken together, our results suggest that rather than a classic example of a temperate radiation, there may be more species of Myotis in the Neotropics than Nearctic, Afrotropic, Indomalayan, and Oceanian Realms, with only the Palearctic region showing higher species richness.",

It is crucial to elucidate how human activities alter gene flow and what are the consequences for the genetic structure of a species. We studied two lineages of the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) throughout the contact zone between mesic and arid Ecozones in the Middle East to evaluate the species’ response to the growing proportion of human-altered habitats in the desert. We integrated population genetics, morphometrics and movement ecology to analyse population structure, morphological variation and habitat use from GPS- or radio-tagged individuals from both desert and Mediterranean areas. We classified the spatial distribution and environmental stratification by describing physical–geographical conditions and land cover. We analysed this information to estimate patch occupancy and used an isolation-by-resistance approach to model gene flow patterns. Our results suggest that lineages from desert and Mediterranean habitats, despite their admixture, are isolated by environment and by adaptation supporting their classification as ecotypes. We found a positive effect of human-altered habitats on patch occupancy and habitat use of fruit bats by increasing the availability of roosting and foraging areas. While this commensalism promotes the distribution of fruit bats throughout the Middle East, gene flow between colonies has not been altered by human activities. This discrepancy between habitat use and gene flow patterns may, therefore, be explained by the breeding system of the species and modifications of natal dispersal patterns.",

This article explores coronavirus infection in three bat species (Tadarida brasiliensis, Eumops bonariensis, and Molossus molossus) of the family Molossidae from Argentina using whole viral metagenome analysis. Fecal samples of 47 bats from three semiurban or highly urbanized areas of the province of Santa Fe were investigated. After viral particle enrichment, total RNA was sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq 550 instrument; the reads were assembled into contigs and taxonomically and phylogenetically analyzed. Three novel complete Alphacoronavirus (AlphaCoV) genomes (Tb1–3) and two partial sequences were identified in T. brasiliensis (Tb4–5), and an additional four partial sequences were identified in M. molossus (Mm1–4). Phylogenomic analysis showed that the novel AlphaCoV clustered in two different lineages distinct from the 15 officially recognized AlphaCoV subgenera. Tb2 and Tb3 isolates appeared to be variants of the same virus, probably involved in a persistent infectious cycle within the T. brasiliensis colony. Using recombination analysis, we detected a statistically significant event in Spike gene, which was reinforced by phylogenetic tree incongruence analysis, involving novel Tb1 and AlphaCoVs identified in Eptesicus fuscus (family Vespertilionidae) from the U.S. The putative recombinant region is in the S1 subdomain of the Spike gene, encompass­ ing the potential receptor-binding domain of AlphaCoVs. This study reports the first AlphaCoV genomes in molossids from the Americas and provides new insights into recombination as an important mode of evolution of coronaviruses involved in crossspecies transmission.",

Coronaviruses (CoV) have been detected in pteropodid bats from several Southeast Asian countries, but little is known about coronaviruses in the Indonesian archipelago in proportion to its mammalian biodiversity. In this study, we screened pooled faecal samples from the Indonesian colonies of Pteropus vampyrus with unbiased next-generation sequencing. Bat CoVs related to Rousettus leschenaultii CoV HKU9 and Eidolon helvum CoV were detected. The 121 faecal samples were further screened using a conventional hemi-nested pan-coronavirus PCR assay. Three positive samples were successfully sequenced, and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the presence of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses. CoVs belonging to the subgenera Nobecovirus, Decacovirus and Pedacovirus were detected in a single P. vampyrus roost. This study expands current knowledge of coronavirus diversity in Indonesian flying foxes, highlighting the need for longitudinal surveillance of colonies as continuing urbanization and deforestation heighten the risk of spillover events.",

In vitro systems for studying bat host–pathogen interactions are of signiﬁcant interest. Here, we establish protocols to generate bat airway organoids (AOs) and airway epithelial cells diﬀerentiated at the air–liquid interface (ALI-AECs) from tracheal tissues of the cave-nectar bat Eonycteris spelaea. In particular, we describe steps which enable laboratories that do not have access to live bats to perform extended experimental work upon procuring an initial batch of bat primary airway tissue. Complete mucociliary diﬀerentiation required treatment with IL-13. E. spelaea ALI-AECs supported productive infection with PRV3M, an orthoreovirus for which Pteropodid bats are considered the reservoir species. However, these ALI-AECs did not support SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite E. spelaea ACE2 receptor being capable of mediating SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus entry. This work provides critical model systems for assessing bat speciesspeciﬁc virus susceptibility and the reservoir likelihood for emerging infectious agents.",

The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses indicated a suture zone similar to those recorded in other animal species, including bats, suggesting the association of more than one refugium with the region. Contrary to most of the other species where a suture zone was seen in Anatolia, for\n              M. capaccinii\n              the geographical location of the genetic break was in south‐eastern Europe. This mitochondrial differentiation was not reflected in the nuclear microsatellites, however, suggesting that the lack of contact during the ice ages did not result in reproductive isolation. Hence taxonomically, the two mitochondrial clades cannot be treated as separate species.",

Despite the great morphological diversity in Chiroptera, the hindlimbs morphology and its postnatal development have been poorly studied. Postnatal development of hindlimbs in Noctilio leporinus is described, further comparing the morphology of adults with that of Noctilio albiventris and previously reported species (Desmodus rotundus, Artibeus lituratus, Molossus molossus). The ossification ending sequence at autopodium elements of N. leporinus does not follow the distal to proximal directional sequence described for D. rotundus, exhibiting a heterochronic delayed ossification ending for the digits of N. leporinus regarding other hindlimb elements, associated with the bigger relative autopodium size of this fisher bat regarding other bat species. Noctilionid bats share the same adult hindlimb bone morphology, except for differences at hindlimb proportions and calcar ossification degree. There are differences in the number and position of bony processes, slots and sesamoids of adult noctilionid fisher bats regarding previously reported species; most differences are concentrated at the autopodium and are related to an increased surface for muscular insertion and the structural support of claws. These facts seem to be closely associated with functional demands of the feeding strategy of noctilionid fisher bats.",

Cystidicola cristivomeri White, 1941 is considered a synonym of C. stigmatura. Cystidicola stigmatura is distinguished from the only other species in the genus, namely C. farionis Fischer, 1798, by the presence of lateral lobes on the eggs rather than filaments. A neotype of F. stigmatura is designated. Cystidicola stigmatura has not been found in fishes in the Great Lakes since 1925. The parasite was found in museum specimens of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) collected before 1925, suggesting that the species became rare or disappeared with the decline of lake trout in these lakes.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n          Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot that is facing rapid rates of deforestation, habitat destruction and poverty. Urgent action is required to document the status of biodiversity to facilitate efficacious conservation plans. Within country, new generations of Malagasy scientists and conservationists are taking on leadership roles, although many lack access to modern genetic sequencing and are underrepresented in academic publications, when compared to international counterparts.\n          \n            With the recent advent of portable and affordable genetic technologies, it is now possible to tackle logistical considerations. Mobile genetics labs, with the capacity for\n            in situ\n            DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing, can produce scientifically reproducible data under field conditions, minimizing the time between sample collection and data analysis. Additionally, mobile labs offer powerful training opportunities for in-country scientists that enable local students and researchers to actively participate and contribute fully to the research enterprise, and that further empower these communities to contribute to the conservation dialog.\n          \n          \n            Here, we show “proof of concept” by deploying a miniaturized thermal cycler alongside the Oxford Nanopore MinION DNA sequencer in Madagascar, including in the newly established Anjajavy Protected Area in northwestern Madagascar. We successfully extracted DNA from tissue samples collected using minimally-invasive techniques, amplified and sequenced a phylogenetically informative mitochondrial gene (cytochrome-b;\n            cytb\n            ), and thereby confirmed the presence of Danfoss’ mouse lemur (\n            M. danfossi\n            ) within the Anjajavy Reserve.\n          \n          \n            To demonstrate the reproducibility of our methods, we successfully performed our established molecular and analytical pipeline at two additional locations in Madagascar, where we also conducted two-day workshops at local higher-education Institutions to demonstrate the process from tissue samples to DNA sequencing. Ultimately, we show that a mobile genetics lab can provide reliable and expeditious results, become a powerful educational tool, and allow scientists to conduct genetic analyses, potentially allowing for rapid interventions under emergency conditions\n            in situ\n            .",

Illegal trade in live European eel and its products is still occurring to satisfy the high demand around the world. Law enforcement officers face the challenge of identifying both live and processed European eel in a timely fashion to detain shipments and prosecute smugglers. Here, we describe the development of a reliable, field‐based, fast, and cost‐effective real‐time polymerase chain reaction assay to detect European eels in trade. This novel assay was applied in a real law enforcement scenario, where positive results provided enough evidence to detain the shipment for more robust forensic analysis, leading to the first prosecution of eel smuggling in Hong Kong. Our approach could serve as a model for the development of other rapid and cost‐effective tools to detect illegal wildlife trade where visual identification fails to provide enough evidence for prosecution. It could also enhance monitoring and enforcement of laws intended to protect highly traded and threatened species.",

The newly recognized species is characterized by the presence of a subterminal hexagonal oral opening with 24 triangular and prominent denticles of the same shape and size and a buccal capsule with 3 oesophageal teeth with jagged edges. The male has a robust body covered with 40 to 43 pairs of subventral cuticular spines, a coiled tail with thin caudal alae, 10 pairs of papillae, and a single, precloacal, semicircular cuticular fan on the ventral surface. The first pair of precloacal papillae are composed of 2 short pedunculated papillae, a feature that seems to be unique to P. (P.) andyraicola when compared to other species of the subgenus Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines). Equal spicules and the cone-shaped gubernaculum poorly sclerotized. The female has a robust body, thinner in the anterior portion, covered by 2 rows of 67 to 80 cuticular spines, of which the first 41 to 43 pairs are anterior to the vulvar opening and symmetrically arranged, which is in contrast to the asymmetrical disposition of the postvulvar spines. This is the 15th species in the genus described from mammals in the Neotropical ecozone and the third parasitizing bats in this biogeographic region.",

            "abstractNote": "Studies on functional performance are important to understand the processes responsible for the evolution of diversity. Morphological trait variation within species inﬂuences the energetic cost of locomotion and impacts life history traits, with ecological and evolutionary consequences. This study examined wing morphology correlates of ﬂight performance measured by energetic expenditure in the Seba’s short-tailed bat, Carollia perspicillata. In the ﬂight experiments, nature caught bats (59 females, 57 males) were allowed to ﬂy for 3 min in a room. After each ﬂight, thermographic images were taken to measure body temperature, and biophysical models were used to calculate sensible heat loss as a measure of energetic expenditure. Wing morphological traits were measured for each individual and associated with heat loss and power required to ﬂy on performance surfaces. Wing morphological traits explained 7–10% of ﬂight energetic cost, and morphologies with the best performance would save the energy equivalent to 9–30% of total daily requirements. The optimal performance areas within the C. perspicillata morphospace were consistent with predicted selection trends from the literature. A trade-off between demands for ﬂight speed and maneuverability was observed. Wing loading and camber presented sexual dimorphism. These morphological differences are likely associated with more economical but less maneuverable ﬂight in females, leading them to ﬂy more often in open areas along the forest edge. Our ﬁndings demonstrate how small scale changes in wing morphology can affect life history strategies and ﬁtness.",

It has not been documented in the southeast US on bats captured outside caves or on the landscape in summer. We collected 136 skin swabs from 10 species of bats captured at 20 sites on the Tennessee side of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 12 May–16 August 2015. Three swabs were found positive for P. destructans, one from a male tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) and two from male big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). This detection of P. destructans on freeflying male bats in the southeast US during summer has potential repercussions for the spread of the fungus to novel bat species and environments. Our finding emphasizes the need to maintain rigorous year-round decontamination of field clothing and equipment until more is understood about the viability of P. destructans found on bats captured outside hibernacula during summer, about the potential for males to act as reservoirs of the fungus, and the risk of fungal transmission and spread.",

As the process of spermatogenesis is under hormonal control, mainly of pituitary and androgen hormones, our aim was to analyze the morphological variations and the hormonal control of the testes of E. furinalis during the four phases of its reproductive cycle. Testes of 18 adult males, divided into four sample groups (active, regressing, regressed, and recrudescence phases), were submitted to morphological, morphometric, and immunohistochemical analyzes. The results demonstrate that the processes of testicular regression and recrudescence of E. furinalis are under the control of pituitary, androgen and estrogen hormones. The regulation is exerted mainly through the activation and cross signaling of AR and FSHR in Sertoli cells and of LHR in Leydig cells. The testicular regression appears to be activated by an inhibition/reduction of AR expression in Sertoli cells, which inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of new spermatogonia and causes the deactivation of spermatogenesis. Conversely, the testicular recrudescence occurs by the increasing of the expression of LHR in Leydig cells, and AR and FSHR in Sertoli cells, which reactivates the testicular production of androgens and estrogens, the proliferation of spermatogonia and restarts the spermatogenesis.",

Faecal analysis and pollen collected from the bats’ fur were used to identify the plant species ingested. From 1,155 diet records from 506 samples, at least eleven plant taxa were identified. Individual bats feed on flowers of up to six plant species each night. Parkia spp. (34%) and Musa spp. (28%) have the highest percentage frequency followed by Eugenia spp. (9.4%), Oroxylum indicum (6.4%), Durio zibethinus (6.2%), Ceiba pentandra (5.5%), Sonneratia spp. (5.2%), while Cocos nucifera and an unknown plant species, made up a minor proportion (<2.5%). Parkia and Musa were the main dietary items of E. spelaea in nearly every month, while the remaining components of the diet varied seasonally. Durio spp. is an important contributor to the diet during March–April (39–42%). The results from pollen collected from fur generally corresponded with those from faecal analysis, but Musa spp. had a higher percentage frequency on the fur (34%) than Parkia spp. (23%). The dawn return patterns of the bats to their roosts differ significantly between sexes. Most mature males return early in the night while most females return at dawn. Earlier returning males were significantly heavier than those returning later. This return pattern is similar to that reported during the breeding period for those polygynous fruit bats that maintain a harem. Thus, these results suggest that E. spelaea may exhibit a resource-defence polygynous mating system.",

            "abstractNote": "A new maternity colony of lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros) was found and described in an abandoned building in Aljezur, Portugal. Between June 25 and July 4, 2022, we conducted emergence and juvenile counts, took light intensity measurements during emergence times and evaluated microclimatic conditions inside the roost, namely temperature and relative humidity. Moreover, we took ultrasound recordings in the open and performed transects to locate foraging areas and commuting corridors. We found the colony amounted to at least 501 individuals (371 adults and 130 juveniles), currently the largest known in Portugal and one of the biggest in Europe. Sixteen matching echolocation calls were recorded away from the colony near a water reservoir, a probable foraging area together with the Vale da Telha valley connecting the roost to the water body, which may also serve as a commuting corridor. Considering the threatened conservation status of the lesser horseshoe bat, the large colony size and its lack of protection, we proposed several conservation measures aimed at preserving the colony. We hope our recommendations will be included in the management plan currently being prepared for the Natura 2000 site Costa Sudoeste. Following up on this research, a radio-tracking study would definitively confirm the bats’ movements and foraging grounds.",

Here, I review the social structure and mating systems of 4 nominal species in the Old World fruit bat genus Cynopterus, and explore the relationship between roosting ecology, the size and stability of female groups, and variation in degree of polygyny. Intraspeciﬁc comparisons for C. brachyotis Sunda and C. sphinx suggest that the distribution and availability of suitable roost sites has a strong inﬂuence on the dispersion of females among males. Examination of paternity data for C. sphinx demonstrates a direct relationship between the environmental potential for polygyny and variance in male reproductive success: a 2-fold increase in mean harem size due to reduction in roost availability produces a 2-fold increase in reproductive skew among males. However, in C. brachyotis Sunda, C. sphinx, and C. horsﬁeldii, low ﬁdelity of females to roosts or males is consistent, regardless of roost dispersion or permanence. In contrast, female C. brachyotis Forest exhibit high short-term ﬁdelity to males, despite low roost ﬁdelity. It is proposed that female lability is inﬂuenced by the distribution of potential mates and the beneﬁts of multiple mating and, in C. brachyotis Sunda and C. sphinx, is likely to promote both behavioral and cryptic female choice, and male sperm competition.",

            "abstractNote": "Although the use of modiﬁed roosts has been reported in more than 20 species of bats in the tropics, comparative studies of the roosting ecology of congeneric tent-roosting species are notably lacking. In the Paleotropics, this unique behavior has been described in two species belonging to the genus, Cynopterus: C. sphinx and C. brachyotis. However, it is not known whether tent roosting is an essential component of their roosting ecology, or whether the behavior is found in other members of the genus. In this study we characterize the roosting ecology of four sympatric species of Cynopterus in peninsular Malaysia and use these data to address two main questions. (1) Do all four species use modiﬁed roosts and, in those that do, is tent-roosting obligate or opportunistic? (2) Do species pairs overlap in roost preferences and roosting habitat and, if so, is there evidence for interspeciﬁc interactions in relation to these resources? We radio-tracked bats at two ﬂoristically distinct sites and located a total of 249 roosts. Interspeciﬁc roost niche overlap was minimal at both sites and we found no evidence for interspeciﬁc competition for roost resources at the local level. Species differences in roosting ecology were deﬁned primarily by spatial separation of roosting habitats and secondarily by within-habitat differences in roost selection. Importantly, we found that although periodic use of modiﬁed roosts was a characteristic shared by all four species, most roosts were unmodiﬁed, indicating that tent roosting is a facultative behavior in Malaysian Cynopterus.",

            "abstractNote": "The extent to which response to environmental change is mediated by species-specific ecology is an important aspect of the population histories of tropical taxa. During the Pleistocene glacial cycles and associated sea level fluctuations, the Sunda region in Southeast Asia experienced concurrent changes in landmass area and the ratio of forest to open habitat, providing an ideal setting to test the expectation that habitat associations played an important role in determining species’ response to the opportunity for geographic expansion. We used mitochondrial control region sequences and six microsatellite loci to compare the phylogeographic structure and demographic histories of four broadly sympatric species of Old World fruit bats in the genus, Cynopterus. Two forest-associated species and two open-habitat generalists were sampled along a latitudinal transect in Singapore, peninsular Malaysia, and southern Thailand. Contrary to expectations based on habitat associations, the geographic scale of population structure was not concordant across ecologically similar species. We found evidence for long and relatively stable demographic history in one forest and one open-habitat species, and inferred non-coincident demographic expansions in the second forest and open-habitat species. Thus, while these results indicate that Pleistocene climate change did not have a single effect on population structure across species, a correlation between habitat association and response to environmental change was supported in only two of four species. We conclude that interactions between multiple factors, including historical and contemporary environmental change, species-specific ecology and interspecific interactions, have shaped the recent evolutionary histories of Cynopterus fruit bats in Southeast Asia.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging infectious disease of hibernating bats linked to the death of an estimated 5.7 million or more bats in the northeastern United States and Canada. White-nose syndrome is caused by the cold-loving fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), which invades the skin of the muzzles, ears, and wings of hibernating bats. Previous work has shown that WNS-affected bats arouse to euthermic or near euthermic temperatures during hibernation significantly more frequently than normal and that these too-frequent arousals are tied to severity of infection and death date. We quantified the behavior of bats during these arousal bouts to understand better the causes and consequences of these arousals. We hypothesized that WNS-affected bats would display increased levels of activity (especially grooming) during their arousal bouts from hibernation compared to WNS-unaffected bats. Behavior of both affected and unaffected hibernating bats in captivity was monitored from December 2010 to March 2011 using temperature-sensitive dataloggers attached to the backs of bats and infrared motion-sensitive cameras. The WNS-affected bats exhibited significantly higher rates of grooming, relative to unaffected bats, at the expense of time that would otherwise be spent inactive. Increased self-grooming may be related to the presence of the fungus. Elevated activity levels in affected bats likely increase energetic stress, whereas the loss of rest (inactive periods when aroused from torpor) may jeopardize the ability of a bat to reestablish homeostasis in a number of physiologic systems.",

            "abstractNote": "Information about the population genetic structures of parasites is important for an understanding of parasite transmission pathways and ultimately the co-evolution with their hosts. If parasites cannot disperse independently of their hosts, a parasite’s population structure will depend upon the host’s spatial distribution. Geographical barriers affecting host dispersal can therefore lead to structured parasite populations. However, how the host’s social system affects the genetic structure of parasite populations is largely unknown. We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to describe the spatio-temporal population structure of a contact-transmitted parasitic wing mite (Spinturnix bechsteini) and compared it to that of its social host, the Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii). We observed no genetic differentiation between mites living on different bats within a colony. This suggests that mites can move freely among bats of the same colony. As expected in case of restricted inter-colony dispersal, we observed a strong genetic differentiation of mites among demographically isolated bat colonies. In contrast, we found a strong genetic turnover between years when we investigated the temporal variation of mite haplotypes within colonies. This can be explained with mite dispersal occuring between colonies and bottlenecks of mite populations within colonies. The observed absence of isolation by distance could be the result from genetic drift and ⁄ or from mites dispersing even between remote bat colonies, whose members may meet at mating sites in autumn or in hibernacula in winter. Our data show that the population structure of this parasitic wing mite is influenced by its own demography and the peculiar social system of its bat host.",

Here we present sequences of the mitochondrial control region obtained from 16 localities in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and NW Romania. From the 97 sequences, 87 were identical with the haplotype H1, the most frequent one of haplogroup A occurring throughout Western Europe, and nine sequences (eight haplotypes) differed from H1 only by one substitution. This confirms decrease of genetic variability from south to north and colonisation of Central Europe from the Iberian Peninsula. However, we found a new haplotype, which is closely related to sequences from haplogroup D so far described in the nominative form of this species only from Greece and Bulgaria, which suggests two possible scenarios. First, colonization route from the Balkan refugium existed in this species as well, which is supported also by recently published analyses of historical DNA. Second, the Balkan haplotype entered Central Europe via interspecific hybridisation with M. blythii, a species, in which the haplogroup D is the most frequent in Europe and which is known to have colonised Europe from south-east.",

Here, we present evidence of male gamete-mediated gene ﬂow resulting from extra-group mating in Spix’s disc-winged bat, Thyroptera tricolor, a species which demonstrates all-offspring philopatry. We used microsatellite and capture–recapture data to characterize social group structure and the distribution of mated pairs at two sites in southwestern Costa Rica over four breeding seasons. Relatedness and genetic spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated strong kinship within groups and over short distances (<50 m), resulting from matrilineal group structure and small roosting home ranges (~0.2 ha). Despite high relatedness among-group members, observed inbreeding coefﬁcients were low (FIS = 0.010 and 0.037). Parentage analysis indicated mothers and offspring belonged to the same social group, while fathers belonged to different groups, separated by large distances (~500 m) when compared to roosting home ranges. Simulated random mating indicated mate choice was not based on intermediate levels of relatedness, and mated pairs were less related than adults within social groups on average. Isolation-by-distance (IBD) models of genetic neighbourhood area based on father–offspring distances provided direct estimates of mean gamete dispersal distances (^r) > 10 roosting home range equivalents. Indirect estimates based on genetic distance provided even larger estimates of ^r, indicating direct estimates were biased low. These results suggest extra-group mating reduces the incidence of inbreeding in T. tricolor, and male gamete dispersal facilitates gene ﬂow in lieu of natal dispersal of young.",

The relative frequency of type D social calls increased, when more than one individual of P. pipistrellus was present, compared to one individual. The data confirm the assumption that one function of social calls is repelling conspecifics (food patch defence hypothesis). In the presence of other species of the genus Pipistrellus or of other genera, the mean social call rate did not significantly increase, except when P. pygmaeus was present. Hence, social call production as a food patch defence typically is not significantly influenced by interspecific interactions. This directs to niche separation concerning the foraging mode of different species. The closely related species P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus may compete for resources and communicate by type D social calls. Pipistrelles are known to use a series of type D social calls during songflights. For instance, males use this calling behaviour to attract females and repel competing males. During the mating season P. pipistrellus produced social calls more frequently when other pipistrelle species were absent. This shows that interspecific recognition may influence the mating behaviour of P. pipistrellus. Competing for non-food resources like mating roosts may cause bats to keep calm in the presence of other species.",

Our aim was to compare the general ovary morphology and the folliculogenesis process in these species to increase the knowledge about the reproductive diversity of tropical bats. We observed a morphological distinction between the ovaries of both species: A. planirostris presents the primordial follicles located in a cranial portion of the ovary and the interstitial gland cells are not distinctive, while in E. furinalis, the primordial follicles are located throughout the cortex, and there is an abundance of interstitial gland cells. Both species present binovular or triovular follicles. Artibeus planirostris is a monovular species, with a preferential ovulation in the left side. Some females of E. furinalis exhibited two corpora lutea in the same ovary, and others presented a corpus luteum in both right and left ovaries at the same time; thus, E. furinalis is a polyovular species. Our results express the variation between two Neotropical species, reflecting the great variation in the reproductive aspects in Chiroptera.",

The Hoary Bat was not previously kno from Alaska, but we recorded 25 call files of this species (of 26,151 low frequency bat files) sites in northern Southeast Alaska (4 mainland sites and 1 site on Chichagof Island); an addit 110 call files were classified as probable Hoary Bat, but were ambiguous. We recorded 307 files that contained echolocation calls diagnostic of Silver-haired Bats; no files had character diagnostic of Big Brown Bats. The rest of the low frequency recordings were identified probable Silver-haired Bat calls, although Big Brown Bats cannot be ruled out due to extensive overlap of acoustic characteristics between these 2 species. We recorded Hoary almost exclusively during the autumn migration period. By contrast, Silver-haired Bats w detected throughout the summer active season, indicating at least some individuals are resid in Southeast Alaska. Silver-haired Bat activity was greatest at sites on or near the mainland, w most sites showing peaks of activity in spring, suggesting bats from the interior ma overwintering in the region. Winter recordings suggest Silver-haired Bats (and Big Brown Ba present) are active to some extent during winter in Southeast Alaska. Understanding distribution and seasonality of Hoary and Silver-haired Bat activity in Southeast Alaska critical 1st step toward identifying their habitat requirements and conservation needs in region.",

Few published accounts describe physical altercations among bats, but Hoary Bats are frequently involved. Rabies is often implicated as a driving factor in the aggressive interactions. We decided not to euthanize the bat for rabies testing, but encourage others who encounter these types of interactions to have bats tested.",

The choice of specific\n              Heliconia\n              leaves for tents was predicted on the basis of leaf size and age. Additionally, tents in shrubs, saplings and epiphytic plants were found scattered throughout both primary‐ and secondary‐growth forest. Tents were used either as night feeding roosts or as day‐roosts for as long as 45 days. Groups of bats remained together when they moved to newly cut tents. After parturition, tent groups divided into all‐male colonies and maternity colonies with females, non‐volant young and a single adult male.",

            "abstractNote": "The small population and limited range of the Samoan ¯ying fox Pteropus samoensis has generated concern regarding the survival of this large, diurnally active bat. During 1995±96, surveys were conducted monthly in six study valleys on Tutuila Island, American Samoa, to assess population size. The amount of diurnal and nocturnal activity was investigated to gauge the accuracy of diurnal surveys, and territorial behaviours were observed to determine how they in¯uenced local dispersion. Individuals showed long-term ®delity to a series of roosts and small core areas that were used both nocturnally and diurnally. Territorial defence was observed only of temporary feeding territories in fruiting or ¯owering trees. Bats defended food resources by aerial patrols and extended aerial chases in which intruders were frequently bitten. Foraging movements changed seasonally, with up to 80% of individuals observed bypassing study valleys. The mean density of bats observed within the study valleys was 6.1 bats/km2 (range = 0.9±18.5 bats/km2). Pteropus samoensis were active both nocturnally and diurnally with greatest activity in late afternoon and evening, 16:00±22:00. Because bats were most active at night, it is probable that daytime surveys of ¯ying bats undercount the number of individuals present. Greatest densities were found in valleys that were contiguous with large tracts of forest inaccessible to people. Most observations of roosting bats were of solitary males on dead branches that jutted above the forest canopy, while females and dependant young roosted below the canopy, hidden within vegetation. Adult male±female pairs were rarely seen together other than during the mating period in August±January. The population has increased following a ban on hunting, but reliance on mature forest makes long-term species survival dependant on protection of the limited mature forest remaining and continued hunting restrictions.",

Most studies designed to use a molecular approach for dietary studies of bats suggest that fecal material should be collected within one week of deposit to prevent environmental degradation or contamination. However, Ozark big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) are highly susceptible to human disturbance. The purpose of this study was to performing a molecular dietary analysis of Ozark big-eared bats. Our study detected 40 species representing two orders (Diptera and Lepidoptera) and 11 families of insects and thus, providing new information regarding dietary habits of Ozark big-eared bats.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate phylogenetic relationships within Pteronotus using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial ribosomal and cytochrome b genes and the nuclear Recombination Activating Gene-2 based on likelihood inferential techniques (maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetics). Results of this study present, for the first time, a fully resolved and strongly supported phylogeny for all relationships within Pteronotus. These data strongly support: sister-group relationships between davyi and gymnonotus (subgenus pteronotus), between macleayii and quadridens (subgenus chilonycteris), and between the subgenera pteronotus and chilonycteris. Pteronotus personatus is sister to this clade and P. parnellii is the most basal lineage of Pteronotus. Although this is the first study to provide a fullyresolved and strongly supported hypothesis for the phylogenetic relationships among species of Pteronotus, future work must focus on phylogeographic surveys within each species because previous studies have suggested that parnellii and personatus may contain undescribed species.",

Such seems to be the case of Glossophaga soricina, a generalist, glossophagine bat that is broadly distributed throughout the Neotropics. Several studies have found high levels of molecular variation within G. soricina, suggesting that it could be a cryptic species complex. Here, we explore data derived from two-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of cranial characters and their covariation with environmental variables, aiming to test the existence of more than one species grouped within it and to contribute to the knowledge of its variation and evolutionary history. Variation in shape and size of skull and mandible supports the two main mitochondrial lineages reported in previous studies, one corresponding to the east side of the Andes (subspecies G. s. soricina) and the other one corresponding to populations from Mesoamerica and the west side of the Andes, in turn composed of at least three monophyletic and morphologically differentiated taxa. Environmental variables correlate with shape variation and might be responsible for convergences in shape and size between the species with the smallest distributions. Based on the evidence we present in this work we elevate four subspecies to the taxonomic level of species. The correct names for the species of the analyzed complex are: G. soricina (Pallas 1766), G. mutica Merriam 1898, G. antillarum Rehn 1902, and G. valens Miller 1913.",

We used morphological, morphometric, and genetic analyses to evaluate the taxonomic identity of\n              A. carishina.\n              We performed a principal components analysis to evaluate the correspondence between morphological and taxonomic groups for 260 specimens of large-bodied\n              Anoura\n              (\n              A. carishina\n              ,\n              Anoura geoffroyi\n              ,\n              A. latidens\n              , and\n              Anoura peruana\n              ), and statistically analyzed traits diagnostic for\n              A. latidens\n              , including (1) morphology of the third upper premolar (P\n              4\n              ), (2) size of the second (P\n              3\n              ) and third (P\n              4\n              ) upper premolars, and (3) angle formed by the maxillary toothrows. We find that\n              A. latidens\n              and\n              A. carishina\n              are indistinguishable, and share several characters lacking in\n              A. geoffroyi\n              , including a P\n              4\n              with triangular shape, an under-developed anterobasal cusp in the P\n              3\n              , a smaller braincase, and a shorter rostrum. Phylogenetic analyses using ultra-conserved elements infer that the holotype and two paratype specimens of\n              A. carishina\n              are paraphyletic and nested within\n              A. latidens\n              , while one paratype diagnosable by morphology as\n              A. geoffroyi\n              nests within\n              A. geoffroyi\n              samples. We demonstrate that\n              A. carishina\n              should be considered a junior synonym of\n              A. latidens\n              , updating the distribution of the latter.",

Initial analysis showed that in addition to the echolocation calls at 81–84 kHz there were ultrasound calls at lower frequencies. Simultaneous recordings of ultrasound and low frequency signals (1–10 kHz) showed that echolocation pulses, ultrasound social calls and low frequency social calls were quite distinct in both duration, frequency and number of calls. Twelve types of ultrasound social calls were identified. The majority of calls were in the range 20–29 kHz and 1–49 ms duration. Variability was found in the relative power of the fundamental and harmonics of the calls. This analysis has identified a substantial repertoire of calls used by R. ferrumequinum in a nursery roost colony. The possibility of the use of a male advertisement call in the roost is discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are considered the natural reservoir of numerous emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs). There is a need for immortalized bat cell lines to culture and investigate the pathogenicity, replication kinetics, and evolution of emerging coronaviruses. We illustrate the susceptibility and permissiveness of a spontaneously immortalized kidney cell line (Rhileki) from Blyth’s horseshoe bat (R. lepidus) to SARS-CoV-2 virus, including clinical isolates, suggesting a possible virus-host relationship. We were able to observe limited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Rhileki cells compared with simian VeroE6 cells. Slower viral replication in Rhileki cells was indicated by higher ct values (RT-PCR) at later time points of the viral culture and smaller foci (foci forming assay) compared with those of VeroE6 cells. With this study we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not restricted to R. sinicus and could include more Rhinolophus species. The establishment of a continuous Rhinolophus lepidus kidney cell line allows further characterization of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Rhinolophus bat cells, as well as isolation attempts of other bat-borne viruses.",

Closely related species are E. glaucinus, E. ferox, and E. floridanus. The conceptual basis for the description of this species is the Genetic Species Concept with speciation by the Bateson-Dobzhanzky-Muller model. The new species is distinguished from all other species of bats by its unique karyotype (2N = 38, FN = 54), sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene, and genetic markers revealed through analysis of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms. The series from the type locality (Ecuador, Guayas) is comprised of seven specimens. Morphologically, the new species is smaller than E. floridanus and E. glaucinus, but is indistinguishable from E. ferox. The new species is significantly smaller in size than E. glaucinus in six out of eight measurements and is distinguishable from E. glaucinus based on length of maxillary toothrow and zygomatic breadth. The geographic range of E. wilsoni, as currently documented, is the dry forests of southwestern Ecuador and adjacent northwestern Peru. We propose the common name for this species be Wilson’s bonneted bat.",

In this regard, the Iberian, Italian, Balkan peninsulas and Anatolia comprise important glacial refugia. In different parts of Anatolia, suture zones, where lineages that diverged in the different glacial refugia met again, were observed for several species. In this study, we investigated the mitochondrial genetic differentiation of the greater horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in southeastern Europe and Anatolia. The mitochondrial DNA analyses indicated a suture zone in central Anatolia, similar to those recorded in other animal species, showing the presence of more than one refugium within the region. The time of the split of these lineages that diverged in allopatry was dated to the Pleistocene. However, the location of this suture zone did not coincide with the Sea of Marmara, not supporting a recent hypothesis, based on microsatellite data, which states that this water body might be an impediment to post glacial gene flow in this species.",

Two subspecies previously recognized in Turkey, M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus, differ significantly in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and in morphology. Until now, the distribution records of M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus showed that they were allopatric and hence even though there was clear morphological and genetic differentiation between the two taxa, whether they represented separate species or subspecies was still not determined with certainty. Here we present the first data on syntopic occurrence of both forms in three caves in south-eastern Turkey. We show that the three caves host individuals of both taxa by using mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA and morphometric analyses. These findings provide the final line of evidence to date, for designation of M. s. schreibersii and M. s. pallidus as two separate species, M. schreibersii and M. pallidus. This will raise the number of species in the Eurobats agreement area from 45 to 46.",

A colony of 100–130 individuals, each one with the distinctive external and morphological charac­ teristics of the species, was found roosting in the lower parts of the floor of bungalows located in the Sarapiquí area. The rediscovery of this species validates the protec­ tion of several rainforest fragments through ecotourism, a modern way to balance human development and bio­ diversity conservation.",

Five of the\n              Histoplasma\n              isolates from the bats were subsequently identified as Latin American (LA) clade A, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) class 6. These observations raised concern as to whether the commercially available HAg test could detect\n              Histoplasma\n              antigen not of the North American clade upon which the HAg test had been developed. To evaluate this concern, a murine model of disseminated histoplasmosis was established, and mice were infected with multiple LA\n              Histoplasma\n              isolates, including clinical isolates recovered from Brazilian AIDS patients (RFLP class 5 and class 6) and isolates recovered from the bats during the outbreak (RFLP class 6).\n              Histoplasma\n              antigen was detected in all infected mice in our experiments, even when\n              Histoplasma\n              was not recovered in culture. Because the currently available HAg test is able to detect\n              Histoplasma\n              antigen in mice infected with Latin American isolates, this suggests that bat host factors rather than differences among\n              Histoplasma\n              RFLP classes were responsible for the inability to detect HAg in infected bats.",

Conspecifics may also get attracted towards distress calls as a behaviour of cooperative mobbing or just selfishly assessing the potential source of danger. The exact functions of distress calls in bats therefore vary to a great degree and are very hard to pinpoint. We conducted playback experiments to test the response of short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx towards the distress calls of their conspecifics from related and unrelated sites. Bats were attracted to their conspecifics from both related and unrelated sites and in one occasion towards fruit bat (Rousettus leschenaulti) of another genus within the same family. The response towards the opposite sex was significant in most of the playback trials and the reasons remain unclear. This symmetric response towards conspecifics from related and unrelated sites suggests the possibility of fruit bats building social relationships among unrelated individuals and probably between species.",

The genus consists of 7 species, 4 broadly distributed through the Caribbean and mainland of North and South America, and 3 species limited to the Greater Antilles archipelago. We present a brief review of the taxonomic history, redefine the genus, and consider some questions that remain concerning the biology and systematics of the group. A new species, Cameronieta almaensis n. sp., is described from the wings of Pteronotus parnellii collected from the Serra das Almas Reserve, in the northeastern state of Ceará, Brazil. This is the first record of Cameronieta from Brazil.",

            "abstractNote": "Because of the high risk of going unnoticed, cryptic species represent a major challenge to biodiversity assessments, and this is particularly true for taxa that include many such species, for example, bats. Long-eared bats from the genus Plecotus comprise numerous cryptic species occurring in the Mediterranean Region and present complex phylogenetic relationships and often unclear distributions, particularly at the edge of their known ranges and on islands. Here, we combine Species Distribution Models (SDMs), field surveys and molecular analyses to shed light on the presence of a cryptic long-eared bat species from North Africa, Plecotus gaisleri, on the islands of the Sicily Channel, providing strong evidence that this species also occurs in Europe, at least on the islands of the Western Mediterranean Sea that act as a crossroad between the Old Continent and Africa. Species Distribution Models built using African records of P. gaisleri and projected to the Sicily Channel Islands showed that all these islands are potentially suitable for the species. Molecular identification of Plecotus captured on Pantelleria, and recent data from Malta and Gozo, confirmed the species' presence on two of the islands in question. Besides confirming that P. gaisleri occurs on Pantelleria, haplotype network reconstructions highlighted moderate structuring between insular and continental populations of this species. Our results remark the role of Italy as a bat diversity hotspot in the Mediterranean and also highlight the need to include P. gaisleri in European faunal checklists and conservation directives, confirming the usefulness of combining different approaches to explore the presence of cryptic species outside their known ranges—a fundamental step to informing conservation.",

Mean body mass of pups increased linearly until 23 days, when they achieved 74.29% of the mean mass of adult females (11.28 ± 0.74 g, n = 12). Rates of body mass gain and forearm growth during the early stage of postnatal growth were 0.36 g/day and 1.41 mm/day, respectively. Length of epiphyseal gap increased during the first 3 weeks and subsequently followed by a linear decrease until day 70 when it closed. Wing characteristics increased linearly until the age of the first flight, after which growth rates significantly declined (all p < 0.05). Wing loading decreased linearly (−0.09 Nm−2/ day) until 36 days of age and thereafter increased to a maximum of 6.56 ± 0.30 Nm−2 at 80 days of age. We compare our results with data obtained from close-related bat species, particularly Rhinolophus ­mehelyi previously studied in a nearby area.",

Although many studies have reported die-offs of bats at winter hibernacula, it is important to understand how bat mortality linked to WNS at winter hibernacula affects bat activity levels in their summer ranges. In the summer (May–August) of 2007, 2008 and 2009, we recorded echolocation calls to determine bat activity at sites along the Hudson River, NY (within approx. 100 km of where WNS was first reported). We documented a 78 per cent decline in the summer activity of\n              M. lucifugus\n              , coinciding with the arrival and spread of WNS. We suggest that mortality of\n              M. lucifugus\n              in winter hibernacula is reflected by reduced levels of activity in the summer and that WNS affects the entire bat population of an area, and not only individual hibernacula.",

Outcrossing estimates (tm ¼ 1:07) are consistent with indications that H. courbaril is self-incompatible. Direct estimates of pollen gene ﬂow into two small (n < 6) stands of trees indicate that 42% and 62% of the pollen came from outside the stand. Despite this level of external gene ﬂow, genetic drift is expected to cause divergence of populations over time (migration rate Nem ¼ 0:40 and 0.63), mainly because of the small number of adult trees within each population. Indirect estimates of gene ﬂow based on nine larger populations of 21–48 trees gave estimates of 2.91 migrants per generation, but the absence of migration-drift equilibrium renders this estimate unreliable. Analysis of pollen movement among 21 adult trees indicated that the effective number of fathers was only 6.9, with the majority of pollinations coming from just three trees. Asynchronous ﬂowering, and perhaps restricted use of ﬂowering resources by bats, the primary pollinators of H. courbaril, is the likely cause of this low number. Genetic diversity values based on 31 allozyme loci were lower than those reported for other outcrossing, gravity-dispersed tree species. Few effective fathers, and a relatively low population density, are the likely reasons.",

Here, we report on the predation of a protected species of pipistrelle bat by S. nobilis in Britain. To our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of a Theridiidae spider preying on a bat globally, the first case of a Theridiidae spider preying on a vertebrate in Britain, and the first global case of a Steatoda preying on a mammal.",

            "abstractNote": "Figs (\n              Ficus\n              species) are an important resource for a diverse array of organisms in most tropical forests (Janzen 1979 but see Gautier-Hion & Michaloud 1989). The inflorescence of\n              Ficus\n              , hereafter referred to as the ‘fig’, is an enclosed receptacle lined with unisexual flowers. The flowers of\n              Ficus\n              species are pollinated by wasps that feed on galled fig ovules as larvae and that lay eggs in fig flowers as adults (Weiblen 2002). Ripe figs are consumed by vertebrate frugivores, which are the primary dispersers of fig seeds (Shanahan\n              et al.\n              2001). The interaction between figs, pollinators and frugivores introduces the potential for conflict between the roles of raising fig wasps and dispersing seeds. Specifically, the pollination mutualism could be compromised if frugivores consumed figs containing pollinator larvae. This conflict is resolved in very different ways according to the breeding system of the fig.",

Of 28 pairs of autooomes 4 are metacentric, two of them are small-sized, and 24 are acrocentric. One pair of middle-sized acrocentric autosomes is provided with satellites, and among small elements only one pair is punctiform. The X chromosome is a large submetacentric one: its average centromere index is 2,89. The Y chromosome is small and oblong. A comparison has been made between the karyogram of Rhinolophus mehelyi and those of Rh. ferrumequinum, Rh. euryale, Rh. blasii and Rh. hipposideros. The results speak in favour of the opinion of CAPANNA and CIVITELLI (1964), and CAPANNA, CIVITELLI and CoNTI (1967) on the significance of the morphologically identical chromosomes: their role in the phylogeny of Rhinolophid bats was discussed.",
