            "abstractNote": "Natural and anthropogenic disturbances can strongly impact population dynamics of species and are often responsible for zoonotic emerging infectious diseases. However, long-term studies on the demographic consequences of human disturbances are unusual. We used 6 years (1995–2000) of mark-recapture data to investigate how climatic conditions, human disturbance and density affect sex- and age-speciﬁc apparent survival probabilities of the pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Schreber 1774) in a maternity colony. Our study demonstrated that density played an important role in population dynamics of pipistrelle bat and that its effect differed with respect to age and sex. Notably, human disturbance caused a strong decline of adult female survival, suggesting that perturbations have important consequences in bat-colony dynamics. Juvenile female survival was negatively inﬂuenced by density, being considerably lower in high densities. In contrast, juvenile and adult males were apparently not affected as they had constant survival probabilities. Although climatic factors can markedly affect population dynamics of temperate insectivorous bats, in this study, the weather conditions did not inﬂuence the survival rates of pipistrelle bats. We provide the ﬁrst report that demonstrates the density-dependent effect on bat survival. That is especially relevant to better understanding of the bat-population dynamics and to evaluate the consequences of human disturbance and their potential changes in the maternity colony structure.",

We identiﬁed one order of arachnids (Araneae) and ten orders of insects: Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Orthoptera, Mantodea, Hemiptera, Isoptera, Ephemeroptera, Blattodea and Odonata in a decreasing rank. Coleoptera (31.07%) were Carabidae, Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, Tenebrionidae, Aphodidae, Scarabaeidae, and Histeridae. Hymenoptera (21.31%) were Formicidae, Myrmicidae and Vespidae, Diptera (13.78%) were Culicidae and Tabanidae, and Orthoptera (11.40%) were Acrididae and Gryllidae. The autumn-winter diet (October to December) included a large amount of Odonata, Scarabaeidae, Blattodea, Acrididae and Myrmicidae. The spring-summer diet (February to August) was characterized mainly by Chrysomelidae, Vespidae, Tenebrionidae, Aphodidae and Araneae. As other desert bat species A. tridens displays a combination of opportunism and selective predation depending on the abundance of insect groups.",

A review of bat/plant dispersal interactions revealed that 15 species of\n              Cecropia\n              are consumed by 32 species of bats. In French Guiana, bats were captured in primary and secondary forests, yielding 936 fecal samples with diaspores, among which 162 contained fruits of\n              C. obtusa\n              ,\n              C. palmata\n              , and\n              C. sciadophylla\n              . A comparative morphological and anatomical study of fruits and seeds taken directly from herbarium specimens, bat feces, and an experimental soil seed bank was made. Contrary to previous reports, the dispersal unit of\n              Cecropia\n              is the fruit not the seed. Bats consume the infructescence, digest pulp derived from the enlarged, fleshy perianth, and defecate the fruits. The mucilaginous pericarp of\n              Cecropia\n              is described. The external mucilage production of\n              Cecropia\n              may facilitate endozoochory. The exocarp and part of the mesocarp may be lost after passage through the digestive tract of bats, but fruits buried for a year in the soil seed bank remain structurally unchanged. Fruit characters were found to be useful for identifying species of bat‐dispersed\n              Cecropia\n              . Bat dispersal is not necessary for seed germination but it increases seed survival and subsequent germination. Fruit structure plays a significant role in seed longevity.",

            "abstractNote": "Little is known about the ecological relationships of bats of Southcentral Alaska. We used AnaBat II bat detectors, mist-netting, and radio-telemetry to collect preliminary data on the distribution and status of bats on the Chugach National Forest (CNF), their activity patterns, and their roosting and foraging habitats. Myotis spp. were detected at 20 of 25 acoustic sampling sites. Bat activity tended to be higher at water sites than at road or trail sites, and higher in hardwood stands than in conifer stands, although these differences were not statistically significant. Based on data recorded at a maternity roost, the total activity period for bats during July was approximately 5 h per night; no bat activity was observed prior to sunset or after sunrise at any of the sites. Hourly activity was not related to temperature, but activity ended earlier on cooler nights. An adult male Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus) was tracked to a day-roost in a large Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis) snag with sloughing bark. Most female Little Brown Myotis captured at a maternity roost were either lactating or post-lactating. These preliminary findings suggest that bats are common on the CNF, but more research is needed to determine their habitat associations and their responses to disturbances including forest management practices, fire, insect outbreaks, climate change, and disease.",

We tested the response of Rafinesque’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) to social calls as a possible method to increase capture success and to understand the function of social calls. We also tested if calls of bats within the range of the previously designated subspecies differed, if the responses of Rafinesque’s big-eared bats varied with geographic origin of the calls, and if other species responded to the calls of C. rafinesquii. We recorded calls of Rafinesque’s big-eared bats at two colony roost sites in South Carolina, USA. Calls were recorded while bats were in the roosts and as they exited. Playback sequences for each site were created by copying typical pulses into the playback file. Two mist nets were placed approximately 50–500 m from known roost sites; the net with the playback equipment served as the Experimental net and the one without the equipment served as the Control net. Call structures differed significantly between the Mountain and Coastal Plains populations with calls from the Mountains being of higher frequency and longer duration. Ten of 11 Rafinesque’s big-eared bats were caught in the Control nets and, 13 of 19 bats of other species were captured at Experimental nets even though overall bat activity did not differ significantly between Control and Experimental nets. Our results suggest that Rafinesque’s big-eared bats are not attracted to conspecifics’ calls and that these calls may act as an intraspecific spacing mechanism during foraging.",

            "abstractNote": "One of the most significant changes to Earth's climate in recent decades has been an increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves. During heatwaves, animal's thermal window can be exceeded, and in extreme cases, mass mortality events have been observed. In 2018, a heatwave in north-­eastern Australia resulted in the death of approximately one-­third of the spectacled flying-­ fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) population at urban roosts in Cairns. The species has now been listed as endangered with future heatwaves considered the greatest threat to its survival. In this study, we investigated long-­term climatic trends for Cairns, paying particular attention to the frequency of extreme heat events from 1943 to 2022. We then characterized the microclimate of urban flying-­fox roosts during the Austral summers of 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 across Cairns to assess the long-­term feasibility of urban spectacled flying-­fox roosts. From the long-­term climate records, we observed an overall increase in Cairns' average annual temperature of 1.3°C from 1943 to 2022 and an increase in the number of excessively hot days per decade, from 16 in the first decade (1943–1952) to 67 in the last (2013–2022). We regularly detected maximum roost temperatures of 30–35°C during our study, with excessively hot days (>35°C) recorded more frequently than expected compared to Cairns's maximum temperatures from the last decade (2013–2023). We detected only 1 day where roost temperatures exceeded 40°C and no period that replicated the 2018 heatwave conditions. Furthermore, we found a significant negative relationship between roost ambient temperature and humidity, where the hottest days also coincided with those with the lowest humidity. Importantly, we found no difference in microclimate between roosts that were occupied and unoccupied by flying-­foxes during our study, suggesting that other environmental or behavioural factors are more influential for roost selection than the roosting microclimate. Ensuring the long-­term conservation of spectacled flying-­foxes under a changing climate will require the management of urban roosts to increase their thermal resistance to heatwaves, and more research is needed to identify the variables modulating this aspect.",

            "abstractNote": "Malassezia is a genus of medically-important, lipid-dependent yeasts that live on the skin of warmblooded animals. The 17 described species have been documented primarily on humans and domestic animals, but few studies have examined Malassezia species associated with more diverse host groups such as wildlife. While investigating the skin mycobiota of healthy bats, we isolated a Malassezia sp. that exhibited only up to 92 % identity with other known species in the genus for the portion of the DNA sequence of the internal transcribed spacer region that could be conﬁdently aligned. The Malassezia sp. was cultured from the skin of nine species of bats in the subfamily Myotinae; isolates originated from bats sampled in both the eastern and western United States. Physiological features and molecular characterisation at seven additional loci (D1/D2 region of 26S rDNA, 18S rDNA, chitin synthase, second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, β-tubulin, translation elongation factor EF-1α, and minichromosome maintenance complex component 7) indicated that all of the bat Malassezia isolates likely represented a single species distinct from other named taxa. Of particular note was the ability of the Malassezia sp. to grow over a broad range of temperatures (7– 40 °C), with optimal growth occurring at 24 °C. These thermal growth ranges, unique among the described Malassezia, may be an adaptation by the fungus to survive on bats during both the host’s hibernation and active seasons. The combination of genetic and physiological differences provided compelling evidence that this lipid-dependent yeast represents a novel species described herein as Malassezia vespertilionis sp. nov. Whole genome sequencing placed the new species as a basal member of the clade containing the species M. furfur, M. japonica, M. obtusa, and M. yamatoensis. The genetic and physiological uniqueness of Malassezia vespertilionis among its closest relatives may make it important in future research to better understand the evolution, life history, and pathogenicity of the Malassezia yeasts.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) has caused recent catastrophic declines among multiple species of bats in eastern North America. The disease's name derives from a visually apparent white growth of the newly discovered fungus Geomyces destructans on the skin (including the muzzle) of hibernating bats. Colonization of skin by this fungus is associated with characteristic cutaneous lesions that are the only consistent pathological finding related to WNS. However, the role of G. destructans in WNS remains controversial because evidence to implicate the fungus as the primary cause of this disease is lacking. The debate is fuelled, in part, by the assumption that fungal infections in mammals are most commonly associated with immune system dysfunction. Additionally, the recent discovery that G. destructans commonly colonizes the skin of bats of Europe, where no unusual bat mortality events have been reported, has generated further speculation that the fungus is an opportunistic pathogen and that other unidentified factors are the primary cause of WNS. Here we demonstrate that exposure of healthy little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) to pure cultures of G. destructans causes WNS. Live G. destructans was subsequently cultured from diseased bats, successfully fulfilling established criteria for the determination of G. destructans as a primary pathogen. We also confirmed that WNS can be transmitted from infected bats to healthy bats through direct contact. Our results provide the first direct evidence that G. destructans is the causal agent of WNS and that the recent emergence of WNS in North America may represent translocation of the fungus to a region with a naive population of animals.

Of the two species ofbats in New Zealand that are thought to eat fruit and pollen, one, Mystacina robusta is believed to be extinct and the other, M. tuberculata, is rare. A preliminary study in an area where F. baueriana is abundantbulM.tuberculata is locally extinct, found that limited cross-pollination and seed dispersal was still occurring. This would indicate thatF. baueriana is not dependent on the presence of bats to perform these functions. Results also indicate that the introduced possum, Trichosurus vulpecula,h acting as a pollinator and disperser of F. baueriana.",

To further knowledge of bat parasitology, pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus) were acquired from across the Greater Manchester and Lancashire region of England and examined for gastrointestinal helminths using morphological and molecular analyses†. Sixty-eight of 90 adult/juvenile bats (76% prevalence) were infected with at least 1 species of helminth and mean helminth abundance was 48·2 (+ / − 7·0). All helminths were digenean trematodes and the following species were identiﬁed in 51 P. pipistrellus specimens (prevalence in parentheses): Lecithodendrium linstowi (80·4%), L. spathulatum (19·6%), Prosthodendrium sp. (35·3%), Plagiorchis koreanus (29·4%) and Pycnoporus heteroporus (9·8%). Statistical analyses, incorporating multifactorial models, showed that male bats exhibited a signiﬁcantly more aggregated helminth distribution and lower abundance than females. Positive associations were observed between L. linstowi and L. spathulatum, Prosthodendrium sp. and P. heteroporus and between L. spathulatum and P. koreanus. A revised phylogeny of bat-associated Lecithodendriidae, incorporating novel L. spathulatum and Prosthodendrium sp. 28S rRNA sequences, separated the controversial clade formed by L. linstowi and P. hurkovaae. Further studies are likely to assist the understanding of bat-parasite/pathogen relationships, helminth infracommunity structures and phylogenetics.",

The carcasses of larger mammals were heavily ravaged by carnivores. Nearly 10,000 small-mammal remains appear to be derived primarily from decomposed owl pellets. The rich avifauna includes at least 29 species, mostly nonaquatic forms. Modern analogs of the most abundant birds and of a variety of rodents are associated with mesic woodland environments distant from large water bodies. These findings support inferences from associated geological, isotopic, invertebrate, and large-vertebrate assemblages. The combined results suggest that\n              Ar. ramidus\n              occupied a wooded Pliocene habitat.",

Comparison between these two biogeographic systems provides an opportunity to investigate the relative role of isolation in phylogeographic patterns and to elucidate the importance of evolution and demographic history in population structure. Herein, we use a genotypeby-sequencing approach (GBS) to explore population structure within three species of mastiff bats (Molossus molossus, M. coibensis, and M. milleri), which represent different ecological histories and geographical distributions in the genus. We tested the hypotheses that oceanic straits serve as barriers to dispersal in Caribbean bats and that isolated island populations are more likely to experience genetic drift and bottlenecks in comparison with highly connected ones, thus leading to different phylogeographic patterns. We show that population structures vary according to general habitat preferences, levels of population isolation, and historical fluctuations in climate. In our dataset, mainland geographic barriers played only a small role in isolation of lineages. However, oceanic straits posed a partial barrier to the dispersal for some populations within some species (M. milleri), but do not seem to disrupt gene flow in others (M. molossus). Lineages on distant islands undergo genetic bottlenecks more frequently than island lineages closer to the mainland, which have a greater exchange of haplotypes.",

Here, we reported the complete mitogenome sequence of P. vampyrus, which was 16,554 bp and composed of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, and one control region, with a base composition of lower G+C content (41.5%). Like other bats, all genes were located on H-strand except for eight tRNA and ND6 genes. Most protein-coding genes started with an ATG codon except for ND2, ND3, and ND5, which initiated with ATA or ATT instead, and terminated with the typical stop codon (TAA/TAG) or a single T or an unexpected codon of AGG. Within the control region, 6 bp repeat (TACGCA) was appeared only nine times, much lower than other published Pteropus species. These results provided basic information for researching Pteropus vampyrus on genetics, phylogeny, and adaptive evolution.",

            "abstractNote": "Between 2001 and 2008, we recorded Myotis alcathoe at nine sites within three distant areas in the Czech Republic. The species identification was confirmed with cyt b sequences and four distinct haplotypes were identified. All the localities exhibit surprisingly uniform habitat characteristics: (1) old full-grown oak-hornbeam forests, with (2) numerous large trees in advanced stages of decay are present, and (3) a very small to large water bodies and/or patches of riparian vegetation surrounded by the forest. Using radiotracking techniques, we discovered 27 day roosts of M. alcathoe, located mostly in big oak, birch and lime trees inside extensive forest stands. All roosts were fissures or small cavities in a tree trunk and in branches in the canopies, some 16 m above the ground. Bats preferred trees that were higher, had higher canopy and canopy basement and had larger diameter at breast height than other available trees. Roost trees were surrounded by lower trees with lower canopy basements than available trees. Roost trees were in a poorer condition than other available trees. Roosts were occupied by up to 83 individuals in July but usually single individuals were found in the roosts in September. In contrast to syntopic M. mystacinus and M. brandtii, M. alcathoe has never been found in an anthropogenic roost (except for a fissure in concrete electricity pole). Preliminary analysis of the diet showed that nematoceran flies were the most important prey item along with spiders, caddis flies, small moths and neuropterans. In the observed ecological characteristics, M. alcathoe markedly differs from other European species of the genus Myotis. Its restricted habitat requirements are perhaps responsible for an islet-like pattern of its distribution and suggest an essential conservation value of the habitats of its occurrence.",

This migrating species is monoestrous with copulation occurring around April in South African populations. Embryonic development is stalled during hibernation by delayed implantation of the blastocyst. As a result, limb bud stage embryos (CS13) are first noted in other South African populations in mid-September. The timing of these reproductive events for the De Hoop population is similar with bats arriving at the maternity roosts in September and embryos at the limb bud stage (CS13) being noted in this month. Pregnancy was not synchronous in the population with bats dissected on the same day exhibiting differences in the stage of development of their young (CS11 to CS21 being the largest range). Maternal features (progesterone concentration, body mass and abdominal distension) were analysed to determine if they provided a reliable estimate of embryonic stage. The progesterone concentrations of pregnant bats showed a similar profile to the Kwa-Zulu Natal and the Eastern Cape populations. Though progesterone concentration did increase as pregnancy progressed, it was not an accurate predictor of embryonic stage. Maternal body mass did not correlate with the stage of embryonic development. However, abdominal distension determined by palpation is an accurate field based predictor of the stages of pregnancy: no abdominal distension, small to medium abdominal distension and large abdominal distension distinguished between non-pregnant bats and those carrying either early (CS11–CS15) or mid-developmental stages (CS16–CS21), respectively.",

We examined roost use and selection by Rafinesque’s big-eared bat at the tree, stand, and landscape scales during the maternity season in pristine old-growth habitat in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina. We located 43 roosts (14 maternity, 29 solitary) through cavity searches and radio-telemetry. Maternity colonies and solitary individuals selected roosts based on similar characteristics. The best model explaining roost selection by all bats included tree and stand characteristics; landscape factors had little influence on roost use. Bats selected large diameter trees in areas with a high density of trees with cavities in the surrounding area. Most roosts (67.4%) were in water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) in semi-permanently flooded and saturated areas. Half of maternity roost cavities had upper bole openings whereas only 25.8% of solitary roosts had upper bole openings. Bats that roosted with maternity groups stayed in roosts for significantly shorter periods of time (1.3 ± 0.1 days) and used significantly more roost trees (5.0 ± 0.6 roosts) than adult males (3.8 ± 1.10 days, 2.3 ± 0.4 roosts, respectively). Maternity colony use of cavities with upper bole openings and shorter residency times suggest that predator avoidance may have been an important factor governing roosting behavior of maternity colonies in this area. Our results suggest that retention of large diameter, hollow trees in wetland areas will benefit Rafinesque’s big-eared bat individuals and maternity colonies in this area.",

Measurements were analysed by Chi-square, ANOVA, t-tests and regression to identify any relationship between the body mass index and the condition of canine and molar teeth, as well as in relation to sex and season.\nResults There was no statistically signiﬁcant relationship between a bat’s dentition state and the body mass index being used.\nConclusions In Townsville, the black ﬂying-fox appears to experience a rapid decline in dental condition over time. Despite this, there is little indication that loss of teeth results in a decline in body condition. We attribute this to the dominance of ﬂoral foods in the bats’ diet in Townsville and a lesser importance of hard fruit that requires intact dentition for consumption. Edentulousness on its own is not suﬃcient reason to euthanase black ﬂying-foxes in either Townsville or similar relatively dry localities where blossom dominates the ﬂying-fox diet.",

A total of 45 individuals of N. geoffroyi and 27 C. gouldii were ®tted with radio-transmitters, resulting in the location of 139 and 89 roosts, respectively. Male N. geoffroyi roosted in trees, fallen and decayed timber and arti®cial structures. These roosts were low to the ground, mainly under bark and in cracks in timber. Roosts of female N. geoffroyi were located higher above ground, and all within trees. Maternity roosts were predominantly located in large dead trees, approximately twice the diameter of roost trees used by females outside the breeding season. No maternity roosts were found under bark, despite half the roosts used by non-breeding females being located in these situations. Both sexes roosted primarily in dead timber and used cavities where the narrowest dimension of the entrance was 2.5 cm. Most roosts of C. gouldii were in dead spouts on large, live river red gum Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees. Intraspeci®c differences in roost characteristics were less pronounced for this species. Despite access to the same roosting opportunities, there were marked differences in roost selection between N. geoffroyi and C. gouldii. Both species favoured large diameter trees, but differed signi®cantly for all other measured variables: type of roost structure, condition of roost tree (live or dead), height of roost tree, height of roost, and entrance dimensions. Although these species are among the most widespread bats in Australia and are often considered to be habitat `generalists', both displayed a high level of discrimination in the roosts used. Clearly, roosting requirements are a complex and important issue in the conservation of even the most common species of bats.",

They have been used to investigate the physiological state and the adaptation of individuals to their habitat, changes in nutritional state of birds, body condition, the level of parasite infestation, male quality, the physical condition of nestlings, etc. In the present study we tested the role of haematological and plasma biochemistry values in burrowing parrots\n              Cyanoliseus patagonus\n              (Aves, Psittaciformes) for determining individual quality and condition. We measured triglyceride levels, plasma protein levels, plasma hue and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of nestlings and breeding adults in a colony in the north of Patagonia, Argentina. We found that plasma triglyceride levels strongly relate to changes in individual condition. Plasma levels of triglycerides were found to be strongly related to mass change, hatching order and brood size in nestlings. Levels of triglycerides were found to reflect reproductive effort in adults: males fledging larger broods had decreased levels of triglycerides. Adults with lower body condition had increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Plasma hue showed a strong relationship with an ornamental trait, the red abdominal patch of male adults, and with parameters of structural body size. Thus, we have shown that haematological and plasma biochemistry values, especially plasma levels of triglycerides, are good indicators of individual quality and condition in nestlings and breeding birds.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats of the genus Myotis cannot be identified reliably using conventional acoustic analyses. Here we use morphology of echolocation calls to discriminate between Myotis spp. This method may be used to identify unknown roosts to species level. Echolocation calls of M. daubentonii, M. mystacinus and M. nattereri, were recorded in emergence flights from roosts. Images of echolocation calls were extracted for morphological analysis performed in SHAPE, a program that transforms two-dimensional outline data into Elliptic Fourier Descriptors. Species typical call shapes were described with Mahalanobis models. Discriminant Function Analyses (DFA) were applied with Mahalanobis scores of typical shape alone and with a spectral call parameter, maximum frequency. DFA achieved an overall correct classification rate of 88.9% using typical outline shapes alone. Correct classification of 100% of both M. daubentonii and M. mystacinus was achieved by both typical call outlines. For M. nattereri, 79.6% of calls were correctly classified by call morphology, but the addition of maximum frequency improved this to 96.3%. Shape analyses provide a quick and easy method of distinguishing Myotis species under field conditions and could be extended to include other species of bats that share conventional acoustic parameters.",

Radio-telemetry was used to track 17 bats in November 1988 (lactation season) and 11 in May 1989 (mating season) to 87 roosts in 49 trees within the littoral rainforest. The bats frequently changed roosts, which were clustered within a small area. During November, lactating females moved twins between diurnal roosts and some carried twins while foraging. Twins represented a load of up to 95% of their mother's bodyweight. Bats roosted communally in foliage and tree hollows, beneath peeling bark, among epiphytes, and between strangler figs and host trees. Hollows were used more frequently when bats were lactating, while the use of foliage roosts was greater during the mating season. Roosts were concentrated in four tree species, although a wide range of other tree species was used. Roost trees used in November were taller (17 m) than those used in May (8.2 m), and refiect selection oi Syzygium leuhmannii and Acmena hemilampra, both trees of the forest interior. The converse applied for selection of Cupaniopsis anacardioides, a small tree of the littoral zone, in May. These results identify the need for conserving a diversity of roosts for this species of bat.",

In this paper, the evaluation of habitat suitability of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) in the Wuling Mountains was studied. The global positioning system (GPS), remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) were used to obtain ground survey data and analyse the habitat factors driving the distribution of R. sinicus. The binary logistic regression model and the Maximum Entropy Model (MAXENT model) were used to analyse the habitat suitability of R. sinicus, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the models. The results showed that both models had high prediction accuracy, but the results of the MAXENT model were more stable than those of the binary logistic regression model when the sample size changed, indicating that the MAXENT model was the optimal method. Thena jack-knife test was used to determine the importance of the influencing factors. The results showed that the main factors influencing habitat selection were annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, the nearest distance from a settlement and vegetation fractional coverage (VFC). The suitable habitat was mainly distributed in the middle region of the study area. Marginally suitable habitat was located on the edge of suitable habitat, and unsuitable habitats were mainly distributed in the southern and northwestern regions.",

The Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus) and Yuma Myotis (Myotis yumanensis) are sympatric in parts of their range in western North America, and they overlap in morphology, making them difficult to tell apart in the hand in some areas, such as the Pacific Northwest. We compared various methods of distinguishing between M. lucifugus and M. yumanensis to genetic results, using a blind test approach to remove observer bias. Using multiple independent observers, we used external morphology and echolocation-call structure to classify bats from a maternity colony consisting of both species. Genetic analysis confirmed 13 M. lucifugus and 40 M. yumanensis. Minimum echolocation-call frequency separated 100% of M. lucifugus from M. yumanensis using a cut-off of 43 kHz. All M. lucifugus had a minimum echolocation-call frequency #42.8 kHz, whereas M. yumanensis had a minimum frequency $44.55 kHz. There was some overlap in forearm length; a cut-off of 36 mm would have correctly identified 77% of M. lucifugus and 100% of M. yumanensis to species. Criteria based on subjective assessment of fur sheen and length as well as ear color were moderately successful (90.5 and 77% success by 2 separate observers) in distinguishing between the 2 species. The use of Munsell soil color charts and multivariate statistics to classify fur and membrane color and confirm species identification was not successful. Our results suggest that mean minimum call frequency alone is sufficient for distinguishing between M. lucifugus and M. yumanensis. Use of quantitative rather than qualitative criteria eliminates observer bias and appears to be better for identifying these 2 species.",

Whilst low severity fire has positive benefits for increased insectivorous bat activity and diversity, little information is available on the impact on rainforest specialised clutter dependant species such as the Golden-tipped Bat Phoniscus papuensis. Our aims were to assess the effects of fire on occupancy of habitat across the geographic range of P. papuensis in NSW, to determine the smaller scale effects of fire on use of diurnal roosts in rainforest through radio tracking and to trial the use of artificial structures to temporarily increase roost availability in burnt habitat. We observed that widespread fire encroaching on rainforest has a negative association with occupancy by P. papuensis, with this metric ~78% lower than in unburnt forest. In burnt areas, P. papuensis preferentially used unburnt refugia for their roosting sites in suspended bird nests and the loss of these habitat structures likely contributes to the disappearance of P. papuensis from the landscape. Artificial roosts were not used in the short-term (&lt; 2 years post fire) and do not appear to be a feasible management tool. With the increasing frequency and extent of wildfires the most important factor for P. papuensis to persist in the landscape into the future is the protection of its habitat through ensuring sensitive management of large tracts of connected rainforest to help buffer against the encroachment of future mega-fires.",

In certain areas of its distribution, it is likely the only bat pollinator and seed disperser of plants, and it is currently highly endangered. However, some aspects of its ecology, diet, and pollinator role remain unknown, especially in the unique and endangered lomas ecosystem. We conducted monthly evaluations of bats and plants over 15 months in the lomas of the National Reserve of Lachay (Peru) by sampling in three different plant communities along the Guayabito gorge. We collected fecal and pollen fur samples from 16 individuals of P. genovensium and recorded the phenology of its potential plant food resources. We differentiated fecal sample components and then identified and counted all pollen morphotypes in order to estimate their frequency and abundance in the samples. We also analyzed the niche breadth. Our results showed that the dietary components of P. genovensium included nectar, pollen, fruits, and insects, and that it utilized the cacti community for feeding. Pollen of the genus Haageocereus (Cactaceae) was the most frequent and abundant resource recorded, which was available all year long; moreover, the niche breadth analysis revealed that P. genovensium has a specialized diet on the Haageocereus cactus in Lachay. Finally, we suggest that P. genovensium could serve as a pollinator for Haageocereus acranthus, Haageocereus pseudomelanostele, and Puya ferruginea (Bromeliaceae) due to the large pollen loads it carries and the specific placement of pollen on different body zones.",

Allozyme variation revealed mean heterozygosity levels within islands of 0.047, which is near the mammalian average. However, heterozygosity tended to decline from west to east as populations approached the periphery of the species’ distribution, and was lowest in those islands that were separated by the greatest sea-crossing from source populations. There is extensive between-island genetic differentiation (mean FST = 0.40) and relationships between islands are associated with their arrangement in geographical space; genetic distance is correlated with geographical distance and the genetic arrangement of islands is associated with longitude. The arrangement of islands as indicated by variation in body and skull metrics is also associated with their geographical positions, and the metric and genetic measures are themselves associated. While other taxa in the region have shown genetic-geographical concordances, R. afﬁnis is the only one that displays concordant patterns in metrical features. These patterns in biological diversity are interpreted as arising from the sequential island population structure and clines in key biogeographic gradients.",

Of these, four families (Anacardiaceae, Bignonaceae, Malvaceae, and Sapotaceae) were identified from remnants of flower petals in food boluses while the remaining families (Annonaceae, Arecaceae, Ebenaceae, Meliaceae, Moraceae, Myrtaceae, and Sapindaceae) were identified from the seeds in the boluses and from guano samples. Plants in the family Moraceae (50.7%) comprised most of the bat’s diet. Fruit of Ficus retusa (27.5%) and F. carica (23.0%) during winter, F. glomerata (30.9%) and F. religiosa (28.1%) during spring, Psidium guajava (19.6%), F. bengalensis (18.7%) and Diospyros peregrina (17.8%) during summer, and D. peregrina (71.9%) during autumn, were the most frequently identified items. The four seasonal diets varied significantly (χ2 = 435, d.f. = 18, P < 0.01). Results confirm that the ecological services rendered by P. giganteus, such as pollination and seed dispersal, outweigh its losses, such as damage to the ripe fruit. Hence, the species should not be regarded as a pest; rather efforts should be made to ensure its conservation.",

We identified various roosts used by R. ferrumequinum within the park and investigated their microclimatic parameters (temperature, relative humidity and daily temperature excursion). We monitored roost use for one year and found it not only to be influenced by season and the microclimatic conditions of different roosts, but also by occasional stress conditions such as disturbance by predators. We also studied nightly emergence behavior, specifically we considered how this is influenced by climatic (temperature, relative humidity and evening light intensity) and demographic (presence of pups, subadults and colony size) parameters. The colony always performed a pre-emergence behavior and we found that its onset occurred earlier at higher temperatures, lower evening light intensity, in larger colonies and in the presence of pups. High temperature and low evening light intensity also resulted in a longer nightly emergence, which was also identified in larger colonies and when subadults were present. This study highlights the importance of the conservation of multiple roosts within the distribution range of R. ferrumequinum nurseries. Additionally, we demonstrated how certain climatic and demographic factors influence both pre-emergence and emergence behavior.",

The mitochondrial genome is composed 22 tRNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, and two rRNA genes. Molecular phylogeny of the order Chiroptera based on the maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference trees supports the classification of R. amplexicaudatus to genus Rousettus and family Pteropodidae. Furthermore, both trees support the modern division of order Chiroptera into the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera clades.",

Radio telemetry was used to ﬁnd roosts in summer during late pregnancy and through the lactation period by tagging two common species; Daubenton’s bats Myotis daubentonii (Kuhl 1817) and soprano pipistrelles Pipistrellus pygmaeus (Leach 1825). In addition, tree roosts were searched using ultrasound detectors at three sites. A total of 35 roosts in natural crevices were found using radio telemetry and through searches with ultrasound detectors and 31 of these roosts were in hollow trees, the majority in aspens Populus tremula L. (n = 30). Some tree roosts were even used by the northern bat Eptesicus nilssonii (Keyserling & Blasius 1839) which is considered a house-dwelling species in Norway. Aspens have some qualities preferred by bats and were both warmer and safer than other hollow tree species in this study area. Bat boxes are used as maternity roosts mainly by soprano pipistrelles at these latitudes, thus at present, there is no suitable alternative to hollow trees that would satisfy all tree-dwelling bat species.",

The majority of a hibernator’s energy reserves are used to fuel brief, but costly, arousals from torpor. Although arousals likely serve multiple functions, an important one is to restore water stores depleted during torpor. Many hibernating bat species require high humidity, presumably to reduce torpid water loss, but big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) appear tolerant of a wide humidity range. We tested the hypothesis that hibernating female E. fuscus use behavioural flexibility during torpor and arousals to maintain water balance and reduce energy expenditure. We predicted: (1) E. fuscus hibernating in dry conditions would exhibit more compact huddles during torpor and drink more frequently than bats in high humidity conditions; and (2) the frequency and duration of torpor bouts and arousals, and thus total loss of body mass would not differ between bats in the two environments. We housed hibernating E. fuscus in temperature- and humidity-controlled incubators at 50% or 98% relative humidity (8°C, 110 days). Bats in the dry environment maintained a more compact huddle during torpor and drank more frequently during arousals. Bats in the two environments had a similar number of arousals, but arousal duration was shorter in the dry environment. However, total loss of body mass over hibernation did not differ between treatments, indicating that the two groups used similar amounts of energy. Our results suggest that behavioural flexibility allows hibernating E. fuscus to maintain water balance and reduce energy costs across a wide range of hibernation humidities.",

Echolocation calls were recorded using a Pettersson D980 bat detector, the high frequency output fed into a personal computer via an F2000 Control Filter and an Ines High speed card. Recorded as .wav files, recordings were analyzed with BatSoundPro. We measured call duration (DUR in ms), frequency with maximum energy (FMAX in kHz), highest frequency (HF in kHz), lowest frequency (LF in kHz), and inter-pulse interval (IPI in ms). Multivariate Analyses of Variance (MANOVA) indicated significant differences in call features between species, between settings, between species in each setting, and finally between settings for each individual. Discriminant Function Analyses (DFA) revealed that inside DUR was the most important parameter distinguishing M. lucifugus from M. leibii, with 66.3% correct classification, while outside, the two species were distinguished 78.8% of the time by LF. The data demonstrate that the same individuals flying in confined spaces change the details of their echolocation calls compared to when flying in the open. Calls produced inside are shorter in DUR and are produced at shorter IPIs than calls produced outside. FMAX differed most between the calls of M. lucifugus and M. leibii whether flying inside or outside. Differences between echolocation calls were more pronounced between setting (inside versus outside) than between species.",

Bats of the genus Myotis include insectivorous, facultatively piscivorous, and piscivorous species. We tested the hypothesis that facultatively piscivorous (five Myotis species) and piscivorous species (M. vivesi) present cranial morphological and functional changes with respect to insectivorous taxa (16 Myotis species). Cranial shapes in skull and mandible modules were described with four geometric landmark configurations in these dietary groups. Gape capacity was measured with the stretch factors for temporal and masseter muscles. Geometric configurations from two skull and two mandible shapes were analyzed to detect differences in cranial morphology in relation to diet. Differences in cranial morphology were found between piscivorous and insectivorous species involving the mandibular process where masticatory muscles are attached. Linear regression analysis of Procrustes distances and gape capacity showed that the shape of the mandibular process region was highly correlated with the stretch factor of the masseter muscle in piscivorous and facultatively piscivorous species. These results suggest differences in cranial morphology and performance among diets but the hypothesis of gradual changes in cranial shape among diets was only accepted for the mandible and not for the skull. Myotis vivesi appears to improve mechanical advantage of masticatory muscles at lower gapes, presumably allowing more efficient chewing of slippery prey.",

            "abstractNote": "Torpor is an adaptation for energy conservation employed by many species of small-bodied endotherms. However, surprisingly little is known regarding proximate factors influencing day-to-day variation in torpor expression in the wild. We used open-flow respirometry to quantify torpor expression in nine little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus, LeConte 1831) at two ambient temperatures (7 degrees C and 17 degrees C) following either sham feeding or consumption of a high-protein meal (50% or 100% of the mass required to reach satiation for each individual). Food consumption significantly increased the time spent normothermic before torpor entry but did not affect either the rate of body cooling or torpid metabolic rate. Bats did not fully exploit potential energy savings by maximising their use of torpor. Instead they varied torpor expression such that total energy expenditure over the course of each 22-h trial was balanced against gross energy intake immediately before the trial, independent of ambient temperature. This was accomplished by adjusting the timing of entry into torpor (thus altering the time spent torpid), rather than by modulating torpid metabolic rate. However, pre-trial body mass was also a significant predictor of torpor expression, which suggests that energy reserves combine with recent foraging success to influence individuals' decisions about depth and duration of their torpor bouts. We also present evidence that little brown bats use the heat generated through digestion (i.e. the heat increment of feeding) to substitute for active thermogenesis at sub-thermoneutral temperatures, thereby reducing the energetic costs of thermoregulation prior to torpor entry.",

            "abstractNote": "Introduction: Bats are a diverse group of mammals that have unique features allowing them to act as reservoir hosts for several zoonotic pathogens such as Leptospira. Leptospires have been classified into pathogenic, intermediate, and saprophytic groups and more recently into clades P1, P2, S1, and S2, being all the most important pathogenic species related to leptospirosis included within the P1/pathogenic clade. Leptospira has been detected from bats in several regions worldwide; however, the diversity of leptospires harboured by bats is still unknown. Aim: The aim of the present study was to determine the genetic diversity of Leptospira spp. harboured by bats worldwide.\nMethods: A systematic review was conducted on four databases to retrieve studies in which Leptospira was detected from bats. All studies were screened to retrieve all available Leptospira spp. 16S rRNA sequences from the GenBank database and data regarding their origin. Sequences obtained were compared with each other and reference sequences of Leptospira species and analysed through phylogenetic analysis.\nResults: A total of 418 Leptospira spp. 16S rRNA sequences isolated from 55 bat species from 14 countries were retrieved from 15 selected manuscripts. From these, 417 sequences clustered within the P1/pathogenic group, and only one sequence clustered within the P2/intermediate group. Six major clades of P1/pathogenic Leptospira spp. were identified, three of them composed exclusively of sequences obtained from bats.\nConclusion: We identified that bats harbour a great genetic diversity of Leptospira spp. that form part of the P1/pathogenic clade, some of which are closely related to leptospirosis-­associated species. This finding contributes to the knowledge of the diversity of leptospires hosted by bats worldwide and reinforces the role of bats as reservoirs of P1/pathogenic Leptospira spp.",

Using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), we provide molecular evidence for Pd on four big brown bats overwintering in heated buildings in New Brunswick, Canada. Two of the affected individuals also had very mild, focal, pustular, fungal dermatitis identified microscopically. A third bat, which was qPCR Pd-negative, had similar fungal lesions. Despite determining that these fungal lesions were caused by a suspected ascomycete, the intralesional fungi were not confirmed to be Pd. These findings demonstrate that bats overwintering in heated buildings and other above-ground sites may have subclinical or preclinical WNS, or be contaminated with Pd, and could play a role in local dispersal of Pd. Our inability to determine if the ascomycetes causing pustular lesions were Pd highlights the need for ancillary diagnostic tests, such as in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry, so that Pd can be detected directly within a lesion. As the host–pathogen relationship for Pd evolves, and where bat species are exposed to the fungus under varying temperature regimes, lesions may become less stereotypic and such tests could help define these changes.",

            "abstractNote": "The Gomantong cave system, Kinabatangan, Sabah (Malaysia) hosts one of the largest bat colonies known from north Borneo. The nightly exodus of Chaerophon plicatus from this site is an economically valuable tourist attraction, and must impose significant controls on the regional ecology. Monitoring ecosystem health requires monitoring bat population size, but no quantitative assessments for the Gomantong colony are available in the literature. Traditional censusing techniques (based on packing density and roost area or on roost exodus counts) yield notoriously unreliable results. Here we have applied innovative image analysis and counting techniques to videographic, photographic and terrestrial laser scanning data obtained in July 2012. The colony exits in a consistent stream along a narrow exit trajectory. The laser scanning of the large cave entrance allowed precise measurement of bat position. Video data provided 0.02-second time resolution. Average flight speed was calculated (10.38 ± 0.85 m/sec), bat exit rate was estimated at three minute intervals (peaking at 14,000 bats/minute) and then summed over the 40 minutes of bat flight. The resultant colony size estimate of 275,625–276,939 (95% confidence interval) individuals of C. plicatus in Gomantong Caves in 2012 demonstrates that the technique is viable, provides a realistic basis for ecosystem management, and can be repeated to monitor ecosystem change. The estimated insect consumption by the colony of this size is 927 ± 191 metric tons of insects per year over an estimated 270 km2 area, a very important component in maintaining ecosystem stability in the Gomantong Forest Reserve and the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, as well as pest control over the large agricultural tracts of the region.",

Populations at high latitudes face four challenges: a shorter active season and shorter nights during the active season (less time to accumulate fat), a longer hibernation period (larger fat store needed), and colder nights (reduced prey availability). Mating also occurs during the prehibernation period, placing time constraints for mating and fattening on northern populations. We tested the hypothesis that these factors constrain prehibernation foraging in northern populations of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte, 1831)). We measured plasma triglyceride concentration to study prehibernation fueling rates of a population near the northern range limit of the species and compared our results with previously published results from a more southern population. In contrast to bats at the lower latitude, we found consistently low concentrations of plasma triglycerides, indicating a low fuelling rate throughout the prehibernation p...",

The need for migratory stopover sites to rest and refuel, such as used by birds, has been repeatedly suggested, but not previously tested empirically in bats.\n            \n            \n              2.\n               We studied migrating silver‐haired bats (\n              Lasionycteris noctivagans\n              ) at Long Point, ON, Canada. We used digital radio‐transmitters to track 30 bats using an array of five towers that effectively covered the entire region (\n              c.\n              20 × 40 km). We measured stopover duration and departure direction, and documented movement patterns, foraging activity and roost sites. We measured body composition on arrival using quantitative magnetic resonance and simulated long‐distance migration using observed body composition to predict migration range and rate.\n            \n            \n              3.\n               Migration occurred in two waves (late August and mid‐September). Most bats stayed 1–2 days, although two remained >2 weeks. One third of the bats foraged while at the site, many foraging opportunistically on nights when rain precluded continued migration. Bats roosted in a variety of tree species and manmade structures in natural and developed areas. Half of the bats departed across Lake Erie (minimum crossing distance\n              c.\n              38 km) while half departed along the shoreline.\n            \n            \n              4.\n               Simulations predicted a migration rate of\n              c.\n              250–275 km per day and suggest that all but one of the bats in our study carried sufficient fuel stores to reach the putative wintering area (estimated distance 1500 km) without further refuelling.\n            \n            \n              5.\n               Our results suggest that migrating bats stopover for sanctuary or short‐term rest as opposed to extended rest and refuelling as in many songbirds. Daily torpor could reduce energy costs when not in flight, minimizing the need for extended stopovers and allowing bats to potentially complete their migration at a fraction of the time and energy cost of similar sized birds.",

We characterized levels of genetic diversity and population structure of the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte, 1831)) in eastern Canada to infer the extent to which oceanic straits may be barriers to movement. To quantify metrics of gene ﬂow and infer movement dynamics, we genotyped 679 M. lucifugus at nine nuclear microsatellites (nDNA) and sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We found high levels of genetic diversity and little population structure, with ≈13-fold higher differentiation of mtDNA than nDNA markers, suggesting that structuring patterns largely result from female philopatry. Discriminant analysis of principle components suggested that the subtle underlying structure was not concordant with sampling site. Regional differentiation (FST, Dest, Mantel test residuals) is mostly consistent with genetic isolation by distance. However, samples from Newfoundland showed genetic differentiation over and above the effects of distance, lower levels of genetic diversity, and less genetic connectivity with other sampled regions. Despite this, oceanic straits in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence do not appear to create an impenetrable barrier to movement, therefore it may be possible for white-nose syndrome to spread to Newfoundland.",

The total haplotype and nucleotide diversity are 0.63 ± 0.055 and 0.0021 ± 0.00017, respectively which suggest that R. ferrumequinum exhibits low genetic diversity. AMOVA analysis shows that more variation of genetic differentiation is present among populations of phylogenetic groupings than within populations. Our phylogenetic results support the monophyly of R. ferrumequinum and suggest this taxon comprises three allopatric/parapatric phylogroups that are distributed in Europe-western Turkey, eastern Turkeynorthern Iran, and southern Iran. The Europe-western Turkey lineage (clade 2) split from the eastern Turkey-Iran lineage (clade 1) during the middle Pleistocene (0.8534 (ca.I)À0.6454 (ca.II) Ma). The divergence time among subclades A and B occurred during the mid-Pleistocene (0.4849 (ca.I)À0.369 (ca.II) Ma). All phylogenetic analyses also indicate that the Iranian and eastern Turkey R. ferrumequinum diverged from Europe and western Turkey R. ferrumequinum, with the mean percentage sequence differences ranging from 0.92%À0.75% between them. We infer that long-term isolation of R. ferrumequinum in spatially distinct refugia in parts of southwestern and northeastern Iran has promoted distinct phylogeographic lineages during the Pleistocene.",

Population viability analysis may help guide population management and the identification of populations more prone to decline, allowing a preventive approach to avoid population declines and extinctions. The objective of the present study was to evaluate if differences in reproductive strategy translate into differential intrinsic vulnerability among different populations of Phyllostomus hastatus. We used the software VORTEX to model the dynamics and viability of P. hastatus populations under different reproductive scenarios. We modeled a total of 12 scenarios evaluating variations in reproductive characteristics of the species (monoestry vs polyestry, harem size, and infant mortality rate). Phyllostomus hastatus populations were viable under most scenarios, except with scenarios incorporating monoestry and high pup mortality. Our results demonstrate that both reproductive strategies (monoestry and polyestry) found in P. hastatus result in viable and stable populations under natural conditions. However, polyestrous populations have higher growth rates, making them more resilient to natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances. A significant portion of the more resilient populations in South America overlap the Amazon Forest, a continuous and preserved habitat under low human pressure, which bodes well for the long-term persistence of these populations. On the other hand, the populations of the species that evolved the monoestrous reproductive strategy are located in Mesoamerica, a Biodiversity Hotspot that is under severe human impacts, particularly from habitat loss. Conservation biologists and managers must take into account intra-specific demographic differences of species when planning for their long-term persistence.",

Therefore, the application of geometric morphometric (GM) techniques could yield more refined and robust analyses of inter- and intraspecific variations. In this study, we generated two datasets: one with molecular delimitation data based on the barcode region (COI) and the other with cranial size and shape data using GM methods. Our aims were to investigate variations between large and small species within the genus Artibeus, as well as to explore potential factors influencing such variations. The results from species delimitation revealed molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) supporting the morphological identification. Analyses using GM techniques demonstrated significant inter- and intraspecific variations in cranial size and shape among Artibeus species. The combined outcomes suggest the absence of a significant phylogenetic signal influencing skull variation. This scenario indicates that potential historical ecological factors may have directly influenced the cranial morphology of these species, acting as significant selection forces in geographical space and generating intraspecific variations in Artibeus planirostris.",

Based on this assumption, the present study aims to gain insights into the roosting and breeding behavior of the greater mouse-­eared bat (Myotis myotis) in relation to changes of the ambient temperature. For this purpose, we investigated the effect of ambient temperature on the phenology of the greater mouse-­eared bat by using activity data of the bats collected using light barriers at the maternity roosts. The light barrier used in this study is a system that detects the interruption of two light beams, for example, by a flying bat, and displays it as an electrical signal.",

            "abstractNote": "Microsatellites are often the marker of choice for population genetic studies at intermediate spatial and temporal scales. Developing large numbers of markers has traditionally been technically difﬁcult, and this has limited our ability to investigate evolutionary phenomena that emerge across short temporal scales. Moreover, few markers tend to successfully amplify across species boundaries. As rapid advancements in high-throughput sequencing make microsatellite development cost- and time-effective, new avenues for evolutionary, population genetic and chromosome linkage mapping research are emerging. We used a published PERL script and second-generation sequencing to rapidly and affordably develop microsatellite loci for a widespread phyllostomid bat, Artibeus lituratus, for which no markers were previously available. We used Roche FLX (Titanium) Genome Sequencing to randomly sequence  101 Mb (255 065 unique reads) of genomic DNA for A. lituratus, within which we discovered 30 100 microsatellite loci. We designed primers for 19 395 loci that contained suitable ﬂanking regions. We ordered primers for 96 loci, 90 of which produced a single PCR product in A. lituratus. We genotyped 52 loci, and 45 were polymorphic in A. lituratus. We tested cross-species ampliﬁcation for 96 loci in six additional phyllostomid species: A. planirostris, A. ﬁmbriatus, A. phaeotis, Enchisthenes hartii, Sturnira lilium, and Carollia perspicillata. Cross-species ampliﬁcation was successful for at least one species for 87 loci (A. ﬁmbriatus), and in all species, at least 66 loci were ampliﬁed. These markers will not only facilitate future work on these seven species, but also illustrate the utility of this high-throughput method for development of primers across many species simultaneously.",

            "abstractNote": "Factors affecting the foraging of mobile native fauna in highly fragmented urban landscapes have seldom been quantiﬁed at large spatial scales. We investigated factors affecting foraging by Grey-headed Flyingfoxes (Pteropus poliocephalus; ‘ﬂying-foxes’) in the greater Melbourne metropolitan area. Flying-foxes established a continuously occupied colony site in the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne in 1986, and the size of the colony has subsequently increased greatly. We used a stratiﬁed-random sampling design to examine the importance of six variables on the detection of foraging ﬂying-foxes: (i) distance from the colony site (0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 km); (ii) distance from the Yarra River (0–5 and 5–20 km); (iii) the relative tree density of the municipality; (iv) whether the site was a park or street; (v) whether there was a relatively high or low density of trees at the site; and (vi) whether food was or was not detected at the site. We surveyed 240 sites within a 30-km radius of the colony site for foraging ﬂying-foxes in both May and October 2002. The probability of detecting a foraging ﬂying-fox declined with increasing distance from the colony site, but increased with increasing tree cover, and was higher for parks compared with streets and when food was present. Flying-foxes were observed foraging in a number of plant genera that have no species that naturally occur in the Melbourne area. Flying-foxes in Melbourne thus forage on planted resources that are widely distributed within a fragmented landscape, and are an example of a positive response by a native species to the process of urbanization.",

Domestic animals are commonly implicated as reservoirs of\n              S. enterica\n              and\n              C. jejuni\n              , but both are also detected in wild animals.\n              Salmonella enterica\n              serovar Typhimurium is the most common cause of human salmonellosis in Australia; however,\n              Salmonella enterica\n              serovar Wangata is associated with sporadic human outbreaks in New South Wales and wild animals may be a potential reservoir. To determine if wild grey‐headed flying foxes (GHFF;\n              Pteropus poliocephalus\n              ) are reservoirs of\n              Salmonella\n              and\n              Campylobacter\n              , faecal samples were collected from three GHFF colonies in New South Wales and cultured for the presence of\n              Salmonella\n              and\n              Campylobacter\n              . One\n              Salmonella\n              isolate was cultured from 254 GHFF faecal samples (0.39%). Whole genome sequencing was used to genetically characterise the\n              Salmonella\n              isolate and perform phylogenetic analysis. The GHFF isolate was determined to be\n              Salmonella\n              Typhimurium ST19. The GHFF isolate carried a virulence plasmid and other virulence factors, but did not exhibit antimicrobial resistance. Phylogenetic analysis determined that the GHFF isolate was most closely related to a cluster of six isolates: four from human salmonellosis cases in Queensland and two from Australian livestock. Neither\n              Campylobacter\n              nor\n              Salmonella\n              Wangata were cultured from the 254 GHFF faecal samples. This study concluded that wild GHFF in New South Wales are not major reservoirs for\n              Salmonella\n              , and the zoonotic risks associated with\n              S. enterica\n              carriage by urban GHFF are low for the general public.",

            "abstractNote": "Myotis vivesi (Fish-eating Myotis) is an endemic species of the Gulf of California, Mexico. In this study, a 282 bp fragment of the mtDNA control region and six microsatellites loci were used to reconstruct its demographic history using summary and coalescent based statistics. Our results suggest that M. vivesi experienced a demographic population expansion between 230,000 to 50,000 years ago. After this expansion, M. vivesi experienced a slight reduction in the effective population size between 30,000 to 5,000 years ago and a spatial expansion in the last 5,000 years. Population changes observed in M. vivesi could be related to climatic changes that occurred in the Gulf of California in the Pleistocene and Holocene periods.",

Interactions among these bats, their food plants, and the climate were studied in an Atlantic Forest area in Southeastern Brazil. Path analysis was used to estimate the strength of direct and indirect effects through which variables determine the timing of bat reproduction. Temperature had a small direct influence, but a strong indirect one. Rainfall affected bat reproduction through indirect ways. Although the consumption of Piper fruits by bats did not have a significant influence, the timing of production of Piper fruits was a strong variable directly affecting bat reproduction. We therefore suggest that Piper plants and climate may play a keyrole in the timing of reproduction in C. perspicillata bats.",

Bats are reservoirs for several different coronaviruses in the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera. They also appear to be the natural reservoir for the ancestral viruses that generated the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreaks. Here, we detected coronavirus sequences in next-generation sequence data created from Eonycteris spelaea faeces and urine. We also screened by PCR urine samples, faecal samples and rectal swabs collected from six species of bats in Singapore between 2011 and 2014, all of which were negative. The phylogenetic analysis indicates this novel strain is most closely related to lineage D Betacoronaviruses detected in a diverse range of bat species. This is the second time that coronaviruses have been detected in cave nectar bats, but the ﬁrst coronavirus sequence data generated from this species. Bat species from which this group of coronaviruses has been detected are widely distributed across SE Asia, South Asia and Southern China. They overlap geographically, often share roosting sites and have been witnessed to forage on the same plant. The addition of sequence data from this group of viruses will allow us to better understand coronavirus evolution and host speciﬁcity.",

            "abstractNote": "Mammalian sperm capacitation involves biochemical and physiological changes, such as an increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i), hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane potential and sperm hyperactivation, among others. These changes provide sperm with the ability to fertilize. In the bat Corynorhinus mexicanus, there is an asynchrony between spermatogenesis and sperm storage in the male with the receptivity of the female. For instance, in C. mexicanus, spermatogenesis occurs before the reproductive season. During the reproductive period, sperm are stored in the epididymis for a few months and the testis undergoes a regression, indicating low or almost null sperm production. Therefore, it is unclear whether the elements necessary for sperm fertilization success undergo maturation or preparation during epididymis storage. Here, we characterized pH-sensitive motility hyperactivation and Ca2+ influx in sperm, regulated by alkalinization and progesterone. In addition, by electrophysiological recordings, we registered currents that were stimulated by alkalinization and inhibited by RU1968 (a CatSperspecific inhibitor), strongly suggesting that these currents were evoked via CatSper, a sperm Ca2+-specific channel indispensable for mammalian fertilization. We also found hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, such as in other mammalian species, which increased according to the month of capture, reaching the biggest hyperpolarization during the mating season. In conclusion, our results suggest that C. mexicanus sperm have functional CatSper and undergo a capacitation-like process such as in other mammals, particularly Ca2+ influx and membrane potential hyperpolarization.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Increased cattle ranching in Neotropical landscapes has led to human–wildlife conflicts that complicate the relationship between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation. We review the literature related to conflicts between livestock production and the common vampire bat\n              Desmodus rotundus\n              , specifically, the factors that influence the incidence of problems caused by bites to cattle. We summarise the strategies proposed to reduce these problems and propose actions from the perspectives of cattle management, landscape ecology and the biology of the common vampire bat. The literature shows that free‐range extensive management systems, where cattle graze in areas with forest cover, near riparian zones, caves, secondary vegetation (generally shrublands and immature trees), and vegetation fragments and edges, increase the implications and the severity of the conflict. As a result of different selection forces, the wing morphology and echolocation characteristics of the common vampire bat facilitate its movement under these landscape conditions, thus favouring a scenario of greater interaction with cattle. We propose the establishment of a ‘buffer zone’ to separate the cattle as far as possible (at least 1 km) from the elements of the landscape that are key for the movement patterns of common vampire bats in cattle ranching areas. The feeding events of this species are positively associated with host availability and landscape elements that provide habitat and connectivity, which shows that the cause of this conflict originates from the process of cattle production and the invasion of the habitat of the common vampire bat. Anti‐rabies vaccination programmes in cattle and forest–cattle separation are the most important strategies to minimise conflict and prevent rabies outbreaks.\n            \n          , \n            RESUMEN EN ESPAÑOL\n            \n              El aumento de la ganadería en paisajes neotropicales ha llevado a conflictos entre humanos y vida silvestre, que complican la relación entre la producción agropecuaria y la conservación de la biodiversidad. Revisamos la literatura relacionada con los conflictos entre la producción ganadera y el murciélago vampiro común\n              Desmodus rotundus\n              , específicamente, los factores que influyen en la incidencia de los problemas causados por las mordeduras al ganado. Resumimos las estrategias propuestas para reducir estos problemas y proponemos acciones desde las perspectivas del manejo del ganado, la ecología del paisaje y la biología del murciélago vampiro común. La literatura muestra que los sistemas de manejo extensivo, donde el ganado pasta en áreas con cobertura forestal, cerca de zonas ribereñas, cuevas, vegetación secundaria, fragmentos y bordes de vegetación, aumentan las implicaciones y la severidad del conflicto. Como resultado de diferentes fuerzas de selección, la morfología alar y las características de ecolocalización del murciélago vampiro común facilitan su movimiento en estas condiciones del paisaje, favoreciendo así un escenario de mayor interacción con el ganado. Proponemos el establecimiento de una ‘zona de amortiguamiento’ para separar el ganado lo más lejos posible (al menos 1 km) de los elementos del paisaje que son clave para el patrón de movimiento del murciélago vampiro común en áreas ganaderas. Los eventos de alimentación de esta especie se asocian positivamente con la disponibilidad de hospederos y elementos del paisaje que brindan hábitat y conectividad, lo que demuestra que la causa de este conflicto se origina en el proceso de producción ganadera y la invasión del hábitat del murciélago vampiro común. Los programas de vacunación antirrábica en el ganado bovino y la separación entre el bosque y el ganado son las estrategias más importantes para minimizar los conflictos y prevenir los brotes de rabia.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are essential to the global ecosystem, but their ability to harbour a range of pathogens has been widely discussed, as well as their role in the emergence and reemergence of infectious diseases. This paper describes the first report of coinfection by two zoonotic agents, rabies virus (RABV) and the fungus Histoplasma suramericanum in a bat. The bat was from the Molossus molossus species, and it was found during the daytime in the hallway of a public psychiatric hospital in a municipality in São Paulo State, southeastern Brazil. RABV infection was diagnosed by the direct fluorescent antibody test and mouse inoculation test. The fungus was isolated by in vitro culture. Both diagnoses were confirmed by molecular techniques. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the fungus isolate had proximity to H. suramericanum in the Lam B clade, while the RABV isolate was characterized in the Lasiurus cinereus lineage. Since the M. molossus bat was found in a peri-urban transition area (urban/periurban), the possibility of cross-species transmission of this RABV lineage becomes more plausible, considering that this scenario may provide shelter for both M. molossus and L. cinereus. These are relevant findings since there has been an increase in bat populations in urban and peri-urban areas, particularly due to environmental modifications and anthropogenic impacts on their habitat. Thus, the detection of two zoonotic agents in a bat found in a public hospital should raise awareness regarding the importance of systematic surveillance actions directed towards bats in urban areas.",

We hypothesized that tooth wear reduces the ability to consume hard-bodied insects, such as beetles, and that older E. fuscus (those with worn canines) would thus include fewer beetles in their diet than younger individuals (those with less-worn canines) do. We examined 600 fecal pellets collected from 60 female bats captured at a single maternity colony in southeastern Alberta, Canada. The diets of two groups were similar in composition, despite considerable differences in canine wear. Diets were dominated by beetles (Coleoptera), which accounted for 30 to 40% of the identifiable food items. Younger bats included more beetles in their diet, although the difference was not statistically significant. The results suggest that older bats are still able to use their worn canines to effectively puncture hard exoskeleton, perhaps because of the angular shape of the worn teeth.",

Twenty-three morphological characters were measured from\n161 specimens of\n              Myotis\n              . Differences among species for morphological characters\nwere examined using analysis of variance and discriminant analysis. A\nbootstrap procedure was used to validate the final discriminant model using\nall six species. Differences were observed among species for all 23 characters\nmeasured in univariate tests, but the range of values for most species overlapped\nthe range of other species. Bootstrap analyses indicated that our discriminant\nfunctions constructed using both external and cranial measures\nallowed correct identification of 99.4% of specimens examined. Discriminant\nmodels constructed using only cranial characters permitted correct identification of 96.9% of specimens examined. Univariate analyses were not\nreliable because variation within species prevented unambiguous identification\nof any species based on a single character. However,\n              Myotis\n              species in the\nsoutheastern United States can be distinguished with a high level of accuracy\nusing multivariate techniques when a sufficient number of measurements are\nused.",

To test the hypothesis that postemergent WNS-infected bats recover from infection with G. destructans, 30 little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) were collected in May 2009 from a WNS-affected hibernation site in New Jersey. All bats were confirmed to be infected with G. destructans using a noninvasive fungal tape method to identify the conidia of G. destructans and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The bats were then held in captivity and given supportive care for 70 days. Of the 26 bats that survived and were humanely killed after 70 days, 25 showed significant improvement in the external appearance of wing membranes, had no microscopic evidence of infection by G. destructans, and had wing tissue samples that were negative for G. destructans by PCR. A subset of the bats was treated topically at the beginning of the rehabilitation study with a dilute vinegar solution, but treatment with vinegar provided no added advantage to recovery. Provision of supportive care to homeothermic bats was sufficient for full recovery from WNS. One bat at day 70 still had both gross pathology and microscopic evidence of WNS in wing membranes and was PCR-positive for G. destructans. Dense aggregates of neutrophils surrounded the hyphae that remained in the wing membrane of this bat.",

In this study, summer roost site selection of pregnant and lactating soprano pipistrelles were investigated using radio telemetry (2004–2006) in a fiord landscape with complex topography at the species northern extreme. The soprano pipistrelles’ common roost sites were in hollow trees (n = 14), but they also used crevices in rock walls (n = 2) and the attic of one building. The bats exclusively sought out roosts on the north side of the fiord with the slope facing south, where solar irradiation yielded the warmest micro climate. From 2005 to 2014, bat boxes were erected at three sites in the study area. From 2012 to 2014 we only found maternity roosts in such structures, thus there was a clear shift in roost site selection by the soprano pipistrelle in the study area. Man-made structures, such as buildings and bat boxes, provided the warmest cavities, whereas natural cavities did not differ significantly from air temperatures. The bats did not find thermo neutral roosts most of the time, and this should affect the energy budgets, and thus the bats´ behaviour. Direct observation of predation at roosts in build-up areas suggests that living close to humans could be costly to bats emerging in daylight conditions. No predation attempts were recorded at roosts in woodland habitats.",

We trained Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bats (Epomophorus wahlbergi) captured in Pretoria, South Africa, to wear latex masks while hanging in respirometry chambers, and we measured respiratory evaporative water loss (REWL) and cutaneous evaporative water loss (CEWL) over air temperatures (Ta) from 10Њ to 40ЊC. The bats’ normothermic body temperature (Tb) was approximately 36ЊC, which increased at higher Ta to 40.5Њ ע 1.0ЊC at Ta ≈ 40ЊC. Both TEWL and resting metabolic rate (RMR) increased sharply at Ta 135ЊC, with a mean TEWL at 40ЊC equivalent to 411% of that at 30ЊC. The increase in TEWL was driven by large increases in both CEWL and REWL. CEWL comprised more than 50% of TEWL over the entire Ta range, with the exception of Ta ≈ 40ЊC, where REWL accounted for 58% of evaporative water loss. Surface area–speciﬁc CEWL increased approximately sixfold with increasing Ta. Thermoregulation at Ta approaching or exceeding Tb involved a considerable energetic cost, with RMR at Ta ≈ 40ЊC exceeding by 24% that measured at Ta ≈ 10ЊC. Our data do not support recent arguments that respiratory gas exchange across the wing membranes represents 5%–10% of the total in E. wahlbergi.",

However, little is known about how these viruses interact with their natural hosts. We demonstrate a Betacoronavirus (subgenus Merbecovirus), PN-bCoV, in the intestine of its natural host, Nathusius’s Pipistrelle Bat (Pipistrellus nathusii), by combining molecular and microscopy techniques. Eighty-eight P. nathusii bat carcasses were tested for PN-bCoV RNA by RT-qPCR, of which 25 bats (28%) tested positive. PN-bCoV RNA was more often detected in samples of the intestinal tract than in other sample types. In addition, viral RNA loads were higher in intestinal samples compared to other sample types, both on average and in each individual bat. In one bat, we demonstrated Merbecovirus antigen and PN-bCoV RNA expression in intestinal epithelium and the underlying connective tissue using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. These results indicate that PN-bCoV has a tropism for the intestinal epithelium of its natural host, Nathusius’s Pipistrelle Bat, and imply that the fecal-oral route is a possible route of transmission.",

The new record’s site, in the Moskitia region of Honduras—an extensive forested region—is located over 400 km north of the previously recognized distributional limit of the species. On 28 July 2011, we captured one female in a mist net in Nueva Esperanza, Patuca National Park, Olancho, Honduras. The specimen was caught in a pastureland adjacent to a patch of forest. It fits descriptions of size and coloration given in the literature for this species. It also was compared with some voucher specimens at Texas Tech. Univ. The captured female was pregnant. We add a new bat species to the Honduras list which gets now to 103 species.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the stages that compose the SEC of the bat Sturnira lilium, including evaluation of the average frequency of each of these stages throughout the year and calculation of the duration of the spermatogenic process. An ultrastructural characterization of the formation of the acrosomal cap was also performed. Testicular fragments were processed for morphological and immunohistochemical analysis as well as ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy. According to the tubular morphology method, the SEC in S. lilium is divided into eight stages, following the pattern found in other mammals. Primary spermatocytes were found at zygotene in stage 1 of the cycle. There was no variation in frequency of each of the stages over the seasons, with stage 1 being the most frequent, and stage 7 the least frequent. The duration of one seminiferous epithelium cycle was 3.45 days, and approximately 15.52 days were required for the development of sperm from spermatogonia. Ultrastructural characterization allowed the formation of the acrosomal cap in round spermatids to be monitored. In conclusion, the stages that compose the SEC in S. lilium are generally similar to those described for other mammals, but the duration of the spermatogenic process is shorter than previously recorded for mammals. The presence of primary spermatocytes at zygotene in stage 1 of the cycle is probably due to the longer duration of this stage.",

            "abstractNote": "Environmental factors can inﬂuence the reproductive rates in bats, and since morphometric information of bats testis is scarce, we aimed to compare the organization and quantiﬁcation of the intertubular components in the testes of the bat Molossus molossus, collected in different seasons. Testicular histological sections were evaluated using light and electron microscopy. The intertubular compartment occupied an average 10% of the testes, being predominately constituted of Leydig cells (LC). The percentages of the testes occupied by the intertubular compartment and by LC were signiﬁcantly higher in summer, while the other intertubular components did not vary signiﬁcantly among the seasons. As suspected under light microscopy, the ultrastructural analysis conﬁrmed the existence of multinucleated LC during winter. The increase in the nuclear percentage of LC in winter seems to have caused the decrease of the cytoplasmatic measurements in that season, as well as in the volume of LC. The highest cytoplasmatic values and volume of LC registered in the spring, summer, and fall can be related to greater activity of this cell in these seasons. The higher investment in intertubular tissue and in LC observed in summer, compared to winter; suggest an increase in the steroidogenic capacity of this bat during summer. The analyses correlating testicular morphometry and abiotic environmental factors in this study conﬁrm the inﬂuence of climatic factors on the reproduction of M. molossus. Microsc. Res.

The smaller dog-faced dwarf\n              Molossops temminckii\n              is distributed from Colombia to Argentina and has a wide morphological variation and vocal plasticity. In Colombia, this species remains poorly known. To fill distributional gaps, we present novel records from Arauca, Atlántico, Bolívar, Córdoba, and Huila departments. We also present an analysis of the morphometric variation in South America using Principal Component Analyses. These show an external and cranial difference of specimens of Colombia in respect of other and South America populations. In Colombian landscapes dominated by the floodplain savanna of the Orinoco region,\n              Molossops temminckii\n              is smaller than in the other regions of the country, and the previously suggested existence of cryptic diversity within the taxon should be evaluated. Therefore, we suggest further integrative analyses to investigate a possible subspecific status of some Colombian populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Recent ecological theories propose that species reach their highest abundance and genetic diversity in the center of their ecological niche and decline toward the edges. We assessed whether Lyle's ﬂying fox, Pteropus lylei, abundance and genetic diversity were correlated with niche centroid distance using an ecological niche model as a proxy for fundamental niche (NF). Alternatively, we assessed whether P. lylei abundance and genetic diversity were correlated with ﬁne-scale environmental factors as a proxy of the species’ realized niche (NR). We examined relationships between abundance and environmental factors at coarse and ﬁne scales as proxies of NF and NR, respectively. For coarse scale, ecological niche of P. lylei was modeled using all available occurrence records in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, coupled with climatic data. We conducted ﬁeld measurements of P. lylei abundance and used genetic structure data across a large portion of the species’ range. We measured Euclidean distances between abundance and genetic data and the niche centroid in environmental dimensions. Spearman’s correlation was estimated between abundance and genetic diversity vs. distance to the niche centroid. Complementarily, for the ﬁne-scale test, we measured multiple regression models between abundance and genetic diversity versus the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), local temperature, percent area of waterbodies, human density, and number of Buddhist temples. We failed to detect relationships between abundance and genetic diversity with the distance to the niche centroid in the coarse-scale model. When using the ﬁne-scale, landscape-level data, we found negative correlation between genetic diversity and number of temples. The data available were unable to support niche centroid hypothesis for the current distribution and abundances of P. lylei. We note that our failure to ﬁnd an association does not support nor reject the niche centroid hypothesis. Instead, our capacity to test the niche centroid hypothesis may be limited by our ability to use empirical data to accurately reconstruct NF from ﬁeld observations only. Future research may require physiology-based experimental approaches to explore relationships between species abundances and the niche structure.",

Furthermore, outdoor access has not been quantified in domestic animals as a risk factor with respect to latitude or parasite transmission pathway. Cats are an ideal model to test parasitic infection risk in outdoor animals because there have been many studies analysing this risk factor in this species; and there is a useful dichotomy in cat ownership between indoor-only cats and those with outdoor access. Thus, we used meta-analysis to determine whether outdoor access is a significant risk factor for parasitic infection in domestic pet cats across 19 different pathogens including many relevant to human, domestic animal and wildlife health, such as\n              Toxoplasma gondii\n              and\n              Toxocara cati\n              . Cats with outdoor access were 2.77 times more likely to be infected with parasites than indoor-only cats. Furthermore, absolute latitude trended towards significance such that each degree increase in absolute latitude increased infection likelihood by 4%. Thus, restricting outdoor access can reduce the risk of parasitic infection in cats and reduce the risk of zoonotic parasite transmission, spillover to sympatric wildlife and negative impacts on feline health.",

We asked whether the passage of Cecropia pachystachya (Urticaceae) seeds through guts of bats influences their germination behavior, specifically the proportion of germinated seeds and onset and speed of germination. We collected seed sets from bat feces and directly from ripe fruits monthly for a total of 6 months, in the urban area of Campo Grande, Central Brazil. Seeds were stored in glycerol until the germination experiment. During the experiment, for 45 days we maintained seed sets in a germinator and recorded daily seed development. Through redundancy correlation analysis, the interaction between seed source (fruits or bat feces) and time of storage explained 78% of variation in the germination parameters—the onset and speed of germination and the percentage of germinated seeds. Through data generated from random resamples, seed sets defecated by bats presented slower germination speed than seeds from ripe fruits, but onset of germination and proportion of germinated seeds did not differ between seeds passed or not passed through Artibeus lituratus and Artibeus planirostris. Overall, our results support that fruit bats are safe dispersers of C. pachystachya and promote asynchrony of germination among seeds, which may favor parental fitness in less predictable environments.",

However, the effects of bats on seed germination have been scarcely addressed. Here, we evaluate effects of passage of seeds through guts of Artibeus lituratus bats on the germination of the pioneer tree Cecropia pachystachya, accounting for seed storage time and fruit maturity as covariates. To control for seed sources, we collected infructescences and offered them partially to captive bats in order to obtain seeds passed through bats and seeds unpassed from the same infructescences. We then stored in glycerol subsets of seeds of both treatments through time until the beginning of the germination experiment. Germination success responded to storage time and fruit maturation stage. Among seeds from unripe fruits, those passed through the bat guts showed higher percentage of germination than seeds unpassed, but no difference occurred between treatments for seeds from mature fruits. In addition, passage through bats positively affected germination speed, irrespective of fruit maturity. Overall results support that bats can promote germination of C. pachystachya seeds, in addition to seed dispersal.",

Individuals of both wild and manipulated populations are self‐incompatible, indicating that artificial selection has not modified the breeding system. Their pollination biology is also similar. Anthesis is mainly nocturnal, with a peak of nectar production between 0200 and 0400 when the stigma presents maximum turgidity. Nocturnal visitors are the effective pollinators. Nearly 75% of flowers exposed for nocturnal pollination set fruit, while none of the flowers exposed for diurnal pollination produced fruits. The bats\n              Leptonycteris curasoae, L. nivalis\n              , and\n              Choeronycteris mexicana\n              (Glossophaginae) are the most likely pollinators, and their time of foraging is synchronized with the time of nectar production and stigma receptivity in\n              S. stellatus\n              . Bats potentially move pollen over a considerable distance, so there is apparently no spatial isolation to prevent pollen exchange between wild and cultivated populations. Phenological studies showed that there are also no apparent temporal barriers. However, manual cross pollination failed between some domesticated and wild phenotypes, suggesting that gene flow between wild and cultivated populations might be limited by pollen incompatibility.",

The new species is included in Torrestrongylus because it features a bursa of the type 3 – 2, a divided cephalic vesicle with an anterior half in the shape of an umbrella, and a posterior widened half. The new species can be distinguished from the only other congener T. torrei Pérez-Vigueras, 1935 by four key features: ﬁrst, by the absence of cervical alae in both males and females; second, by the relatively longer second half of the cephalic cap; third, by the conﬁguration of the dorsal ray, that does not have a medial terminal ray, and ﬁnally, by the structure of the spicules. This is the second species in the genus, previously known from bats of the families Phyllostomidae and Molossidae in Cuba, and now in Mexico.",

            "abstractNote": "All bats possess eyes that are of adaptive value. Echolocating bats have retinae dominated by rod photoreceptors and use dim light vision for navigation, and in rare cases for hunting. However, the visual detection threshold of insectivorous echolocating bats remains unknown. Here, we determined this threshold for the vespertilionid bat Myotis daubentonii. We show that for a green luminous target, M. daubentonii has a visual luminance threshold of 3.2(±0.9)×10−4 cd m−2, an intensity corresponding to the luminance of an open cloudless terrestrial habitat on a starlit night. Our results show that echolocating bats have good visual sensitivity, allowing them to see during their active periods. Together with previous results showing that M. daubentonii has poor visual acuity (∼0.6 cycles deg−1), this suggests that echolocating bats do not use vision to hunt but rather to orient themselves.",

            "abstractNote": "The ﬂoral biology and pollination ecology of durian, Durio zibethinus, were determined in eight semi-wild trees in mixed-fruit orchards in southern Thailand during April-May 2003 and 2005. Flowers open fully at 16h00–16h30 and most androecia drop around 01h00. Anthers dehisce at 19h30–20h00 when the stigmata are already receptive. In a series of pollination experiments, fruit was set in all treatments within 10 d. The greatest pollination success occurred after hand-crossed (76.6%), open (54.4%) and emasculation pollination (53.3%). Consistently, hand-crossed (12.2%), emasculation (8.7%) and open pollination (5.1%) yielded a substantial fruit set 2 mo after the pollination experiments. Very low pollination success in facilitated autogamy suggests that most durian trees are highly self incompatible. No mature fruit was found after insect pollination and automatic autogamy. Fruit bats, especially Eonycteris spelaea, are the major pollinators of this durian although the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) was the most frequent visitor to the ﬂowers. Bats visited durian ﬂowers at the rate of 26.1 (SD = 20.7) visits per inﬂorescence per night. Since this semi-wild durian depends on fruit bats as its pollinator, protecting fruit bat populations and their roosts is vital for the production of the durian fruit crop.",

Feces from netted bats were analyzed, and the recapture rate determined. Although both species share a set of food plants, and fruits from early successional forest contribute about half of their diet, C. brachyotis, the smaller of the two species, ate a signiﬁcantly greater proportion of fruits from early successional forest than C. sphinx. The latter ate a signiﬁcantly greater proportion of fruit species in larger size classes. More C. brachyotis were captured in early successional forest in almost every month, while C. sphinx is more common in old-growth forest. However, the capture rate of C. sphinx increased in early successional forest in the mid-dry season when its preferred fruits become available. The recapture rate of C. brachyotis in early successional forest was signiﬁcantly higher than that of C. sphinx, and the reverse situation was observed in old-growth forest. Male C. sphinx had a signiﬁcantly higher recapture rate in early successional forest than females. Fruit size and habitat use are the major determinants of resource partitioning between these size-overlapping congeners.",

            "abstractNote": "During a laboratory study of pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) hunting behavior, we observed an interaction wherein an adult female appeared to aid a juvenile male in learning a novel foraging task. This single observation adheres to the 3 requirements of teaching outlined by Caro and Hauser (1992). A female bat experienced with a hunting task modified her behavior in the presence of a naïve observing male, resulting in a cost of reduced food availability to the female when she was hungry, while directing the male to food resources and accelerating his learning of a foraging task. The experienced female bat altered her behavior in the presence of a naïve male by nonaggressively approaching the perched male several times before flying to a bowl of live mealworms. Within minutes, her behavior led to the initiation of the foraging task by the naïve male. In sharp contrast, 5 other bats took 4–12 nights to learn this foraging task. Audio recordings of contact calls made during the interaction show possible information transfer via acoustic signals. We hope this lone observation will stimulate research on teaching in bats.",
