Aiming at a better understanding of the dynamics of these processes, male little yellow-shouldered bats (Sturnira lilium) were captured during both the dry and rainy seasons and their reproductive and metabolic patterns were established. Testes were processed histologically for morphometric analysis by light microscopy. Plasma glucose and testosterone concentrations were determined, as well as liver and muscle glycogen, lipids, and protein. Data showed little variation in testicular morphometrical parameters and also in body energy reserves between the seasons evaluated. We conclude that occasional season variations in bodily energy reserves in S. lilium do not seem to present a major inﬂuence on testicular morphometry in this species, which may reﬂect a successful adaptation of S. lilium to its habitats.",

Along the east coast, its range is thought to extend as far south as the Great Dismal Swamp in coastal Virginia. We captured six M. septentrionalis in the northern coastal plain region of North Carolina. Field identiﬁcation was based on characters of ear and tragus length and conﬁrmed with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences. These captures signify the presence of a resident population of M. septentrionalis in the northern coastal plain of North Carolina. Future work is needed to document range limits and hibernation behavior of this species in the piedmont and coastal plain of North Carolina.",

Bats are now recognized as a potential wildlife reservoir for a diverse number of Bartonella species, including the zoonotic Candidatus B. mayotimonensis. These bat-borne Bartonella species have also been detected in the obligate ectoparasites of bats, such as blood-feeding ﬂies, which could transmit these bacteria within bat populations. To better understand this potential for transmission, we investigated the relatedness between Bartonella detected or isolated from bat hosts sampled in Mexico and their ectoparasites. Bartonella spp. were identiﬁed in bat ﬂies collected on two bat species, with the highest prevalence in Trichobius parasiticus and Strebla wiedemanni collected from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). When comparing Bartonella sequences from a fragment of the citrate synthase gene (gltA), vectorassociated strains were diverse and generally close to, but distinct from, those recovered from their bacteremic bat hosts in Mexico. Complete Bartonella sequence concordance was observed in only one bat-vector pair. The diversity of Bartonella strains in bat ﬂies reﬂects the frequent host switch by bat ﬂies, as they usually do not live permanently on their bat host. It may also suggest a possible endosymbiotic relationship with these vectors for some of the Bartonella species carried by bat ﬂies, whereas others could have a mammalian host.",

Just before prey capture, the terminal frequency (TF) of emitted sounds decreased, and the beam width (mean 6 standard deviation) expanded from 40 6 10  to 63 6 9  (horizontal) and from 32 6 10  to 52 6 7  (vertical). P. abramus decrease the TF to simultaneously expand the beam width in both the horizontal and vertical planes, while retaining the target within the threedimensional acoustic ﬁeld of view at the ﬁnal stage of capture.",

We describe a real-time TaqMan PCR test that detects DNA from G. destructans by targeting a portion of the multicopy intergenic spacer region of the rRNA gene complex. The test is highly sensitive, consistently detecting as little as 3.3 fg genomic DNA from G. destructans. The real-time PCR test specifically amplified genomic DNA from G. destructans but did not amplify target sequence from 54 closely related fungal isolates (including 43 Geomyces spp. isolates) associated with bats. The test was qualified further by analyzing DNA extracted from 91 bat wing skin samples, and PCR results matched histopathology findings. These data indicate the real-time TaqMan PCR method described herein is a sensitive, specific and rapid test to detect DNA from G. destructans and provides a valuable tool for WNS diagnostics and research.",

            "abstractNote": "Total evaporative water loss is the sum of respiratory water loss (RWL) and cutaneous water loss (CWL) and constitutes the main avenue of water loss in bats. Because bats ﬂy and have large surface-to-volume ratios, they potentially have high rates of RWL and CWL. Most species of small insectivorous bats have the ability to reduce their body temperature (Tb) at rest, which substantially reduces energy expenditure and water loss. We hypothesized that bats reduce evaporative water loss during bouts of deep hypothermia (torpor) by decreasing RWL and CWL. We measured Tb, RWL, CWL, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) in Kuhl’s pipistrelle Pipistrellus kuhlii, a small insectivorous bat. In support of our hypothesis, we found that RWL decreased with decreasing RMR. We found that CWL was lower in torpid individuals than in normothermic bats; however, bats in deep torpor had similar or higher CWL than bats in shallow torpor, suggesting that they exert a less effective physiological control over CWL when in deep torpor. Because insectivorous bats spend most of their lives in torpor or hibernation, the regulation of CWL in different heterothermic states has relevant ecological and evolutionary consequences.",

Roost occupancy patterns and characteristics of palm trees or palm oases important for roost selection across the Colorado Desert are unknown. We surveyed 41 palm oasis sites throughout the Colorado Desert and found 33 of those locations to have western yellow bat activity, and we conﬁrmed day roosts at 19 sites. Compared to unoccupied palm sites, bats were found roosting in palm oases that were at higher elevations, had evidence of new palm growth, and where palms had a full range of skirt lengths. Our ﬁndings have implications for managing palm oases for western yellow bats.",

            "abstractNote": "In the absence of visual cues, chemical signals are especially important for nocturnal mammals such as bats, because they facilitate individual recognition, communication, and mate selection. In a recent study, it was reported that adult males of the Curaçaoan longnosed bat, Leptonycteris curasoae, develop an odoriferous dorsal patch during the short mating season. It was postulated that dorsal patches signal health condition to females, and that females are preferentially attracted to the odor of males with dorsal patches. The chemical characterization of the dorsal patch is key to understanding its implications in chemical communication in a sexual context. In the present study, organic compounds collected from dorsal patches of males of L. curasoae from northwestern Venezuela were extracted using solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) techniques and tentatively identified using GC-MS (Gas ChromatographyMass Spectrometry). Nineteen compounds were present in 75% or more of the patches examined: 3-methyl-2-buten-1-thiol, acetic acid, 2’-aminoacetophenone, diacetyl, 2-pentanone, 2,3-dimethylpyrazine, 2-nonanone, acetamide, 2-undecanone, piperidinone, 4-methylquinazoline, 2,4-dimethylquinazoline, 3-methyl-2,5-pyrrolidinedione, 2-butanone, 2-methylfuran, 3-methyl-2-butenal, δ-valerolactone, 3-methyl-2-butenoic acid, and 2-methyl-2-butenoic acid. Although some of these compounds have been reported as important in female attraction among other male mammals during their respective breeding seasons, the actual function of these chemicals in L. curasoae remains to be determined. Some of these compounds have also been identified as natural insecticides, and this may be associated with lower ectoparasite loads reported on males with dorsal patches. These results, when considered along with previous observations, suggest that the dorsal patch in males of L. curasoae promotes the attraction of females during the mating season, and/or provides protection against ectoparasites.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats have been implicated as reservoirs of relapsing fever group spirochaetes since the beginning of the last century. Recently, bat-associated spirochaetes have been reported as human pathogens. In 1968, a spirochaete was detected in blood of the bat Natalus tumidirostris captured inside the Macaregua cave, Colombia. Data on this microorganism were never published again. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of Borrelia DNA in blood from bats of Macaregua cave. We performed molecular analyses using a genus-specific real-time PCR targeting the 16S rRNA to detect DNA of Borrelia in blood samples from 46 bats captured in the Macaregua cave. Positive samples were submitted to a battery of PCRs aiming to amply Borrelia 16S rRNA, flaB, glpQ, p66, ospC, clpA, clpX, nifS, pepX, pyrG, recG, rplB and uvrA genes. Seventeen samples were positive for Borrelia after real-time PCR. With the exception of flaB gene, attempts to amplify further loci were unsuccessful. Nucleotide and amino acid divergences of four flaB haplotypes characterized from blood of Carollia perspicillata showed Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) as the most closely related group. A phylogenetic tree including 74 sequences of the genus confirmed this trend, since Borrelia genotypes detected in bats from Macaregua formed a monophyletic group basally positioned to Bbsl. Our results suggest that Borrelia genotypes characterized from bats roosting in the Macaregua cave might constitute a new taxon within the genus. This is the first molecular characterization of a Borrelia sp. in Colombia.",

We hypothesized that diet would vary throughout the season and between years and that diet of evening bats in northern areas would differ from diet of those in more southern parts of the continent. Almost 600 fecal pellets of evening bats were collected and analyzed from May through August 2006–2007. Thirteen orders of insects and two orders of arachnids were found, but Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and Hemiptera composed 87% of dietary volume. Lepidoptera, which forms a substantial portion of the diet for most vespertilionids in eastern North America, contributed only 4.7% to the volume. Diet was broadly similar to evening bats in the core of their range, although evening bats in Michigan incorporated substantially more Diptera into their diet. Dietary composition and diversity differed little between years but showed variation among weeks within years. The lack of dietary specialization and similarity in major components in different parts of the range suggest that availability of prey or dietary competition with other species at the ordinal level are not factors limiting the northern distribution of the evening bat.",

The genus Cryptosporidium infects various vertebrates and causes a diarrheal disease known as cryptosporidiosis. Many epidemiological studies in wild animals have been performed; however, most of them relied on only PCR-based detection because of the difficulty of performing pathological analyses. Accordingly, the natural host and pathogenicity of Cryptosporidium bat genotypes remain unclear. In this study, we captured Eptesicus nilssonii (Northern bats) in Hokkaido, Japan. Of the three intestinal samples obtained, two were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. and one was positive for Eimeria spp. The corresponding microorganisms were also confirmed histopathologically. We detected the novel Cryptosporidium bat genotype XII and Eimeria rioarribaensis in bat intestine.",

            "abstractNote": "The evolution of cue reception and cue production is well documented. The ability of species to use cues they did not evolve with is important in understanding flexibility in behaviour. We observed Neotropical nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaga soricina) feeding at Old World banana flowers (Musa acuminata) in a Belize garden. The flowers produce a rich source of nectar that is exposed as a bract lifts before dusk. We tested the hypothesis that the bracts serve as beacons to foraging bats and discuss this approach and the use of acoustic information by bats feeding at flowers. We ensonified a bract with cues like those of echolocating G. soricina, which revealed the production of strong echoes from the bract. Additionally, the removal of bracts from the flowers influenced the bats’ flower-visiting behaviour. We suggest that the bats use the echoes from the bract opportunistically as a cue to find the nectar source. Our findings provide an example of an interaction between a plant and flower visitor not reflecting a shared evolutionary past.",

Pregnant bats did not use the day roost at night, but lactating females returned 2–4 times/night for 32 ± 7 (SE) min/visit, presumably to feed their young. Both pregnant and lactating females night roosted as solitary individuals in trees within their foraging areas; night roosting occurred 0–6 times/night for 14 ± 1 min each time. Bats foraged for most of the night, with the total duration of ﬂight equalling 375 ± 16 min/night. The bats used 13 different foraging areas that were located 0.5–4.2 km from the day roost. Bats did not ﬂy over open ﬁelds but travelled along wooded corridors, even though such behaviour increased commuting distance by 55 ± 11%. Current models of habitat suitability for this endangered species should be modiﬁed, taking into account the use of wooded commuting corridors and the large home range of these bats.",

We used 3D geometric morphometrics to compare the shapes of skulls of the two lineages collected at various localities in southern Africa. Size and shape variation was predominantly attributed to selective forces; the between-­population variance (B) was not proportional to the within-­population variance (W). Modularity was evident in the crania of R. simulator but absent in the crania of R. cf. simulator and the mandibles of both species. The skulls of the two lineages thus appeared to be under different selection pressures, despite the overlap in their distributions. Difference in the crania of R. cf. simulator was centered largely on the nasal dome region of R. cf. simulator but on the cranium and mandibles of R. simulator. It is likely that the size and shape of the nasal dome, which acts as a frequency-­dependent acoustic horn, is more crucial in R. cf. simulator than in R. simulator because of the higher echolocation frequencies used by R. cf. simulator. A larger nasal dome in R. cf. simulator would allow the emission of higher intensity pulses, resulting in comparable detection distances to that of R. simulator. In contrast, selection pressure is probably more pronounced on the mandibles and cranium of R. simulator to compensate for the loss in bite force because of its elongated rostrum. The predominance of selection probably reflects the stringent association between environment and the optimal functioning of phenotypic characters associated with echolocation and feeding in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Natural selection and drift can act on populations individually, simultaneously or in tandem and our understanding of phenotypic divergence depends on our ability to recognize the contribution of each. According to the quantitative theory of evolution, if an organism has diversified through neutral evolutionary processes (mutation and drift), variation of phenotypic characteristics between different geographic localities (B) should be directly proportional to the variation within localities (W), that is, B ∝ W. Significant deviations from this null model imply that non-­neutral forces such as natural selection are acting on a phenotype. We investigated the relative contributions of drift and selection to intraspecific diversity using southern African horseshoe bats as a test case. We characterized phenotypic diversity across the distributional range of Rhinolophus simulator (n = 101) and Rhinolophus swinnyi (n = 125) using several traits associated with flight and echolocation. Our results suggest that geographic variation in both species was predominantly caused by disruptive natural selection (B was not directly proportional to W). Evidence for correlated selection (co-­selection) among traits further confirmed that our results were not compatible with drift. Selection rather than drift is likely the predominant evolutionary process shaping intraspecific variation in traits that strongly impact fitness.",

To provide information on their keystone role, the study recorded instances of seed dispersal and measured seed germination rate of two and four plant species respectively. A total of 88 roosting locations (18, 20 and 50 from CCLH, RH and FRH respectively) were studied. P. voeltzkowi abundance was estimated using patch counts conducted for four days in dry season (February) and four days in wet season (April). Transect and seed germination experiment were used to estimate seeds dispersal distances and germination rates respectively. The number of P. voeltzkowi was lower in the wet season and highest in RH. A positive relationship was found between P. voeltzkowi abundance and roosting tree canopy diameter. Fruits were dominant food item recorded, eighteen tree species were utilised as day roosts and fourteen were food source for P. voeltzkowi. Compared to unhandled seeds, handled seeds showed high germination rate. Maximum dispersal distances recorded were 560 and 200m for fig and mango seeds respectively.",

Previous studies revealed the population history of R. ferrumequinum from Europe and most Asian regions, yet there continue to be arguments about their evolutionary process in Northeast Asia. In this study, we obtained mitochondrial DNA cyt b and D-loop data of R. ferrumequinum from Northeast China, South Korea and Japan to clarify their phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary process. Our results indicate a highly supported monophyletic group of Northeast Asian greater horseshoe bats, in which Japanese populations formed a single clade and clustered into the mixed branches of Northeast Chinese and South Korean populations. We infer that R. ferrumequinum in Northeast Asia originated in Northeast China and South Korea during a cold glacial period, while some ancestors likely arrived in Japan by flying or land bridge and subsequently adapted to the local environment. Consequently, during the warm Eemian interglaciation, the Korea Strait, between Japan and South Korea, became a geographical barrier to Japanese and inland populations, while the Changbai Mountains, between China and North Korea, did not play a significant role as a barrier between Northeast China and South Korea populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Evolutionary processes can be influenced by several factors, such as geographic isolation, environmental selection, and sensory variation. For most nocturnal bats, echolocation is the primary sensory system used to prey and communicate, and plays important roles in chiropteran diversification and evolution. Understanding the relative contribution of geography, the environment, and this sensory system to population genetic divergence can elucidate the processes involved in bat incipient speciation and evolution. In this study, we collected spatial and environmental information, echolocation calls, as well as the previously published genetic data (six microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene) of widely distributed Rhinolophus episcopus populations to test three hypotheses for nuclear and mitochondrial divergence (isolation by distance, isolation by environment, and isolation by sensory variation) and unveil the factors that drive intraspecific genetic differentiation. The moderate level of nuclear differentiation was correlated with geographic/ spatial distance and acoustic variation, whereas the relatively high level of mitochondrial differentiation was mainly associated with acoustic divergence. No significant correlation was observed between genetic divergence and environmental variables. Among the three factors, acoustic divergence explained the highest percentage of both nuclear and mitochondrial divergence. Thus, our results indicate that sensory variation may have played important roles in driving population isolation early in bat speciation, which is consistent with the hypothesis of isolation by sensory variation. Our study emphasizes the need to consider more factors, especially sensory traits, and combine multiple statistical methods in landscape genetic studies to test their potential contributions to driving population divergence.",

            "abstractNote": "The endangerment mechanisms of various species are a focus of studies on biodiversity and conservation biology. Hipposideros pomona is an endangered species, but the reasons behind its endangerment remain unclear. We investigated the endangerment mechanisms of H. pomona using mitochondrial DNA, nuclear DNA, and microsatellite loci markers. The results showed that the nucleotide diversity of mitochondria DNA and heterozygosity of microsatellite markers were high (π = 0.04615, HO = 0.7115), whereas the nucleotide diversity of the nuclear genes was low (THY: π = 0.00508, SORBS2: π = 0.00677, ACOX2: π = 0.00462, COPS7A: π = 0.00679). The phylogenetic tree and median-joining network based on mitochondrial DNA sequences clustered the species into three clades, namely North Vietnam-Fujian, Myanmar-West Yunnan, and Laos-Hainan clades. However, joint analysis of nuclear genes did not exhibit clustering. Analysis of molecular variance revealed a strong population genetic structure; IMa2 analysis did not reveal significant gene flow between all groups (p > .05), and isolation-by-distance analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between genetic and geographic distances (p < .05). The mismatch distribution analysis, neutral test, and Bayesian skyline plots revealed that the H. pomona population were relatively stable and exhibited a contraction trend. The results implied that H. pomona exhibits female philopatry and male-biased dispersal. The Hengduan Mountains could have acted as a geographical barrier for gene flow between the North Vietnam-Fujian clade and the Myanmar-West Yunnan clade, whereas the Qiongzhou Strait may have limited interaction between the Hainan populations and other clades. The warm climate during the second interglacial Quaternary period (c. 0.33 Mya) could have been responsible for species differentiation, whereas the cold climate during the late Quaternary last glacial maximum (c. 10 ka BP) might have caused the overall contraction of species. The lack of significant gene flow in nuclear microsatellite loci markers among the different populations investigated reflects recent habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities; thus, on-site conservation of the species and restoration of gene flow corridors among populations need immediate implementation.",

            "abstractNote": "Haematological parameters of pond bats (Myotis dasycneme, Chiroptera), the most numerous bat species in the Ural Mountains, were investigated. Blood samples were collected from 40 wild bats. Ten haematological parameters were determined using an automated haematological analyser. Morphological differentiation of leukocytes was performed in blood smears. No significant differences were revealed in the main parameters of peripheral blood between adult males and females of Myotis dasycneme except for the content of haemoglobin (p = 0.01) and leukocytes (p = 0.02). Data show that significant differences exist between adult and subadult females in erythropoiesis (RBC, HGB, HCT, and MCV). Thus, with age, the number of erythrocytes and the haemoglobin level increase (p < 0.05), but the leukocytic chain remains relatively stable. Changes in haematological parameters were observed in the bats caught in the season of preparation for long hibernation (6–7 months). Conclusion: The blood system of Myotis dasycneme from natural populations in the Ural Mountains was investigated for the first time. It was found that bat growth and development are accompanied by significant changes in red blood cell indicators whereas the white blood cell count remains stable. Adaptive lability of red blood cells in bats allows them to respond adequately to seasonal environmental conditions.",

In general, seeds ingested showed more rapid germination times and higher overall germination rates than untreated seeds. The bat Glossophaga longirostris, and the birds Mimus gilvus and Tachyphonus rufus seem to be the most efﬁcient cacti dispersers in terms of quality of treatment. The increment of germination speed and particularly the decrease of imbibition time, could favour the probability of germination in dry areas such as arid and semi-arid environments.",

We found that Orii’s ﬂying-fox potentially pollinated seven native plant species. Its feeding behavior and plant morphological traits suggested that this species is an important pollinator of Schima wallichii liukiuensis and Mucuna macrocarpa. The ﬂying-fox also dispersed the seeds of 20 native plant species. The seeds of all plants eaten by the ﬂying-fox were usually dropped beneath the parent tree, although large fruits of four plant species were occasionally brought to the feeding roosts in the mouth, with the maximum dispersal distance—for Terminalia catappa—estimated to be 126 m. Small seeds of 11 species (mostly Ficus species) were dispersed around other trees, during the subsequent feeding session, through the digestive tracts, with the mean dispersal distance for ingested seeds estimated at 150 ± 230.3 m (±SD); the maximum dispersal distance was 1833 m. A comparison of the seed dispersal of available fruits according to the size of ﬂying-foxes and other frugivores suggested that the seed dispersal of eight plant species producing large fruits mostly depended on Orii’s ﬂying-fox. On Okinawa-jima Island, the Orii’s ﬂying-fox plays an important role as a pollinator of two native plants and as a long-distance seed disperser of Ficus species, and it functions as a limited agent of seed dispersal for plants producing large fruits on Okinawa-jima Island.",

The present subfossils include the Okinawa spiny rat Tokudaia muenninki, Ryukyu long-furred rat Diplothrix legata, Watase’s shrew Crocidura watasei, and an in­ determinate species of bat. With the exception of C. watasei, these species no longer exist in southern Okinawajima. Predominance of these rat species suggests that the environment around the fissure was densely forested during these ages. However, the presence of C. watasei remains implies that open habitats also existed in the middle Holocene. Tokudaia muenninki remains from the fissure show that it had survived on southern Okinawajima until the middle Holocene. The upper first molar widths and lower molar row lengths in the late Pleistocene T. muenninki material from the fissure are significantly smaller than those of extant conspecific specimens, whereas the upper molar row length appears to be similar to those of the extant conspecifics. These findings suggest that the molar proportions of T. muenninki have changed since the late Pleistocene.",

Our main objective was to assess the nightly and annual flight activity and to examine the influences of ambient temperature on flight activity. We tested the hypothesis that flight activity of the species is concentrated at certain periods of the night and the year using mist-netting data from 2,712 captured bats. We found no evidence for annual fluctuations in flight activity, probably due to no distinct seasonal limitation of food resources, no migration, and the lack of extreme environmental conditions in the study area. Our hypothesis of concentrated nightly flight activity was confirmed for one cave but not for the other. Flight activity was concentrated early in the night (20:00, 21:00 and 22:00 hours) at one cave, possibly to take advantage of locally available early active prey insects, while it was uniformly distributed throughout the night at the other. Lastly, we found a reduction in the flight activity of H. cf. ruber when there was a distinct drop in temperature over the night. We therefore suggest the reduction in flight activity may result from the direct effects of temperature on prey abundance as the bats responded by reducing activity to avoid excessive prey search costs.",

Local convex hulls were used to estimate home range sizes of the bats. Based on 1,192 fixes, the mean (± SD) home range size was 36 ha ± 35 ha. Individual home range size ranged from six to 95 ha and frequently overlapped among individuals. The foraging area covered 50% of the home range while the core area formed 2%. The mean maximum foraging distance was 1.1 km, with individual distances up to 2.6 km, suggesting Hipposideros aff. ruber is capable of covering relatively long distances. Male bats returned to the cave more often than females during the night. Although the cave was the main roost, each bat also had individual night roosts on trees.",

            "abstractNote": "In sub-Saharan Africa, anthropogenic activities such as cocoa (Theobroma cacao) farming have replaced the natural forest vegetation, making agricultural environments more readily available to some species of bats. To augment bat conservation in such highly modified agro-environments, we evaluated the foraging decisions of the widely distributed Noack’s round-leaf bat (Hipposideros aff. ruber) in a Ghanaian agro-environment for two factors: (a) foraging durations and (b) habitat selection from radio telemetry data collected from 13 bats. We hypothesized that it opportunistically selects foraging habitats in proportion to its availability. Our compositional analysis revealed, however, a nonrandom use of habitats. A ranking matrix indicated Hipposideros aff. ruber uses all available habitats but strongly preferred seminatural habitats dominated by fallow lands. Cocoa farms were predominantly used as flight paths for commuting between roosts and other nearby habitats during foraging. We observed a mean foraging duration of 109 min (SD ¼ 62 min) per night for the species. In conclusion, our data suggest that (a) they are flexible in selecting all habitat types in the agro-environment but strongly preferred fallow matrices, (b) the provision of canopy trees within the agro-environment serves as flight paths for commuting from roost to habitats offering higher prey densities, and (3) the maintenance of fallow matrices as conservation units in sub-Saharan agro-environments helps augment conservation efforts of the species.",

Here, we report a case of dicephalic parapagus conjoined twins in the Neotropical phyllostomid genus Artibeus. These twins are males and present separated heads and necks, but a conjoined trunk with an expanded upper thoracic region. They developed two complete forelimbs and two complete hindlimbs, all laterally to the trunk. There is a volume in the upper midback and between the heads that resembles a third rudimentary medial forelimb, but X-ray images only suggest the presence of medial skeletal elements of the pectoral girdle (clavicle and scapulae) in this region. The X-ray images also show that vertebral columns run separated from head until the base of lumbar region, where they form a single structure. Using ultrasound images, we detected the presence of two similarly sized and apparently separated hearts. The accumulation of study cases like this will help in the understanding of patterns and process behind this phenomena, and collection material plays a key role in this context.",

In this paper, the hypothesis that morphological adaptations related to granivory have evolved in these bats is investigated and discussed. A canonical variate analysis was used to search for possible divergent trends between the masticatory apparatus of Chiroderma and other stenodermatines currently recognized in the same ensemble. A total of 142 specimens representative of eight species was included in the analysis. Species of Chiroderma can be discriminated from all other species in the sample based on the increased development of masseter-related variables (height of the anterior zygomatic arch, masseter moment arm, and masseter volume), which, in conjunction with other morphological characteristics (dentition and gape angle) discussed herein, corroborates the evolution of durophagy in this group. A complementary analysis based on a Mantel test revealed that the pattern of morphological differentiation that emerged from the canonical variate analysis does not agree with the one expected based solely on the phylogenetic relationships adopted for the canopy fruit-bats studied here. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that morphological adaptations related to granivory have evolved in Chiroderma.",

            "abstractNote": "Cochlear morphology has been regarded as one of the key traits to understand the origin and evolution of echolocation in bats, given its functionality and performance for receiving echolocation sonar. While numerous researchers have compared adult-stage morphology, few have studied the prenatal development of the cochlea. Here, we provide the first detailed three-dimensional description of the prenatal cranial development in bats, using Rhinolophus thomasi as a model, with particular interest to the petrosal which houses the cochlea. Results revealed that among all cranial bones the onset of the ossification of the petrosal is earlier in R. thomasi when compared to other reported mammals. Generally, the cochlea reaches adult size and shape before or around birth in placental mammals including bats, but we found that its shape and size growths continue until maturity in Rhinolophus species. The relationship of cochlear size and skull size is maintained constant throughout the postnatal ontogeny to adulthood in Rhinolophus, a pattern previously reported neither in any other bats nor other mammals. The peculiar developmental pattern in Rhinolophus possibly allows them to form their characteristically large cochlea and facilitate their distinctive echolocation behavior. A recent study reported that non-echolocating Pteropodidae shares a similar prenatal cochlear size to laryngeal echolocating bats. The apparent resemblance of fetal cochlear size was proposed to be a vestigial signal of large cochlear size in the last common ancestor of bats and thus as supporting evidence for the single origin of laryngeal echolocation. However, results from the present observations suggest that limited aspects of the cochlear development were captured in this previous investigation and that the resulting interpretations may be questionable. We point out that diversity and patterns of cochlear development among bats are still not resolved, and the controversy on the origins of laryngeal echolocation is still open to discussion.",

Few studies of phenology exist for any hibernating species and those that do address species which mate during spring. We used passive transponders (PIT tags) to study hibernation phenology of little brown bats Myotis lucifugus, a species that mates prior to hibernation in the fall. We expected that adult females would emerge earliest as early parturition increases juvenile survival. We predicted that females with large fat stores should emerge earliest because of their ability to tolerate inclement spring weather at the maternity roost. We also predicted that adult males would remain active later than females to maximize mating opportunities and compensate for body mass decline during the mating period. We implanted 475 bats with PIT tags and remotely recorded immergence and emergence timing at a hibernaculum in central Canada. As expected, adult males were active signiﬁcantly later (median immergence date = 16 September 2011) than adult females (11 September 2011) and adult females emerged earlier (median emergence date = 6 May 2012) than both adult males (25 May 2012) and subadults (13 May 2012). Emergence timing was correlated with fall body condition in adult females, with fatter females emerging earlier, but not males. Our results highlight the importance of reproductive timing as an inﬂuence on hibernation phenology of mammals.",

Individuals of midge cultures reared in 10 different laboratories showed a clear reduction in the number of alleles per locus and in the level of heterozygosity compared to two natural populations sampled in southern Germany. To reconstruct the rate of genetic impoverishment under laboratory conditions, genetic diversity was monitored in a C. riparius laboratory population for 23 generations. Additionally, 11 populations originating from different laboratories were crossed, and genetic diversity was compared among pure, crossed, and natural populations. The results demonstrate that C. riparius strains used in standard toxicity tests exhibit low levels of genetic variability. In addition, our experiments show that refreshment of stocks with individuals from other laboratories is not sufﬁcient to restore genetic variation. Potential consequences of genetic impoverishment and improvements for toxicological bioassays are discussed.",

Bats were screened for Bartonella spp. by culture and confirmed by PCR and sequencing for the gltA gene. Bartonella cultures were obtained from blood specimens of 9/51 (18%) individuals from three species (Artibeus jamaicensis, Brachyphylla cavernarum, and Monophyllus redmani). Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA sequences showed that M. redmani was infected with multiple, diverse Bartonella strains, and A. jamaicensis was infected with a strain related to a strain from a congeneric host. Ectoparasite load could possibly explain observed differences in Bartonella diversity and prevalence between bat species in this community, and we suggest future research to substantiate these preliminary findings.",

            "abstractNote": "Retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is a brain region involved in critical cognitive functions including memory, planning, and spatial navigation and is commonly affected in neurodegenerative diseases. Subregions of RSC are typically described as Brodmann areas 29 and 30, which are defined by cytoarchitectural features. Using immunofluorescence, we studied the distributions of neurons immunoreactive for NeuN, latexin, and calcium binding proteins (calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin) in RSC of Carollia perspicillata, Seba's short-tailed fruit bat. We observed that latexin was specifically present in areas 29a and 29b but not 29c and 30. We further identified distribution patterns of calcium binding proteins that group areas 29a and 29b separately from areas 29c and 30. We conclude first that latexin is a useful marker to classify subregions of RSC and second that these subregions contain distinct patterns of neuronal immunoreactivity for calcium binding proteins. Given the long lifespan of Carollia, bat RSC may be a useful model in studying age-related neurodegeneration.",

In addition, species of the family are often among the most common in neotropical forests, especially in the Amazon Basin. The Brazil nut family is diverse and abundant in the Amazon and is considered to be an indicator of undisturbed or scarcely disturbed lowland forests; thus, what is learned about its evolution, ecology, and biogeography may suggest similar patterns for other Amazonian tree families. We used combined data sets derived from the\n              ndhF\n              and\n              trnL‐F\n              genes to elucidate relationships of genera in both the Old and New Worlds that have been associated with Lecythidaceae. Our molecular tree agrees with the recognition of Napoleonaeaceae and Scytopetalaceae. Within the Lecythidaceae, there is molecular support for recognizing three subfamilies: Foetidioideae, Planchonioideae, and Lecythidoideae. We then focused on genera of the Lecythidoideae and found support for recognizing\n              Allantoma\n              (when the actinomorphic‐flowered species of\n              Cariniana\n              are included in it),\n              Grias, Gustavia\n              ,\n              Corythophora, Couratari\n              , and\n              Couroupita\n              , but conclude that\n              Cariniana\n              ,\n              Lecythis\n              , and\n              Eschweilera\n              are not monoyphyletic. Because the position of the monotypic\n              Bertholletia excelsa\n              in relation to the other zygomorphic‐flowered genera is not resolved, we are not able to comment on its generic relationships.",

            "abstractNote": "Despite the ecological importance of bats, a lack of basic data, such as spaceuse needs, hinders management efforts. Therefore, we investigated home-range size in Nycticeius humeralis (Evening Bats) by radiotracking 14 individuals (5 females and 9 males) for 7–11 nights each in a pine-dominated landscape in southwestern Georgia during June–August 2008. We generated 95% and 50% adaptive kernel (AK) home ranges and 95% minimum convex polygon (MCP) home ranges and found that mean 95% AK home-range size was 155.7 ± 38.3 ha, with individual values ranging from 36.9 ha to 565.9 ha. Mean 95% MCP home-range size was 118.5 ± 29.5 ha, with individual values ranging from 33.6–456.2 ha. Home-range sizes did not differ between males and females (P = 0.35), but were larger in August (P = 0.004) than in June and July. Evening Bat home-range sizes on our study area were similar to previously documented home ranges in forested and rural landscapes. Although Evening Bats may be habitat generalists relative to foraging activity at the scale of habitat patches, multiple core areas of activity indicate selection within this scale that may be related to prey and roost availability.",

This is especially true for the endangered Eumops floridanus (Florida bonneted bat). Scant knowledge of the species’ natural history and ecological interactions has precluded the development of effective conservation strategies. We investigated several aspects of the social organization of E. floridanus roosting in bat houses in southwest Florida: group size, group composition, group stability, and seasonality of reproduction. Our findings suggest the species has characteristics more common to tropical bat species than temperate ones. The average roost size was 10 individuals, with colonies in a harem social structure all three times in the year they were assessed. Adults were much more likely than sub-adults to be recaptured at the same roosts during subsequent capture sessions. We suggest that the availability and distribution of roosts may alter the social structure of these bats and ultimately limit local populations. We did not find evidence of a distinct seasonal birthing period matching that of other temperate bat species. Results suggests the species is aseasonally polyestrous, making non-volant E. floridanus vulnerable to disturbance across a larger portion of the year than other bat species in the US.",

It is endemic to Jamaica and formerly known only from Stony Hill Cave, where there are an estimated c.  individuals. Previously declared extinct twice, its rediscovery in  at Stony Hill Cave marked new hope for the conservation of this important species. Although little is known about its ecology, the species is presumed to be a cave-obligate rooster and to rely exclusively on so-called hot caves, which are defined by high ambient temperatures and low air quality. In March–April , we surveyed bats at seven caves throughout Jamaica. At two of these, Green Grotto Caves, St. Ann, and Rock Spring Caverns, St. Mary, we captured both male and pregnant female P. aphylla. At Green Grotto Caves, we captured  P. aphylla, and  at Rock Spring Caverns. We believe Rock Spring Caverns to be one of the largest known roosts of P. aphylla. Neither of these sites are hot caves as both are moderated by flowing water, although warmer chambers may be more important to this bat than to other species. Further monitoring of these populations and continued exploration of other potential roosts are vital for the protection of this species.",

Tumor types identiﬁed include ﬁbrosarcoma, cutaneous lymphoma, benign focal bronchioloalveolar neoplasm, anaplastic sarcoma, and sebaceous epithelioma. To the author’s knowledge, aside from a recent report of focal brochioloalveolar adenoma,8 these tumor types have not previously been described in the Rousettus species, nor in chiropterans in general. Based upon these ﬁndings and other recent publications regarding R. aegyptiacus, neoplasia does appear to be a signiﬁcant cause of morbidity and mortality in captive members of this megachiropterid species.",

Although fruit bats are potentially exposed to pesticides during their entire lifespan, the impacts of this exposure are still poorly investigated. We examined the effects of low, commercially recommended concentrations (0, 1.05 and 2.1 g/l) of an organochlorine insecticide endosulfan (EDS) formulation on oxidative responses in the liver and kidneys of Neotropical fruit bats (Artibeus lituratus), as well as possible liver morphological alterations following a 35-day oral exposure. Superoxide dismutase activity was signiﬁcantly decreased upon exposure to 1.05 g/l of EDS in the liver and kidneys, catalase was decreased in the liver of 2.1 g/l EDS-exposed bats, while glutathione Stransferase was increased in the liver of 2.1 g/l EDS-exposed bats. Protein carbonyls increased following the exposure to the highest EDS dose tested. Endosulfan-induced morphological alterations in the liver included cell degeneration and cell death, with apparent cytoplasm lipid accumulation (steatosis) and pyknotic nuclei, karyolysis and deposit of collagen ﬁbres. Our ﬁndings suggest that exposure to low concentrations of EDS induced a certain extent of oxidative damage in fruit bats, which may have led to liver morphological alterations.",

However, for individuals occupying spatially limited structures, such as tree cavities, group formation may inﬂuence—and be inﬂuenced by—the range of structures available for use. This may be especially true of bats, which often form maternity groups that regularly change in size. We examined colonies of tree-roosting little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus (LeConte, 1831)) in northern Alberta to address two questions: (1) is group size associated with patterns of roost use, in particular the use of large-diameter trees, and (2) does group size change during reproduction and correspond to changes in roost use? We located roosts over 2 years using radiotelemetry and conducted exit counts at a subset of these roosts. Larger diameter trees had larger and more variable group sizes. Roost-tree diameter peaked near the start of parturition, the time when bats formed the largest groups. We suggest that large groups are especially beneﬁcial at this time due to the thermoregulatory beneﬁts to small, unfurred pups. Our results indicate that roost use and group size are interrelated and that large-diameter trees may be especially beneﬁcial by supporting a wider range of group sizes.",

Historic distribution records of this species in the Pacific Northwest region of North America include southern Oregon and southern Idaho, but not British Columbia. During 2014–2016 we conducted bat acoustic surveys in Canada on Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, sampling 1342 detector-nights. We recorded multiple bat-call sequences during 2016 showing pulse and sequence attributes consistent with those of the Brazilian Free-tailed Bat, and we recorded 2 such call sequences in 2015. Calls were detected from May until September, suggesting summer residency by adults, rather than stray post-natal dispersals from the south. The Brazilian Free-tailed Bat is a fast long-distance flyer, and acoustic surveys outside of its historic range may benefit from surveillance for this species.",

NJ analysis shows polyphyly of Insectivora and Chiroptera. Assuming that each of Primates, Ferungulata, Chiroptera, Insectivora and Rodentia is a monophyletic group, ML analysis suggests that Chiroptera is a sister group of Insectivora and that Ferungulata is the closest outgroup to the (Insectivora and Chiroptera) clade.",

These include three uninterrupted (CA)n repeats, ranging in length from (CA)17 to (CA)19, one interrupted repeat (CA)4(CG)2(CA)13, and one uninterrupted (GA)27 repeat. All loci were highly polymorphic, with 17–20 alleles identified per locus. Observed heterozygosity levels (0.66–0.82) are lower than expected due to homozygote excess, probably caused by pooling of populations, resulting in population substructuring. All five polymorphic loci were also successfully amplified in the closely related M. fraterculus. Two pairs of primers additionally amplified polymorphic microsatellites in Chaerophon sp.",

            "abstractNote": "Summit metabolism (Msum), the maximum rate of resting metabolic thermogenesis, has been found to be broadly correlated with climatic variables and the use of heterothermy in some endotherms. Far less is known about Msum and metabolic expansibility [ME, the ratio of Msum to basal metabolic rate (BMR)] in bats compared with many other endotherm taxa. We measured BMR and Msum during winter and summer in captive and wild populations of a pteropodid from the southern subtropics, Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) in Pretoria, South Africa. The Msum of fruit bats ranged from 5.178±0.611 W (captive, summer) to 6.006±0.890 W (captive, winter), and did not vary significantly between seasons. In contrast, BMR decreased by 17–25% in winter. The combination of seasonally stable Msum but flexible BMR resulted in ME being significantly higher in winter than in summer, ranging from 7.24±1.49 (wild, summer) to 13.11±2.14 (captive, winter). The latter value is well above the typical mammalian range. Moreover, both Msum and ME were significantly higher in captive bats than in wild individuals; we speculate this represents a phenotypic response to a reduction in exerciseassociated heat production while in captivity. Our data for E. wahlbergi, combined with those currently available for other chiropterans, reveal that Msum in bats is highly variable compared with allometrically expected values for other mammals.",

Does this differ entiation arise purely from the use of distinct feeding habitats or, alternatively, do the species exert active prey selection within their feeding habitats? To answer this question, we compared the distribution of prey in the species’ diets with that in their respective feeding habitats, looking for discrepancies with respect to taxon and/or size. Although the general correlation is fairly good, some local discrepancies arise: (1) M. myotis underexploited small prey items (&lt;0.05 g dry weight), and (2) M. blythii overexploited cockchafers (Melolontha melolontha) and underexploited ground arthropods. We argue, however, that these discrepancies do not result from active prey selection, but from (1) the low availability of some categories of prey (due to either low detectability or low accessibility) and (2) the opportunistic exploitation of atypical feeding habitats. In fact, our results do not falsify the parsimonious hypothesis that the two species exert no active prey selection within their feeding habitats. We are furthermore not aware of any paper from the bat literature that provides definite support for active prey selection among insectivorous vespertilionids. Their echolocation system may actually preclude it.",

            "abstractNote": "Breeding of the threatened long-tailed bat Chalinolobus tuberculatus was studied over seven summers, 1993±2000, in temperate rainforest, Fiordland, New Zealand. Reproductive history of 789 marked bats from three social groups was investigated. Seventy per cent of births occurred over a 10-day period in midDecember. Young began ¯ying at 5±6 weeks and nipples of reproductive females were regressing 2 weeks later. Sex ratio at birth was equal. Lactation coincided with highest annual air temperatures and peak abundance of ¯ying invertebrates. Date of ®rst birth varied by 4 days annually, but date of ®rst ¯ight varied by 17 days. Males had distended cauda epididymides at 1 year old (mean  se = 1.63  0.16 years) and epididymal distension peaked in early autumn. Females ®rst gave birth at 2±3 years of age (2.33  0.08 years). The short, highly synchronous breeding season, birth of single young, early mating in autumn, and late age of female sexual maturity compared to similar-sized vespertilionids, may be related to low food availability and unpredictable cold-temperate weather conditions. Annual productivity did not differ among groups but probability of survival of juveniles varied from 0.26 to 0.88 and was inversely proportional to size of natal group. Variability in breeding parameters was unrelated to climate or body condition of bats. The group with highest survival rates contained reproductive females and juveniles with signi®cantly higher body condition. Differences in roost site or food quality within the home range of each group, varying genetic quality of members of the groups, or density-dependent mechanisms, may explain differential survival, but these hypotheses require investigation. A population crash and poor productivity in 1996 coincided with an irruption in the numbers of stoats Mustela erminea implying that predation by introduced animals can cause periodic population crashes. These results should be used to examine implications of these hypotheses on the long-term viability of Chalinolobus populations.",

Detector units recorded the number of bats passing per hour as an index of activity. Habitat use patterns were compared with longtailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) sampled concurrently. Activity levels in lesser short-tailed bats varied significantly among five habitat types and amongst hours of the night. Of the total activity recorded, most passes (82.6% of n = 657 bat passes) were in red beech forest >200 m from the forest edge; 13.7% were in silver beech within 100 m of forest edges, 2.6% were along roads through forest, 0.9% were on the forest-grassland edge, and 0.2% were in the open grassland. Lesser short-tailed bats were active throughout the night but especially at dawn and dusk. There was no correlation between levels of activity by lesser short-tailed bats and overnight minimum or dusk temperatures. Patterns of habitat use and activity in long-tailed bats were significantly different from those of lesser short-tailed bats.",

We investigated male attendance at big brown bat maternity roosts in a Colorado study area that shows a pattern of sexual segregation by elevation. We tested multiple predictions of three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses to explain male attendance patterns: 1) sex-specific differences in energetic strategies of males and females are maintained at the lower elevation; 2) natal philopatry of inexperienced young males accounts for most attendants; 3) males gain a reproductive advantage for late summer mating at maternity roosts. We tested predictions based on captures of bats at emergence, automated monitoring of annual, seasonal, and daily roost attendance by known-age bats tagged with passive integrated transponders, and anatomical evidence for mating. Findings were most consistent with the first two hypotheses. Adult males accounted for just 3.1% of 8,192 captures of bats at 285 evening emergences from 46 roosts during 2001–2005. Daily attendance rates of males during each active season (0.10 detections/day at age 1 year and 0.20 detections/day at ≥ 2 years old) were lower than in females (0.34 at age 1 year and 0.45 at ≥ 2 years old). Only 92 of 299 males tagged as volant juveniles were detected as adults at five maternity roosts monitored 2002–2005, far fewer than female returns in every age category. We detected known-age adult males almost exclusively at their natal roosts and most males that returned (91 of 92) in years after tagging as juveniles were first detected as 1-year-olds; 20 of 21 individuals that returned at 2–4 years of age were previously detected as 1-year-olds. One-year-old males were re-encountered at annual rates 5–16 times higher than 2- to 4-year-old males, and 1-year-old males and females had lower daily attendance rates than older bats. The male reproductive advantage hypothesis was not well supported. None of 80 females examined in late summer had evidence of insemination, and not all males showed distended scrota. Daily attendance rates of tagged adult males (n = 155) and females (n = 788) were lowest during late summer, suggesting that little reproductive advantage was accrued by males utilizing maternity roosts. Attendance of male big brown bats at maternity roosts at our study area is consistent with the sex-specific energetic strategies and natal philopatry hypotheses, and mating probably occurs at higher elevation autumn roosts and hibernacula.",

Of these, one isolate was resistant to chlortetracycline and streptomycin, and nine were resistant to sulfadimethoxine (SDMX). Half of these (n = 5) resistant isolates had the transmissible R plasmid for antimicrobials suggesting that OLHB is a species that hardly harbors antimicrobial‐resistant\n              Enterobacteriaceae.\n              One possible reason for this low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is that the bat lives in a clean environment with no or only very low artificial drug contaminations due to low contact with such as livestock that frequently carries antibiotic‐resistant bacteria. This study suggests that it's important to monitor antimicrobial resistance of\n              Enterobacteriaceae\n              in OLHB as a model for natural R plasmid transfer in a natural environment without specific pathological bacteria and artificial drugs.",

            "abstractNote": "Trypanosoma rangeli is a nonpathogenic parasite for humans; however, its medical importance relies in its similarity and overlapping distribution with Trypanosoma cruzi, causal agent of Chagas disease in the Americas. The genetic diversity of T. rangeli and its association with host species (triatomines and mammals) has been identiﬁed along Central and the South America; however, it has not included data of isolates from Ecuador. This study reports infection with T. rangeli in 18 genera of mammal hosts and ﬁve species of triatomines in three environments (domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic). Higher infection rates were found in the sylvatic environment, in close association with Rhodnius ecuadoriensis. The results of this study extend the range of hosts infected with this parasite and the geographic range of the T. rangeli genotype KP1(-)/lineage C in South America. It was not possible to detect variation on T. rangeli from the central coastal region and southern Ecuador with the analysis of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) gene, even though these areas are ecologically different and a phenotypic subdivision of R. ecuadoriensis has been found. R. ecuadoriensis is considered one of the most important vectors for Chagas disease transmission in Ecuador due to its wide distribution and adaptability to diverse environments. An extensive knowledge of the trypanosomes circulating in this species of triatomine, and associated mammal hosts, is important for delineating transmission dynamics and preventive measures in the endemic areas of Ecuador and Northern Peru.",

This tick is found throughout the northeastern, coastal southeastern, and upper midwestern United States and is considered the most significant vector of tick-borne pathogens to humans in North America. Despite its ubiquity and broad host range, I. scapularis previously has not been reported feeding on bats (Chiroptera). However, during 2019 and 2020, larvae and nymphs of I. scapularis were recovered from big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus (Palisot de Beauvois), at four locations in rural NewYork State, USA. All Ixodes infested bats were injured and found on the ground; therefore, parasitism by I. scapularis was likely opportunistic. Nonetheless, the large number of pathogens known to be associated with bats and the frequency with which I. scapularis bites people suggest that this host–tick relationship is of at least potential epidemiological significance.",

            "abstractNote": "In recent years, there has been an increasing risk of hematophagous bat attacks in Latin America, where livestock production is a basic source of food for local populations. In Ecuador, livestock represented an important part of agricultural output. Some cases of cattle bitten by bats in the province of Santa Elena have been reported; however, no previous studies have been conducted to determine the magnitude of the attacks and the associated risk factors. In this research, a cross-sectional descriptive study was performed recording attacks of hematophagous bats (Desmodus rotundus) through visual inspection of livestock and the capture of specimens by mist nets. Generally, the prevalence of D. rotundus attacks on farms was 69%, whereas attacks on bovine had 24% of prevalence. From the captured specimens, 93% were identiﬁed as D. rotundus and within the 30% of the captured D. rotundus, no infections for rabies virus were diagnosed. The univariable analysis used for estimating the risk factors associated with bat attacks showed that corrals away from populated centers present the highest risk (odds ratio [OR] = 19.864; p = 0.0004), followed by tree density >30 per hectare (OR = 16.313; p < 0.0001) and predatory birds of bats (OR = 15.375; p < 0.0001); a binary logistic regression model showed ‘‘corrals away from populated centers’’ (OR = 23.47; p = 0.006) as the main risk factor. Linear regression analysis showed good correlation between the number of bovines attacked and the number of bites (R2 = 0.977; p < 0.0001) suggesting some feeding patterns of D. rotundus. This study could be used as a starting point for understanding the feeding habits of D. rotundus and factors governing their attacks in coastal regions of Ecuador, and potential occurrences of rabies infections. With this knowledge, surveillance and control programs can be supported to improve rabies transmission monitoring.",

            "abstractNote": "The claustrum is a gray‐matter structure that underlies neocortex and reciprocates connections with cortical and subcortical targets. In lower mammals, the claustrum is directly adjacent to neocortex, making the definition of claustral boundaries challenging. Latexin, an endogenous inhibitor of metallocarboxypeptidases, localizes to claustral cells, enabling a clear delineation of claustrum. Given its proportionately large claustrum, we hypothesized that the short‐tailed fruit bat,\n              Carollia perspicillata,\n              can be a useful model for claustral structure–function relations. We used latexin immunohistochemistry to identify claustral boundaries and intrinsic structure and multielectrode recordings from brain slices to explore intrinsic excitatory connectivity of the claustrum.\n            \n            \n              Carollia's\n              claustrum contains cells whose intrinsic connectivity and alignment permit the generation of spontaneous, synchronous population events and mirror their pattern of spread in disinhibited brain slices over millimeters.\n              Carollia\n              shows cellular alignment and spontaneous population‐activity spread along both horizontal and dorsoventral axes.\n              Carollia\n              claustrum possesses intrinsic excitatory connectivity sufficient to: 1) generate single, spontaneous, synchronized burst discharges, 2) support activity spread along axes where claustral cells are aligned, and 3), because of multiple axes for cell alignment, support activity spread along both rostrocaudal and dorsoventral axes. The smaller event sizes in bat claustrum compared with rat claustrum are consistent with events occurring in population subsets rather than the full claustral cell population. The overall size of claustrum, its pronounced vascularity, and its more complex intrinsic connectivity than rat suggest that the bat is an animal model for claustral structure and function that will permit unique access to claustrum's processing capabilities.

In order to study behaviour and to examine patterns of paternity and relatedness between different harem groups, we developed 14 microsatellite loci from two different enriched genomic libraries. We screened 125 individuals from two different bat colonies and found that polymorphism ranged from five to 13 alleles. Heterozygosity ranged from 63 to 95%. The primers amplified across 14 bat species, indicating their potential utility for population-level studies in several closely related bat species.",

We studied harems of 4–20 females associated with a dominant male in small groups of Artibeus jamaicensis (,14 females), and with dominant and subordinate males in large groups (.14 females). Dominant males displayed defensive behavior toward satellite males when they intruded into the roosting site. Small groups received the highest number of visits by satellite males, and dominant males did not display total defense of females. During the breeding season, females roosted in highly compacted clusters and dominant males were more active in their defensive behavior. Subordinate males were generally tolerated in harem groups and their presence reduced the number of adult male visits. Some young in large harem groups were sired by subordinate males, resulting in a genetic beneﬁt for both dominant and subordinate males. Dominant males had the highest ﬁtness in the large harem groups by sharing paternity with related subordinate males and by rejecting unrelated intruders.",

A total of 84 adults captured in two caves exhibited little genetic differentiation between caves (FST = 0.008). Average relatedness among adult females in 10 harem groups was very low (R = 0.014 ± 0.011), providing no evidence of harem structure. Dominant and subordinate males shared paternity in large groups, while dominant and satellite males shared paternity in smaller groups. However, our results suggest that male rank influences paternity. Dominant males fathered 69% of 40 offspring, followed by satellite (22%) and subordinate males (9%). Overall adult male bats are not closely related, however, in large harem groups we found that subordinate and dominant males exhibited relatedness values consistent with a father-offspring relationship. Because dominant and subordinate males also sired all the pups in large groups, we propose that their association provides inclusive fitness to them.",

The endemic ﬁsh-eating myotis (Myotis vivesi) is restricted to a few insular ecosystems in the Gulf of California, where it feeds on both marine and terrestrial prey; yet it is unknown whether its diet covaries with marine primary productivity. We determined the relative contribution of marine and terrestrial food sources to the diet of the ﬁsh-eating myotis to test the hypothesis that seasonal changes in oceanic primary productivity would dictate general feeding patterns of this bat species. We predicted that marine food would predominate in the diet of the bat during winter followed by an increase in importance of terrestrial food sources as summer approached. We measured amount of feces deposited in the day roost per bat and extrapolated this value to estimate amount of feces deposited in 1 year by the ﬁsh-eating myotis population in Partida Norte Island. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of bat blood and examination of food remains in feces showed that marine food was the main source of nutrients for ﬁsh-eating myotis throughout the year. Importance of terrestrial food was marginal during most of the year, with a modest increase in summer. Estimated annual feces production was up to 1,518 kg. Because of its predominantly marine feeding habits, ﬁsheating myotis transfer allochthonous nutrients to islands where they roost, subsidizing the nutrient and energy economy of the islands.",

Litomosoides molossi Esslinger, 1973 was recovered from the thoracic and abdominal cavities of Molossus molossus (prevalence [P] ¼ 6.4%); Litomosoides chandleri Esslinger, 1973 from Artibeus planirostris (P ¼ 6.9%), Sturnira oporaphilum (P ¼ 66.6%), Sturnira erythromos (P ¼ 23.8%), Sturnira lilium (P ¼ 7.2%), and Eumops perotis (P ¼ 50%); and Litomosoides saltensis n. sp. was collected from Eptesicus furinalis (P ¼ 1.7%). In this paper, we emend the description of L. molossi; describe a new species, Litomosoides saltensis n. sp., on the basis of 1 female specimen; and report for the ﬁrst time L. molossi and L. chandleri parasitizing Argentinean bats, expanding the host and locality records. Litomosoides molossi exhibits a slender buccal capsule, with an anterior segment transparent, and the posterior chitinous portion displays 2 thickenings in the ﬁrst third; possesses 1 dorsal prominent cephalic papilla and 4 labial papillae distributed around the mouth; cuticle with lateral punctuations all along the hypodermic chords in both sexes; and male with area rugosa and tail without cloacal papillae. In L. chandleri, the lateral punctuations are distributed on the posterior extremity of the body in both sexes. Litomosoides saltensis n. sp. displays a thick buccal capsule with a posterior segment well cuticularized, possessing 2 thickenings in the anterior half; 4 labial and 2 ventral cephalic papillae; a globular vulva located anterior to the esophagus–intestine junction; cuticle with lateral punctuations in the posterior extremity of the body; and tail with salient phasmids. We also provide a taxonomic key for the identiﬁcation of the Litomosoides sp. of bat dwelling. Long-term studies and large sample sizes are needed to detect the presence of Litomosoides sp. in bats, in contrast to the ﬁndings in cricetid rodents, which seem to be more frequently collected.",

Based on a combined sample of 834 specimens, by means of the point at which genotype frequencies equal 20% and 80% (20/80 rule), we estimated that 3 chromosomal morphs (designated Aa, Bb, and Cc) had an average clinal width of 33.3 km. The widest cline, Bb, was 12.53 km wider than the narrowest, Cc. Morph Cc was detected at 2 localities, 72 and 80 km northwest of the nearest locality from which it was previously known. Overall, we detected little change in clinal architecture during the intervening years between these 2 analyses. Four investigators who used the same data set have published 4 different interpretations of clinal dynamics. These interpretations are mutually contradictory and so all cannot be correct.",

The Pendlebury’s roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pendleburyi, is endemic to Thailand and listed as a vulnerable species. We employed the 10Â Genomics linked-read technology to obtain a genome assembly of H. pendleburyi. The assembly size was 2.17 Gb with a scaffold N50 length of 15,398,518 bases. Our phylogenetic analysis placed H. pendleburyi within the rhinolophoid clade of the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. A synteny analysis showed that H. pendleburyi shared conserved chromosome segments (up to 105 Mb) with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Phyllostomus discolor albeit having different chromosome numbers and belonging different families. We found positive selection signals in genes involved in inflammation, spermatogenesis and Wnt signalling. The analyses of transposable elements suggested the contraction of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and the accumulation of young mariner DNA transposons in the analysed hipposiderids. Distinct mariners were likely horizontally transferred to hipposiderid genomes over the evolution of this family. The lineage-specific profiles of SINEs and mariners might involve in the evolution of hipposiderids and be associated with the phylogenetic separations of these bats from other bat families.",

However, the diversification of echolocation call structure in bats allows for considerable morphological similarity while still permitting niche differentiation based on specialisation for prey type and habitat structure. The recent separation of a common Palaearctic bat, the pipistrelle, into\n              Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n              and\n              P. pygmaeus,\n              which are sympatrically distributed throughout their range, raises the question as to whether these two morphologically similar species partition resources in time and space.\n            \n            \n              To test the hypothesis that the coexistence of these cryptic species is facilitated by differential habitat use, 14\n              P\n              .\n              pipistrellus\n              , and 12\n              P. pygmaeus\n              were radio‐tracked from adjacent maternity roosts, in northeast Scotland, from May to September 2002/2003. The two species showed distinct habitat partitioning with\n              P. pygmaeus\n              foraging predominantly in riparian woodland and over water, and\n              P. pipistrellus\n              foraging along woodland edges and short isolated tree lines. Inter‐specific overlap in habitat use was low and consequently foraging ranges were segregated spatially.\n            \n            The degree of habitat partitioning revealed in these species, which show considerable overlap in echolocation call parameters and functional morphology, suggests that morphological features, whilst useful in separating chiropteran species into coarse‐grained foraging guilds, may not predict fine‐grained ecological segregation.",

We surveyed three mule deer herds across the state of Nevada for infection with relapsing fever Borrelia spp. spirochetes. Bacterial prevalence varied by the county where deer were sampled but Borrelia spirochetes were detected in 7.7% of all deer sampled. Infected deer were identiﬁed in every location from which mule deer samples were obtained. Sequencing of the Borrelia intergenic spacer gene (IGS) revealed that one individual was infected with Borrelia coriaceae and all others were infected with Borrelia hermsii. The vector of B. hermsii, Ornithodoros hermsi (Acari: Argasidae, Wheeler, Herms, and Meyer, 1935), feeds primarily on wild rodents and has not been identiﬁed infesting deer. Additionally, Ornithodoros coriaceus (Acari: Argasidae, Koch, 1844), which readily feeds on deer and is frequently infected with B. coriaceae, has not been shown to be a competent vector for B. hermsii. Our data represent the ﬁrst sylvatic evidence of B. hermsii infection in mule deer. Additionally, our data provide evidence that infection with relapsing fever spirochetes in Nevada is wide ranging in the state’s deer populations.",

However, important information on their behaviour and movement ecology, such as the locations and altitudes at which they forage, is still fragmentary, while crucial for their conservation in light of the increasing threat posed by progressing WT construction. We adopted two different methods of microphone array recordings and GPS-tracking capturing data from different spatio-temporal scales in order to gain a complementary understanding of the echolocation and movement ecology of\n              Nyctalus aviator\n              , the largest open-space bat in Japan. Based on microphone array recordings, we found that echolocation calls during natural foraging are adapted for fast flight in open-space optimal for aerial-hawking. In addition, we attached a GPS tag that can simultaneously monitor feeding buzz occurrence, and confirmed that foraging occurred at 300 m altitude and that the flight altitude in mountainous areas is consistent with the turbine conflict zone, suggesting that the birdlike noctule is a high-risk species in Japan. Further investigations on this species could provide valuable insights into their foraging and movement ecology, facilitating the development of a risk assessment regarding WTs.",

Bioactive lipid mediators (oxylipins) formed by enzymatic oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids can contribute to these immune responses, but have not been investigated in WNS pathophysiology. Nonenzymatic conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids can also occur due to reactive oxygen species, however, these enantiomeric isomers will lack the same signaling properties. In this study, we performed a series of targeted lipidomic approaches on laboratory Pseudogymnoascus destructans-inoculated bats to assess changes in their splenic lipidome, including the formation of lipid mediators at early stages of WNS. Hepatic lipids previously identified were also resolved to a higher structural detail. We compared WNS-susceptible M. lucifugus to a WNS-resistant species, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). Altered splenic lipid levels were only observed in M. lucifugus. Differences in splenic free fatty acids included both omega-3 and omega-6 compounds. Increased levels of an enantiomeric monohydroxy DHA mixture were found, suggesting nonenzymatic formation. Changes in previously identified hepatic lipids were confined to omega-3 constituents. Together, these results suggest that increased oxidative stress, but not an inflammatory response, is occurring in bats at early stages of WNS that precedes fat depletion. These data have been submitted to metabolomics workbench and assigned a study number ST002304.",

            "abstractNote": "White nose syndrome (WNS) is a cutaneous fungal disease of bats. WNS is responsible for unprecedented mortalities in North American cave bat populations. There have been few descriptions of enzyme activities that may function in WNS host/pathogen interactions, while no study has isolated and described secreted proteases. To address the hypothesis that Pseudogymnoascus destructans secretes extracellular proteases that function in wing necrosis during WNS infection, the object of this study was to culture P. destructans on various media, then isolate and structurally identify those proteases accumulated stably in the culture medium. We found a single dominant protease activity on minimal nutrient broth enriched with protein substrates, which was strongly inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This P. destructans serine protease (PdSP1) was isolated by preparative isoelectric focusing and concanavalin A lectin affinity chromatography. PdSP1 showed a molecular weight 27,900 (estimated by SDS-PAGE), broad pH optimum 6-8, and temperature optimum 60°C. Structural characterization of PdSP1 by MALDI-TOF MS, Orbitrap MS/MS, and Edman amino-terminal peptide sequencing matched it directly to a hypothetical protein accession from the sequenced P. destructans genome that is further identified as a MEROPS family S8A subtilisin-like serine peptidase. Two additional isoforms, PdSP2 and PdSP3, were identified in the P. destructans genome with 90% and 53% homology, respectively. P. destructans S8A serine proteases showed closer sequence conservation to P. pannorum and plant pathogenic fungi than to human pathogenic dermatophytes. Peptide-specific polyclonal antibodies developed from the PdSP1 sequence detected the protein in western blots. These subtilisin-like serine proteases are candidates for further functional studies in WNS host-pathogen interaction.",

            "abstractNote": "Levels of nucleotide polymorphism in three paralogous Drosophila simulans genes, janusA ( janA), janusB ( janB), and ocnus (ocn), were surveyed by DNA sequencing. The three genes lie in tandem within a 2.5-kb region of chromosome arm 3R. In a sample of eight alleles from a worldwide distribution we found a signiﬁcant departure from neutrality by several statistical tests. The most striking feature of this sample was that in a 1.7-kb region containing the janA and janB genes, 30 out of 31 segregating sites contained variants present only once in the sample, and 29 of these unique variants were found in the same allele. A restriction survey of an additional 28 lines of D. simulans revealed strong linkage disequilibrium over the janA-janB region and identiﬁed six more alleles matching the rare haplotype. Among the rare alleles, the level of DNA sequence variation was typical for D. simulans autosomal genes and showed no departure from neutrality. In addition, the rare haplotype was more similar to the D. melanogaster sequence, indicating that it was the ancestral form. These results suggest that the derived haplotype has risen to high worldwide frequency relatively recently, most likely as a result of natural selection.",
