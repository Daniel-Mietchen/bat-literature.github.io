            "abstractNote": "Natural selection should favor individuals that synchronize energy-demanding aspects of reproductive activity with periods of high resource abundance and predictability, leading to seasonal patterns of reproduction at the population level. Nonetheless, few studies—especially those on bats in the Neotropics—have used rigorous quantitative criteria to distinguish among phenological patterns for different populations from the same habitat or for the same species in different habitats. To explore such issues, we quantified annual patterns of reproduction in male and in female bats from lowland Amazonia (environs of Iquitos, Peru), and did so at the level of populations and ensembles. Five species exhibited unimodal patterns including Artibeus obscurus, A. planirostris, Carollia benkeithi, Phyllostomus hastatus, and Rhinophylla pumilio. Two species (A. lituratus and Glossophaga soricina) evinced bimodal patterns with reproductive peaks separated by patterns of inactivity, whereas four species (C. brevicauda, C. perspicillata, Sturnira lilium, and S. tildae) evinced a bimodal pattern in which peaks in activity occur in tandem, with the first peak generally markedly higher than the second peak. Frugivore, gleaning animalivore, and nectarivore ensembles exhibited bimodal, unimodal, and bimodal reproductive phenologies, respectively. Nonetheless, interannual variation in phenology (i.e., the monthly timing of peaks within a season rather than the number of peaks per year) characterized four (A. obscurus, C. brevicauda, C. perspicillata, and S. lilium) of the eight species and each of the three ensembles (frugivores, gleaning animalivores, and nectarivores) with adequate sampling. Regardless of interspecific variation in strategies, the phenology of reproduction enhances the likelihood that parturition and recruitment of young into the population occurs during the wet season, the period of likely highest resource abundance. Based on a comparison of our results with those from other well-studied bat populations, four species did not exhibit geographic variation in reproductive phenologies (A. obscurus, G. soricina, C. brevicauda, and R. pumilio), whereas three species evinced such geographic variation (A. lituratus, A. planirostris, and C. perspicillata). Climate change will likely alter the seasons and extents of propitious times for reproductive activities, as well as the reliability of proximate cues for initiating reproduction, compromising current reproductive strategies and leading to altered phenological patterns of reproduction or reproductive success, possibly resulting in local extinction of some species.",

Despite conservation and habitat management implications, the effects of land-use change on the trophic relationships between nocturnal arthropod predators and their prey have seldom been described. To assess how arthropodivorous bats may have shifted their diets in response to land-use changes, we compared bulk δ 13C and δ 15N values from little brown and big brown bat museum specimens and carcasses collected in the Upper Midwestern region of the United States from 1898 to 2019. As an exploratory analysis, we also investigated relationships between isotopic values and climate or landcover variables to quantify potential correlations with changes in arthropodivorous bat foraging patterns over time. Overall, we found that isotopic niche overlap of little brown and big brown bats increased from 24% to 45% between historical and contemporary time periods. Our results indicate that the isotopic niches of little brown bats have been largely conserved, whereas the isotopic niches of big brown bats are more flexible and became more similar to little brown bats over time. Further analyses showed that stable isotope values from arthropodivorous bat tissues were also correlated with certain landcover variables such as the prevalence of wetland, forest, and grassland habitats, but not with the prevalence of agricultural land on a local scale. These findings suggest that the foraging patterns of some aerial arthropodivores have shifted in response to the loss of habitat diversity and corresponding changes in prey resources.",

Since the first cases were recorded, WNS has spread rapidly across North America and is now confirmed or suspected in 40 US states and seven Canadian provinces. Often, the presence of P. destructans is detected in a cave or hibernaculum before signs of WNS manifest in the resident bat population, making presence of the fungus a more reliable assessment of potential epidemic spread than expansion of manifested WNS. An analysis of 43 cave internal climates across the state of Texas revealed a pattern of thermal suitability for P. destructans that correlated significantly with landscape (elevation, lithology) and external climate (mean surface temperature and precipitation). We generated a predictive model to assess the potential spread of P. destructans through Texas karst systems based on external features that correlate with suitable internal climates for fungal growth. Applications of this model to external climatic variables from 2019 showed seasonally varying patterns of suitability for fungal growth in select regions of Texas karst systems. Results from these surveys and models showed that internal climates of Texas caves are likely able to sustain the growth of P. destructans and could cause disease and resulting declines in Texas bats, and act as stepping-stones for the fungus, allowing it to travel southward into Mexican and Central American cave systems. The resulting work will inform researchers and natural resource managers of areas of significant concern to monitor for the spread of WNS.",

However, much of the region lacks baseline estimates of abundance for bats believed to be susceptible to WNS due to a scarcity of known hibernacula, where populations are traditionally monitored. The goal of this study was to determine the abundance, roost fidelity, and activity patterns of summer colonies of female little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) in an area with no known hibernacula. To accomplish this, we subcutaneously implanted passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags into 297 female little brown myotis from 2015 to 2018 and installed radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and antennas inside three maternity roosts in Yellowstone National Park. Bats occupied RFID-monitored roosts on 32% of days and were never detected at maternity roosts located &gt; 16 km from where they were tagged. Roost fidelity varied throughout summer and was greatest during late gestation and early lactation. This allowed us to combine nightly scans of RFID-tagged bats with visual emergence counts to estimate the population of bats using two roosts located &gt;16 km apart during 2017–2018. Population estimates of both colonies were markedly higher (N* = 208 ± 6 bats and N* = 836 ± 67 bats during 2018) than the number of bats seen during evening emergence (high counts of 127 and 222, respectively). Nocturnal visits of tagged bats to these roosts increased around the time of parturition, indicative of bats returning to nurse young. These data show that emergence count and PIT tag data can be combined to monitor bat population abundance and activity patterns in areas where hibernacula are absent or where their locations are unknown.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Animal-dispersed plants usually rely upon multiple dispersers. In many ecosystems, most of these interactions have yet to be explored; thus, documenting the extent of contribution of each animal partner to the reproduction and survival of plant species is key to understanding the ecology and evolution of animal–plant mutualism, as well as the potential responses of the ecological networks to biodiversity loss through defaunation. Here, by characterizing the outcomes and differences of the epizoochoric seed dispersal carried out by two species of frugivorous bats (Artibeus phaeotis and Uroderma convexum) in a Neotropical forest, we tested the prediction that, through their feeding activity, both bat species disperse and influence the subsequent seedling survival of multiple seed species. By direct sampling on bats’ dispersing sites and surrounding areas, we found evidence of the dispersal of 2,310 seeds of eight plant species, of which 118 survived to become seedlings. The total density of seeds and the seedling survival were significantly higher in areas directly influenced by the bats (i.e., feeding roosts) than in peripheral areas. Positive density-dependent effects nevertheless were detected in both sampling areas (feeding roosts and peripheral areas). Interspecific comparisons showed that despite both bat species having similar dispersal outcomes, seedlings in peripheral areas related to A. phaeotis have better survival rates. Our results demonstrate that both bat species primarily disperse by epizoochoric means seeds of various tree species at several localities in the study site. This result, together with the positive density-dependent effects, suggests that bats are moving seeds away from maternal trees and depositing them in locations where some of the seeds can germinate, establish, and survive, thereby highlighting the positive contribution of these bat species to the reproductive success of trees inhabiting Neotropical habitats. Our results contribute to the growing knowledge of frugivorous interactions on hyperdiverse forests and the role of small vertebrates on seed dispersal mutualisms.",

Some bat species reduce their activity levels during brighter nights, a phenomenon known as “lunar phobia.” While lunar phobia of bats has been extensively studied in tropical regions, the same is not the case of bats in temperate regions. By using acoustic detectors, we examined differences in the activity of insectivorous bats on nights with different moonlight intensity in an agricultural landscape of central Chile. We also examined the hourly activity patterns throughout the night and how these varied between full and new moon nights. All bat species modified their activity based on the moonlight intensity; however, their effects were species-specific. The activity of Lasiurus varius, L. villosissimus, Myotis chiloensis, and Histiotus montanus was lower during bright nights, while Tadarida brasiliensis was the only species whose activity was higher during bright nights. Hourly activity throughout the night differed between full moon nights and new moon nights in most bat species. During full moon, bats concentrated their activities in the early hours of the nights; a more homogeneous activity pattern was exhibited during new moon night. Our study demonstrates that moonlight affects the activity of bats in Chile, a factor that should be considered when studying bats.",

Current records of the species from about 10 localities suggest that M. lavali seems to occur throughout the South American dry corridor, with peripheral records in the Atlantic Forest. Based on new distribution records, we assess if M. lavali is endemic to the South American dry diagonal corridor through species distribution modeling using an ensemble approach. We obtained 35 occurrences for the species and built a consensus scenario based on 12 algorithms to model its distribution. Even using different thresholds to assign presence and absence of M. lavali, 95–99% of its predicted distribution is within the dry corridor, with few areas in the boundary of the Atlantic Forest, especially in deciduous forests. Therefore, our results support that M. lavali is indeed very likely restricted to the dry diagonal and, although it occupies forested areas, the core of its distribution lies in the Caatinga and in the Cerrado regions of Brazil.",

We established search plots of 100-m radius at eight randomly selected turbines (of 255) and searched the roads and pads at an additional 92 turbines. We conducted weekly searches from spring through fall and bimonthly during winter. We used GenEst (Generalized Mortality Estimator) to estimate bat fatalities corrected for searcher efficiency, carcass removal, and density-weighted proportion of area searched. We found 205 bats during standardized searches, the majority of which were Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis, 76%). The corrected fatality estimates were 16 bats/megawatt/year (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12 – 30 bats/megawatt/year) across all species. Species composition at our site is similar to that of northern Mexico, an area of expanding wind energy development with no published studies.",

            "abstractNote": "Vertebrate mating systems are inﬂuenced by ecological and phylogenetic factors, and the variation observed in mating behavior is frequently attributable to the extent to which male assistance in the rearing of offspring increases a female’s reproductive rate, size and stability of female groups, and density and distribution of females in space. In this study we evaluate patterns of association and parentage to describe the mating system of the tentmaking bat Artibeus watsoni. During 16 consecutive months, we regularly surveyed 2 sites in southwestern Costa Rica and determined size, composition, and stability of social groups, and established patterns of parentage within roosts. We found female-biased, mixed-sex social groups formed by individuals located in several roosts within an area. Roosting associations were low (average across all sites: 31%), and the frequent changes between roosting partners suggests that males and females formed nonexclusive mating bonds, which was further supported by our ﬁnding that only 27% of young were sired by the male within a roosting group. Paternal sibships were only observed in 17% of dyads of young roosting together, indicating that few males copulated with .1 female of the roosting group during the mating season. However, paternal sibships were only observed in Golﬁto, which could be explained by greater group size and stability attributable to lower roost availability. Thus, our ﬁndings are consistent with a polygynandrous mating system (2 or several males sharing access to 2 or several females, and vice versa) in which males associated intermittently with females that frequently switched roosts, and where breeding opportunities for males seemed related to the defense of roosts, roosting territories, or both.",

We radiotracked 42 individuals at 2 sites in the Golﬁto Wildlife Refuge and 6 sites at Corcovado National Park, southwestern Costa Rica. Average home-range size of A. watsoni was the smallest recorded for a bat species (3.6 ha). Site, age, reproductive status, habitat, and season all had signiﬁcant effects on foraging ranges, but sex and population abundance did not. Bats from the most productive sites, such as primary forests, had smaller foraging ranges, and subadults ranged farther than adults. During the dry season, females in late pregnancy had the smallest foraging ranges of all, most likely as a result of ﬂight constraints imposed by the large fetus and an increase in fruit availability. Conversely, lactating females sampled during the early rainy season had among the largest foraging ranges. Males had signiﬁcantly smaller roosting ranges than females, and adult bats sampled from areas of low roost abundance and high population abundance had smaller roosting ranges. However, subadults appeared to be unaffected by such changes in resource abundance, perhaps because they often roost in unmodiﬁed leaves. Although differences in resource availability and competition were important in determining roosting-range size, these effects were concealed by effects of reproductive activities such as mating, pregnancy, and lactation. Reproductive condition, along with foraging and roosting resource abundance, were largely responsible for determining ranging patterns in A. watsoni, but factors inﬂuenced foraging- and roosting-range size in different ways.",

We quantified size at birth and postnatal growth in free-ranging Phyllostomus hastatus (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) to develop age-predictive equations and examine effects of maternal size and age on size at birth and survivorship of young. There was a positive relationship between body mass of mothers and young; however, we found no relationship between maternal length of forearm or age on size of young at birth or survivorship. Males weighed more than females at birth and gained mass at a faster rate, although we found no significant gender differences at birth in length of forearm or length of total epiphyseal gap. High variation in size at birth and maturity suggests that there may be few environmental or life-history constraints on body size anc postnatal growth in P. hastatus.",

Length of forearm and body mass of 1day-old neonates averaged 43.3 mm Ϯ 2.7 SD and 15.9 g Ϯ 3.3 SD, respectively. Increase in forearm length and body mass was fastest in the 1st week after birth, but rate of increase decreased thereafter. Length of total epiphyseal gap increased to its maximum size at about 10 days after birth and subsequently decreased linearly. Growth constants derived from the logistic growth model were 0.096 and 0.114 for the increase in length of forearm and body mass, respectively. Age of H. terasensis between 1 and 44 days can be estimated either by length of forearm when forearm length is Յ91 mm or by length of total epiphyseal gap when forearm length is Ͼ91 mm. Subsequent monitoring suggested that males of H. terasensis are capable of reaching sexual maturity in their 1st year and females in their 2nd year. When compared with other bats, growth rate of H. terasensis was faster than that of many tropical species but slower than that of most temperate species.",

            "abstractNote": "The extent to which deterministic or stochastic processes affect the composition and morphological structure of communities is an intense debate in evolutionary ecology. For many years, competition was considered to be the dominant deterministic factor that affected structure of animal communities. More specifically, interspecific competition can affect morpho­ logical patterns within communities by either size assortment or size adjustment. We investigated the extent to which size assortment could have structured bat assemblages from two well-defined bat communities from northeast Brazil by comparing real ecomorphological characteristics (mean and variance of segment lengths of minimum-spanning trees from principal component scores) to the distribution of like statistics obtained from simulations derived from nested-species pools. Regardless of species pool, the ecomorphological patterns of bat assemblages were no more structured than expected by random selection of taxa from the available species pool. This was true for frugivorous, nectarivorous, and foliage-gleaning insectivorous guilds, and for the phyl­ lostomid community in general, from both Caatinga and edaphic Cerrado biomes. The alternative hypothesis, that coevolutionary processes determine ecomorphological patterns in these neotropical communities, similarly is not supported by our results. The characteristic spatial and temporal heterogeneity of northeast Brazil, combined with the mobile nature of bats, could decrease the intensity, pervasiveness, or predominance of deterministic interactions, thereby leading to an ecomorphological structure indistinguishable from that produced by stochastic processes.",

Analysis of molecular variance revealed a very strong genetic structure among 5 regions in H. armiger. A neighbor-joining tree, haplotype network construction by TCS and multidimensional scaling plots all showed signiﬁcant geographic differentiation among 5 regions. The high genetic structure detected in H. armiger could be a consequence of poor dispersal ability, local adaptation, or marked female philopatry. The lack of genetic structure among 3 regions separated by the Gaoligong Range and the Qiongzhou Strait could be due to incomplete lineage sorting. Our estimated times of divergence for H. armiger populations suggested a relatively recent split. The S Yunnan population with the highest genetic diversity and the Hainan population with the lowest genetic diversity should be equally given priority for conservation. Although H. armiger has been shown to carry viruses implicated in human disease, we ﬁnd little evidence for population mixing. We thus suggest minimizing disturbance to bats’ roosting caves for minimizing the potential risk of virus transmission.",

Bats under stressful conditions, for example when confronted by a predator, will emit aggressive social calls. The presentation of aggressive social calls, including distress calls (DCs), is known to increase heart rate (fH), but how this change in fH is related to the bat’s sound perception and how this evokes behaviors such as the fear response is unknown. Herein, we show that the perception of a distress context induces freezing behavior as a fear response in bats. We found that bats responded by freezing and displayed increased fH when they were presented with a conspecific donor bat in a distress situation evoked by gentle poking with a cotton swab. In addition, when we presented two types of auditory oddball paradigms with different probabilities of DCs and echolocation calls (ECs), the bats’ fH increased when DCs were presented as deviant or control stimuli within standard ECs but did not increase when DCs were presented as standard stimuli. These results suggest that the situational context created by the frequency of sound presentation, rather than simply a single sound feature, induces fH increases and freezing as fear responses in bats.",

A phylogenetic reconstruction of this pathogen, using partial sequences of arf, H-anti, ole1, and tub1 protein-coding genes, proposed that H. capsulatum has at least 11 phylogenetic species, highlighting a clade (BAC1) comprising three H. capsulatum isolates from infected bats captured in Mexico. Here, relationships for each individual locus and the concatenated coding regions of these genes were inferred using parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference methods. Coalescent-based analyses, a concatenated sequence-types (CSTs) network, and nucleotide diversities were also evaluated. The results suggest that six H. capsulatum isolates from the migratory bat Tadarida brasiliensis together with one isolate from a Mormoops megalophylla bat support a NAm 3 clade, replacing the formerly reported BAC1 clade. In addition, three H. capsulatum isolates from T. brasiliensis were classiﬁed as lineages. The concatenated sequence analyses and the CSTs network validate these ﬁndings, suggesting that NAm 3 is related to the North American class 2 clade and that both clades could share a recent common ancestor. Our results provide original information on the geographic distribution, genetic diversity, and host speciﬁcity of H. capsulatum.",

All the Myotis species produced typical FM call pattern with similar echolocation call shapes and outer shapes, producing steep, downward frequency-modulated calls. A pulse has two harmonies, which consist of the first harmony with wider bandwidth and the second harmony with narrower bandwidth. The PF of the first harmony is higher than that of the second harmony. The typical FM call structure, with two harmonies and wide bandwidth, might be highly related to fast flying and wide screening in the dense forests. In classification of the echolocation calls by DFA, most of calls from the five species could be well correctly classified. All calls of M. nettereri (100% of 17 calls), M. formosus (95.5% of 22 calls) and M. ikonnikovi (85.7% of 70 calls) could be well discriminated from those of the other species, whereas calls of M. petax and M. macrodactylus could be discriminated by 70.4% of 98 calls and 76.7% of 60 calls, respectively. Our results indicate that the five Korean Myotis species can be well identified by the echolocation calls with high correct classification by DFA.",

However, few long-term, rigorously designed assessments of bat populations exist, particularly in western North America. Consequently, results of informal monitoring efforts are often the only data available upon which to base population assessments. We evaluated whether an opportunistic collection of surveys recorded over a 22-y period could be used to assess population trend of Townsend’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii) at Lava Beds National Monument in northern California. We used records of counts of hibernating bats conducted during 1991–2012 to estimate the number of bats in 52 individual caves as well as cumulatively. Seventeen of 22 caves surveyed in four or more years had an increasing trend in the number of hibernating bats. We estimated the cumulative annual growth rate over the period to be 1.79%. Stable or increasing number of hibernating Townsend’s big-eared bats may be a result of management actions taken to limit disturbance of bats during maternity and hibernation seasons. We found no evidence that annual counts depressed the number of hibernating bats, thereby broadening monitoring options and the ability to link population trends to extrinsic factors. Our results demonstrate that opportunistically collected, long-term data sets may be useful for establishing first approximations of population trends for bats.",

With an expected higher copulation rate, harem males may deplete seminal fluids or increase epididymal sperm maturation, generating poor sperm quality. In a first study, we reported a higher sperm quality in sneaker males of Carollia perspicillata. To test whether the lower sperm quality observed in harem males was generated by an elevated copulation rate, we temporarily removed males of both social statuses from the colony. We thus assessed status-related changes of sperm quality resulting from sexual abstinence. Moreover, released from territory and female guarding, harem males were expected to show a reduction in somatic costs. On the basis of sperm competition models, we predicted a higher resource investment in the ejaculate with the reduction of pre-copulatory efforts. In line with our predictions, sperm quality of harem males improved significantly in contrast to sneaker males, whose sperm quality did not change. Without an increase in ejaculate lipid peroxidation, our results also provide evidence that the duration of sexual abstinence was not sufficient to generate sperm oxidative damage through senescence. Harem males did not show a reduction in blood lipid peroxidation or in the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione. In line with the maintenance of these somatic costs, harem males did not invest more superoxide dismutase to the ejaculate to maintain sperm quality. Our results suggest that a difference in copulation rate rather than an adaptation to sperm competition provides sneaker males with higher sperm quality in C. perspicillata.",

Hence, bats which are resident at northern latitudes throughout the year will need to undergo a long hibernation season and a short reproductive season where foraging time is limited by extended daylight periods. Eptesicus nilssonii is the northernmost occurring bat species worldwide and hibernates locally when ambient temperatures (Ta) limit prey availability. Therefore, we investigated the energy spent maintaining normothermy at different Ta, as well as how much bats limit energy expenditure while in torpor. We found that, despite being exposed to Ta as low as 1.1°C, bats did not increase torpid metabolic rate, thus indicating that E. nilssonii can survive and hibernate at low ambient temperatures. Furthermore, we found a lower critical temperature (Tlc) of 27.8°C, which is lower than in most other vespertilionid bats, and we found no indication of any metabolic response to Ta up to 37.1°C. Interestingly, carbon dioxide production increased with increasing Ta above the Tlc, presumably caused by a release of retained CO2 in bats that remained in torpor for longer and aroused at Ta above the Tlc. Our results indicate that E. nilssonii can thermoconform at near-freezing Ta, and hence maintain longer torpor bouts with limited energy expenditure, yet also cope with high Ta when sun exposed in roosts during long summer days. These physiological traits are likely to enable the species to cope with ongoing and predicted climate change.",

            "abstractNote": "To cope with periods of low food availability and unsuitable environmental conditions (e.g., short photoperiod or challenging weather), many heterothermic mammals can readily go into torpor to save energy. However, torpor also entails several potential costs, and quantitative energetics can, therefore, be influenced by the individual state, such as available energy reserves. We studied the thermal energetics of brown long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus) in the northern part of its distributional range, including torpor entry, thermoregulatory ability during torpor and how they responded metabolically to an increasing ambient temperature (Ta) during arousal from torpor. Torpor entry occurred later in bats with higher body mass (Mb). During torpor, only 10 out of 21 bats increased oxygen consumption (V̇O2) to a greater extent above the mean torpor metabolic rates (TMR) when exposed to low Ta. The slope of the torpid thermoregulatory curve was shallower than that of resting metabolic rate (RMR) during normothermic conditions, indicating a higher thermal insulation during torpor. During exposure to an increasing Ta, all bats increased metabolic rate exponentially, but the bats with higher Mb aroused at a lower Ta than those with lower Mb. In bats with low Mb, arousal was postponed to an Ta above the lower critical temperature of the thermoneutral zone. Our results demonstrate that physiological traits, which are often considered fixed, can be more flexible than previously assumed and vary with individual state. Thus, future studies of thermal physiology should to a greater extent take individual state-dependent effects into account.",

In this study, we recorded the echolocation behavior of a broadband FM (Pipistrellus abramus) and a narrowband CF echolocator species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum nippon) while they explored an unfamiliar space in a laboratory chamber. During flight, P. abramus smoothly shifted its acoustic gaze in relation to its flight direction, whereas R. ferrumequinum nippon frequently shifted its acoustic gaze from side to side. The distribution of the acoustic gazes of R. ferrumequinum nippon was twice as wide as that of P. abramus. Furthermore, R. ferrumequinum nippon produced double pulses twice as often as P. abramus. Because R. ferrumequinum nippon has a horizontal beam width (−6 dB off-axis angle) half as wide (±20.8 ± 6.0°) as that of P. abramus (±38.3 ± 6.0°), it appears to double the width of its acoustical field of view by shifting its acoustic gaze further off-axis and emitting direction-shifted double pulses. These results suggest that broadband FM and narrowband CF bats actively control their acoustic gazes in a speciesspecific manner based on the acoustic features of their echolocation signals.",

            "abstractNote": "Migration and hibernation in mammals may be preceded by a period of leptin resistance, which may in part account for the increasing adiposity and body mass that occurs during these periods. We hypothesized that hypothalamic expression of leptin receptor mRNA would decrease during the premigration (PM) period in the little brown myotis, Myotis lucifugus. Body mass of M. lucifugus increased during the PM period, but serum leptin levels did not change during that time. Hypothalamic mRNA levels for both the short (ObRa) and fully active long (ObRb) forms of the leptin receptor increased during PM, but the relative increase in ObRa was larger and occurred sooner than ObRb. mRNA levels of an inhibitor of leptin signaling (protein inhibitor of activated STAT3: PIAS3) increased in hypothalami during the PM period in bats. Adiponectin is an adipokine that has been linked to obesity in rodents; normally, serum levels of adiponectin decrease in obesity. In M. lucifugus, adiponectin mRNA levels decreased in adipose tissue during the period of mass gain, but circulating adiponectin levels did not change. We conclude that the relative changes in leptin receptor isoform expression during the PM fattening period may favor binding of leptin to the less active short isoform. Coupled with increased expression of PIAS3 and the dissociation of serum leptin levels from body mass and adiposity, these changes could account in part for the adaptive fattening during the PM period. In addition, the adipokine proWles of M. lucifugus during the PM period and that of obesity in non-hibernating mammals are strikingly dissimilar.",

The rms values and their significance for threshold determination depended strongly on the filtering of the signal. Using the minimum threshold values obtained at three different low-frequency filter corner frequencies (30, 100, 300 Hz), ABR threshold curves were calculated. The course of the ABR thresholds was comparable to that of published DPOAE (distortion-product otoacoustic emission) thresholds based on a − 10 dB SPL threshold criterion for the 2f1–f2 emission (Schlenther et al. in J Assoc Res Otolaryngol 15:695–705, 2014, frequency range 10–90 kHz). For frequencies between 20 and 80 kHz, which is the most sensitive part of the bat’s audiogram, median thresholds ranged between 10 and 28 dB SPL, and the DPOAE thresholds ranged between 10 and 23 dB SPL. At frequencies below 20 kHz (5–20 kHz) and above 80 kHz (80–120 kHz), ABR thresholds increased by 20 dB/octave and 45 dB/octave, respectively. We conclude that the combination of objective threshold determination and multiple filtering of the signal gives reliable ABR thresholds comparable to cochlear threshold curves.",

Echoes from frontally located targets arrive with first and second harmonics intact, leading to focused delay images. Echoes from offside or distant objects arrive with the second harmonic relatively weaker (lowpass-filtered), leading to defocused images, which prevents their clutter interference effects (Bates et al. J Exp Biol 214:394–401, 2011). Realistic targets contain several glints at slightly different distances and reflect several echoes at correspondingly different delays. The bat registers the delay of the nearest glint’s echoes in the time domain. The delays of echoes from the farther glints are registered in the frequency domain, from interference nulls in the spectrum. Lowpass-filtering of echoes directly affects the image of the nearest glint by defocusing the delay image. However, lowpass-filtering also is superimposed on the interference spectrum used to register the farther glints, which distorts the pattern of interference nulls, defocusing the farther glints inversely, in the spectral domain, before they are perceived as delays. Differences in blurring between time-domain and frequency-domain parts of images identifies separate computational paths to perceptually reconstruct objects and prevent interference from offside or distant clutter.",

Nectar-feeding bats Glossophaga commissarisi selectively visit unexploded, ‘‘virgin’’ ﬂowers. They can discriminate buds, virgin and exploded ﬂowers using echolocation. In ﬁeld experiments bats exploited virgin ﬂowers, the vexillum of which had been replaced by a same-sized triple mirror or by an artiﬁcial vexillum. Such ﬂowers were frequently inspected, but not as often exploited as natural ﬂowers. In two-alternative-forcedchoice experiments the bats learned to discriminate between replicas of the vexillum and triple mirrors. The recognition distance was between 15 and 50 cm. Echoes of the three ﬂowering stages diﬀer in their spectral composition, which changes in dependence of the sound incidence angle in a characteristic way. We conclude that glossophagine bats are able to recognize small motionless structures like ﬂowers and to accurately adjust their landing manoeuvres by using their echolocation system alone.",

At post-mortem examination, the bat was emaciated and had multifocal to coalescent grey, crusted, dry, scaly cutaneous lesions, irregularly distributed over the dorsal thoracoabdominal region, muzzle, labial commissures, ears and dorsoventral surfaces of the patagia. Histopathology revealed numerous longitudinal and transverse sections of fungal organisms, with weakly basophilic walls, associated with multifocal areas of ulceration of the epidermis, necrosis, rupture and discontinuity of collagen ﬁbres in the dermis without any inﬂammatory response. Molecular identiﬁcation matched the organism to Cladosporium spp, Curvularia spp, Exserohilum spp, Bipolaris spp (100%) and Alternaria spp (97%), all of which have been associated with phaeohyphomycosis. Phaeohyphomycosis should be included as a differential diagnosis of cutaneous lesions in chiropterans.",

Guano cores have been collected from several locations (e.g., United States, Romania, Philippines, and southeast Asia), and the processing and collection methods are quite similar despite a lack of standardized techniques. Physical, chemical, and elemental analyses on guano samples have focused on the interpretation of precipitation changes over time, with additional applications from stable isotope analysis being used for other paleoenvironmental conditions. We obtained three bat guano cores from Alabama and Tennessee to evaluate the collecting and processing techniques of guano. Climatic temperature changes were not analyzed in this study. The purpose of this investigation was to summarize multiple techniques and approaches used to process and analyze bat guano cores with a focus on reconstructing paleoclimate in cave environments throughout the globe. From these three cores, we describe challenges and make recommendations for improving guano analysis.",

            "abstractNote": "Borneo is a biodiversity and ecotourism hotspot, yet one of its least-studied ecosystems is their limestone caves. Not many studies have been conducted on the role fungi play in tropical cave ecosystems, and no fungal surveys have been conducted in the caves of Sabah, Malaysia. Here, we assess the mycofloral diversity on bat and arthropod cadavers in one of the most popular ecotourism destinations of northern Borneo, Gomantong caves. Opportunistic sampling of cadavers within the Semud Hitam chamber of Gomantong cave yielded nine dead arthropods and four dead bats. Twenty-four culturable fungi were isolated, of which 14 morphological taxonomic units (MTU) were observed. Twelve of the 14 MTUs underwent molecular characterization of the ITS gene region to confirm identification. All fungi were Ascomycetes except for one Basidiomycete isolate. Aspergillus spp. had the highest occurrence (45.8%), followed by Penicillium spp. (25.0%), and Fusarium sp. (12.5%). Ceratobasidium sp., Diaporthe sp., Pestalotiopsis sp., and Xylaria feejeensis were isolated once each. No more than one fungal taxon was isolated from each arthropod cadaver, and not all arthropods yielded culturable fungi. Bat cadavers yielded 14 out of 24 isolates (58.3%), with the highest occurrence of the fungi sampled from their skin. Our results corroborate that bats and arthropods play a role in fungal dispersion and introduction in the cave because their exteriors are likely to harbor fungi they are exposed to in the environment. We also conclude that cadavers are important substrates for fungal growth and proliferation, perpetuating the role of fungi as important decomposers in caves. This study provides a baseline of information of the mycobiome of Bornean caves for future bioprospecting and potential biotechnological applications.",

One recent distinction is between Grinnellian niche characteristics that reflect influences at large spatial scales such as climate and Eltonian niche characteristics that reflect influences at the local level such as distribution of resources and their allocation among species. Aims of this research were to estimate Grinnellian and Eltonian niche characteristics of phyllostomid bats distributed throughout the Atlantic Forest, examine degree of phylogenetic non-­independence of distribution and niche characteristics, and estimate the relative contribution of niche characteristics to distribution across this large Neotropical region.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              \n                \n                  Logging is the most widespread disturbance in tropical forests, altering ecological communities and functions. However, many species can persist in logged forests, particularly where disturbance is low. Despite a growing understanding of how logging affects wildlife, there remains little information for Southeast Asia's bats—in part due to major challenges in monitoring.\n                \n                \n                  We integrated remote sensing data from passive acoustic bat detectors with LiDAR‐derived measures of forest structure from a human‐modified landscape in Sabah, Borneo. Our appraisal of logging effects benefitted from a semi‐automated classifier of bat calls that vastly speeds up the analysis of acoustic recording data. We recorded 105,576 bat passes from 21 phonic groups across a habitat disturbance gradient, comprising old‐growth forest, repeatedly logged forest and tree plantations.\n                \n                \n                  We show that logging pressure (as depicted by changes to habitat quality, e.g. canopy height or shape) had negligible impact on the acoustic activity of bats. However, bat activity was higher in areas with a greater extent of high‐biomass forest, as well as areas with greater topographical ruggedness. Logged forest supported higher levels of activity for several common bat phonic groups compared to old‐growth forest. Across the landscape, plantations supported the lowest levels of bat activity, representing a threefold decrease compared to old‐growth forest, and several species were not recorded in this habitat.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We found different call groups demonstrated different responses to forest disturbance. Sheath‐tailed bats (\n                    Emballonura\n                    spp.) were active across all habitat types and were the most resilient to logging. Edge/open foragers were more prevalent in highly forested and topographically rugged areas. Horseshoe and leaf‐nosed bats (flutter clutter foragers) demonstrated idiosyncratic responses to logging but were consistently absent from plantations.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Logged forests can provide an important refuge for many common bat species in Southeast Asia, but do not capture the full breadth of forest‐specialist species. Nevertheless, logged forests provide substantially better habitat for bats than tree plantations. While aerial insectivorous bats sampled via acoustic methods are poor indicators of forest disturbance overall, several species that respond predictably to logging could be targeted for biodiversity monitoring using acoustic and capture‐based methods.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Ringkasan\n            \n              \n                \n                  Pembalakan merupakan gangguan yang paling meluas di hutan tropika, mengubah komuniti dan fungsi ekologi. Walau bagaimanapun, banyak spesies boleh bertahan di hutan yang telah dibalak, terutamanya apabila tahap gangguan adalah rendah. Walaupun pemahaman semakin meningkat tentang impak pembalakan terhadap hidupan liar, masih sedikit maklumat tentang kelawar Asia Tenggara ‐ sebahagiannya disebabkan oleh cabaran utama dalam pemantauan.\n                \n                \n                  Kami menggabungkan data penderiaan jauh daripada pengesan kelawar akustik pasif dengan ukuran struktur hutan yang diperolehi melalui LiDAR daripada landskap yang diubah‐suai manusia di Sabah, Borneo. Penilaian kami terhadap kesan pembalakan mendapat manfaat daripada pengelas separa automatik bagi panggilan kelawar yang sangat mempercepatkan analisis data rakaman akustik. Kami merekodkan 105,576 lintasan kelawar daripada 21 kumpulan fonik merentasi kecerunan gangguan habitat, yang terdiri daripada hutan tua, hutan yang telah dibalak berulang kali dan ladang pokok.\n                \n                \n                  Kami menunjukkan bahawa tekanan pembalakan (seperti yang digambarkan oleh perubahan kepada kualiti habitat cth. ketinggian atau bentuk kanopi) tidak mempunyai kesan yang signifikan ke atas aktiviti akustik kelawar. Walau bagaimanapun, aktiviti kelawar adalah lebih tinggi di kawasan yang mempunyai keluasan hutan dengan biojisim yang lebih besar dan di kawasan yang mempunyai topografi yang lebih kasar. Hutan yang telah dibalak menyokong tahap aktiviti yang lebih tinggi untuk beberapa kumpulan fonik kelawar biasa berbanding dengan hutan tua. Secara keseluruhannya, kawasan ladang pokok menyokong tahap aktiviti kelawar yang paling rendah, iaitu mewakili penurunan sebanyak tiga kali ganda berbanding dengan hutan tua, dan terdapat beberapa spesies yang tidak direkodkan di habitat ini.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Kami mendapati kumpulan panggilan yang berbeza menunjukkan respons yang berbeza terhadap gangguan hutan. Kelawar berekor sarung (\n                    Emballonura\n                    spp.) adalah aktif di semua jenis habitat dan paling berdaya tahan terhadap impak pembalakan. Kelawar dari kumpulan pencari makanan di habitat pinggir/terbuka lebih banyak ditemui di kawasan yang berhutan dan dengan topografi yang kasar. Kelawar tapak kuda dan kelawar berhidung daun (pemakan flutter clutter) menunjukkan respons yang unik terhadap pembalakan tetapi secara konsisten tidak dijumpai di kawasan ladang.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Sintesis dan aplikasi.\n                    Hutan yang telah dibalak boleh menyediakan kawasan perlindungan yang penting kepada banyak spesies kelawar biasa di Asia Tenggara, tetapi ia tidak dapat menampung kesemua spesies yang hanya hidup di kawasan hutan. Sungguhpun demikian, hutan yang telah dibalak menyediakan habitat yang jauh lebih baik untuk kelawar berbanding dengan ladang pokok. Walaupun kelawar insektivor udara yang dijadikan sampel melalui kaedah akustik dalam kajian ini adalah penunjuk yang lemah terhadap impak gangguan habitat hutan secara keseluruhannya, beberapa spesies yang menunjukkan respons yang telah dijangka terhadap impak pembalakan boleh digunakan dalam pemantauan biodiversiti dengan menggunakan kaedah berasaskan akustik dan tangkapan.",

One untested hypothesis is that this morphology allows the transfer of a sound signal from the larynx to the tympanic bones (auditory bulla) via the hyoid apparatus during signal production by the larynx. We used µCT data and finite element analysis to model the propagation of sound through the hyoid chain into the tympanic bones to test this hypothesis. We modeled sound pressure (dB) wave propagation from the basihyal to the tympanic bones, vibratory behavior (m) of the stylohyal—­tympanic bone unit, and the stylohyal and tympanic bones when the stylohyal bone is allowed to pivot on the tympanic bone. Sound pressure wave propagation was modeled using the harmonic acoustics solver in ANSYS and vibratory behavior was modeled using coupled modal and harmonic response analyses in ANSYS. For both analyses (harmonic acoustics and harmonic response), the input excitation on the basihyal and thyrohyals was modeled as the estimated pressure (Pa) imposed by the collision of the vibrating thyroid cartilage of the larynx against these bones during signal production. Our models support the hypothesis that this stereotypical hyoid morphology found in laryngeally echolocating bats can transfer sound to the auditory bullae at an amplitude that is likely heard for the species Artibeus jamaicensis and Rhinolophus pusillus.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) is a wildlife disease that has decimated hibernating bats since its introduction in North America in 2006. As the disease spreads westward, assessing the potentially differential impact of the disease on western bat species is an urgent conservation need. The statistical challenge is that the disease surveillance and species response monitoring data are not co-located, available at different spatial resolutions, non-Gaussian, and subject to observation error requiring a novel extension to spatially misaligned regression models for analysis. Previous work motivated by epidemiology applications has proposed two-step approaches that overcome the spatial misalignment while intentionally preventing the human health outcome from informing estimation of exposure. In our application, the impacted animals contribute to spreading the fungus that causes WNS, motivating development of a joint framework that exploits the known biological relationship. We introduce a Bayesian, joint spatial modeling framework that provides inferences about the impact of WNS on measures of relative bat activity and accounts for the uncertainty in estimation of WNS presence at non-surveyed locations. Our simulations demonstrate that the joint model produced more precise estimates of disease occurrence and unbiased estimates of the association between disease presence and the count response relative to competing two-step approaches. Our statistical framework provides a solution that leverages disparate monitoring activities and informs species conservation across large landscapes. Stan code and documentation are provided to facilitate access and adaptation for other wildlife disease applications.",

In parasite-associated microbial communities, it is hypothesized that evolution and ecology of an arthropod parasite will influence its microbiome more than broader environmental factors, but this hypothesis has not been extensively tested. To examine the influence of the broader environment on the parasite microbiome, we applied high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA to characterize the microbiome of 222 obligate ectoparasitic bat flies (Streblidae and Nycteribiidae) collected from 155 bats (representing six species) from ten habitat fragments in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. Parasite species identity is the strongest driver of microbiome composition. To a lesser extent, reduction in habitat fragment area, but not isolation, is associated with an increase in connectance and betweenness centrality of bacterial association networks driven by changes in the diversity of the parasite community. Controlling for the parasite community, bacterial network topology covaries with habitat patch area and exhibits parasite-species specific responses to environmental change. Taken together, habitat loss may have cascading consequences for communities of interacting macro- and microorgansims.",

            "abstractNote": "While bats are often referred to as reservoirs of viral pathogens, a meta-analysis of the literature reveals many cases in which there is not enough evidence to claim so. In many cases, bats are able to confront viruses, recover, and remain immune by developing a potent titer of antibodies, often without becoming a reservoir. In other cases, bats might have carried an ancestral virus that at some time point might have mutated into a human pathogen. Moreover, bats exhibit a balanced immune response against viruses that have evolved over millions of years. Using genomic tools, it is now possible to obtain a deeper understanding of that unique immune system and its variability across the order Chiroptera. We conclude, that with the exception of a few viruses, bats pose little zoonotic danger to humans and that they operate a highly efﬁcient anti-inﬂammatory response that we should strive to understand.",

Heavily infected individuals introduce disproportionate numbers of infective stages into host populations or surrounding environments, causing sharp increases in frequency of infection. Parasite aggregation within host populations may result from variation among hosts in exposure to infective propagules and probability of subsequent establishment of parasites in the host. This is because individual host heterogeneities contribute to a pattern of parasite overdispersion that emerges at the population level. We quantiﬁed relative roles of host exposure and parasite establishment in producing variation in parasite burdens, to predict which hosts are more likely to bear heavy burdens, using big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and their helminths as a model system. We captured bats from seven colonies in Michigan and Indiana, USA, assessed their helminth burdens, and collected data on intrinsic and extrinsic variables related to exposure, establishment, or both. Digenetic trematodes had the highest prevalence and mean abundance while cestodes and nematodes had much lower prevalence and mean abundance. Structural equation modeling revealed that best-ﬁtting models to explain variations in parasite burden included genetic heterozygosity and immunocompetence as well as distance to the nearest water source and the year of host capture. Thus, both differential host exposure and differential parasite establishment signiﬁcantly inﬂuence heterogeneous helminth burdens, thus driving population-level patterns of parasite aggregation.",

Accurate whole genome and transcriptome annotations are essential for the study of bat biological evolution. The lack of a whole genome for M. pilosus has limited our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the species’ evolution, echolocation, and immune response. In the present work, we sequenced the entire transcriptome using error-corrected PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) data. Then, a total of 40 GB of subreads were generated, including 29,991 full-length non-chimeric (FLNC) sequences. After correction by Illumina short reads and de-redundancy, we obtained 26,717 error-corrected isoforms with an average length of 3018.91 bp and an N50 length of 3447 bp. A total of 1528 alternative splicing (AS) events were detected by transcriptome structural analysis. Furthermore, 1032 putative transcription factors (TFs) were identiﬁed, with additional identiﬁcation of several long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with high conﬁdence. Moreover, several key genes, including PRL-2, DPP4, Glul, and ND1 were also identiﬁed as being associated with metabolism, immunity, nervous system processes, and auditory perception. A multitude of pattern recognition receptors was identiﬁed, including NLR, RLR, SRCR, the antiviral molecule IRF3, and the IFN receptor subunit IFNAR1. High-quality reference genomes at the transcriptome level may be used to quantify gene or transcript expression, evaluate alternative splicing levels, identify novel transcripts, and enhance genome annotation in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding how natural selection shapes unique traits in mammals is a central topic in evolutionary biology. The mammalian order Chiroptera (bats) is attractive for biologists as well as the general public due to their speciﬁc traits of extraordinary immunity and inverted resting posture. However, genomic resources for bats that occupy key phylogenetic positions are not sufﬁcient, which hinders comprehensive investigation of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the origin of speciﬁc traits in bats. Here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of 5 bats that are phylogenetically divergent and occupy key positions in the phylogenetic tree of bats. In combination with the available genomes of 19 bats and 21 other mammals, we built a database consisting of 10 918 one-to-one ortholog genes and reconstructed phylogenetic relationships of these mammals. We found that genes related to immunity, bone remodeling, and cardiovascular system are targets of natural selection along the ancestral branch of bats. Further analyses revealed that the T cell receptor signaling pathway involved in immune adaptation is speciﬁcally enriched in bats. Moreover, molecular adaptations of bone remodeling, cardiovascular system, and balance sensing may help to explain the reverted resting posture in bats. Our study provides valuable transcriptome resources, enabling us to tentatively identify genetic changes associated with bat-speciﬁc traits. This work is among the ﬁrst to advance our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of inverted resting posture in bats, which could provide insight into healthcare applications such as hypertension in humans.",

Previous finite element modeling (FEM) found that hyoid-borne sound can reach the bulla at an amplitude likely heard by echolocating bats; however, that study did not model how or if the signal could reach the inner ear (or cochlea). One route that sound could take is via stimulation of the eardrum—similarly to that of air-conducted sound. We used micro computed tomography (μCT) data to build models of the hyoid apparatus and middle ear from six species of bats with variable morphology. Using FEM, we ran harmonic response analyses to measure the vibroacoustic response of the tympanic membrane due to hyoid-borne sound generated during echolocation and found that hyoid-borne sound in all six species stimulated the eardrum within a range likely heard by bats. Although there was variation in the efficiency between models, there are no obvious morphological patterns to account for it. This suggests that hyoid morphology in laryngeal echolocators is likely driven by other associated functions.",

Since 2013, a large group of orthohepadnaviruses has been identiﬁed in bats worldwide and classiﬁed as 4 species within the genus Orthohepadnavirus. To further investigate orthohepadnaviruses in the Chinese bat population, 554 archived bat samples from 20 colonies covering 3 southern provinces were screened with results showing that 9 (1.6%) were positive. A systematic phylogenetic analysis has indicated the need for a new nomenclature for bat hepatitis B virus-like viruses: BtHBV, with the addition of 3 new species, one being divided into 6 genotypes. Viruses identiﬁed here shared 9.0–19.2% full genome divergence and classiﬁed into 3 diﬀerent genotypes. This study illustrates the genetic diversity of orthohepadnaviruses in the Chinese bat population, and emphasizes need for further investigation of their public health signiﬁcance.",

In this molecular epidemiology study, CanPV was detected in 15 (1.11%) of 1347 canine fecal samples from Hong Kong and one (0.76%) of 131 canine fecal samples from Dubai, with viral loads 1.06×103 to 6.64×106 copies/ml. Complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that CanPV was clustered with feline picornavirus (FePV), bat picornavirus (BatPV) 1 to 3, Ia io picornavirus 1 (IaioPV1) and bovine picornavirus (BoPV), and this cluster was most closely related to the genera Enterovirus and Sapelovirus. The Ka/Ks ratios of all the coding regions were b 0.1. According to the deﬁnition of the Picornavirus Study Group of ICTV, CanPV, FePV, BatPV 1 to 3, IaioPV1 and BoPV should constitute a novel genus in Picornaviridae. BEAST analysis showed that this genus diverged from its most closely related genus, Sapelovirus, about 49 years ago.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats have a long evolutionary history with trypanosomatids, but the role of these flying mammals on parasite transmission cycles in urban areas, especially for Trypanosoma and Leishmania species, remains poorly known. The objective of this study was to evaluate the species richness of trypanosomatids parasitizing a bat community in Campo Grande (CG), a state capital within the Cerrado of the Brazilian Midwest. We evaluated 237 bats of 13 species by means of hemoculture and molecular detection in spleen samples. The bat community of CG appears to participate in the transmission cycles of various species of trypanosomatids. We report an overall trypano­ somatid detection rate of 34.2% (n = 81), involving 11 out of 13 sampled bat species. We identified six species of trypanosomatids from 61 bats by analyzing SSU rRNA and/or kDNA: Trypanosoma cruzi DTU TcI, T. c. marinkellei, T. dionisii, Leishmania infantum, L. amazonensis, and T. janseni, with this latter being detected by hemoculture for the first time in a bat species. We also detected a Molecular Operational Taxonomic Unit, Trypanosoma sp. DID, in the phyllostomids Glossophaga soricina and Platyrrhinus lineatus. The highest trypanosomatid richness was observed for Sturnira lilium, which hosted three species: L. infantum, T. dionisii and T. janseni. Given that visceral leishmaniasis is endemic in CG, special focus should be placed on L. infantum. Moreover, L. amazonensis and T. cruzi warrant attention, since these are zoonotic parasites responsible for human cases of tegumentary leishmaniasis and Chagas disease, respectively. In this respect, we discuss how bat communities may influence the Leishmania spp. transmission in endemic areas.",

During the survey for Nipah virus among bats at North-East region of India; Tioman virus (TioV), a new member of the Paramyxoviridae family was isolated from tissues of Pteropus giganteus bats for the ﬁrst time in India. This isolate was identiﬁed and conﬁrmed by RT-PCR, sequence analysis and electron microscopy. A range of vertebrate cell lines were shown to be susceptible to Tioman virus. Negative electron microscopy study revealed the “herringbone” morphology of the nucleocapsid ﬁlaments and enveloped particles with distinct envelope projections a characteristic of the Paramyxoviridae family. Sequence analysis of Nucleocapsid gene of TioV demonstrated sequence identity of 99.87% and 99.99% nucleotide and amino acid respectively with of TioV strain isolated in Malaysia, 2001. This report demonstrates the ﬁrst isolation of Tioman virus from a region where Nipah virus activity has been noticed in the past and recent years. Bat-borne viruses have become serious concern world-wide. A Survey of bats for novel viruses in this region would help in recognizing emerging viruses and combating diseases caused by them. © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

            "abstractNote": "The spatial dynamics of zoonotic arthropod-borne viruses is a fashionable though challenging topic. Inter-human local transmission of a given arbovirus during an outbreak and its spread over large distances are considered as key parameters of emergence. Here, we suggest that insular ecosystems provide ideal natural ‘‘laboratory’’ conditions to uncouple local transmission from long distance spread, and differentiate these two processes. Due to geographic isolation, often-limited land surface area and relatively homogenous ecosystems, oceanic islands display low species richness and often-high levels of endemism. These aspects provide the means for comprehensive entomological surveys and investigations of original host/pathogen interactions. In addition, islands are interconnected through discrete anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic exchanges: whilst islands maintain a substantial level of human and domestic animal exchange with other neighbouring or distant territories, they also comprise dispersal and migratory pathways of volant organisms (insects, birds and bats). Hence, both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic exchanges in island systems are easier to identify and investigate than in continuous, continental systems. Finally, island ecosystems tend to be notably simpler, more prone to invasive taxa and, therefore, easier to document the colonization or displacement of vector species. These different aspects are presented and overlaid upon the spread of arboviruses within two distinct insular systems: islands of Polynesia and the south-western Indian Ocean. The former have been repeatedly affected by Dengue fever epidemics, while the latter recently suffered four successive epidemics, probably of east African origin, three of which involved the emerging viruses Chikungunya, Rift Valley and Dengue fever. Here, we review some new insights into arboviral spread and evolution associated with investigations that followed these epidemics, as well as several aspects that make insular ecosystems favourable to the investigation of arboviral transmission and spread.",

We recorded bird ﬂight intensities using radar during autumn migration at four wind farms situated within a major migration ﬂyway in northern Germany and simultaneously conducted systematic searches for collision fatalities at the same sites. We found that migration trafﬁc rates at rotor height estimated by radar observations were signiﬁcantly higher during the night, yet strictly nocturnal migrants constituted only 8.6% of all fatalities at the wind farms. In contrast to the situation at other vertical structures, nocturnal migrants do not have a higher risk of collision with wind energy facilities than do diurnally active species, but rather appear to circumvent collision more effectively.",

Numerous operational techniques based on molecular or phenotypic data have been designed to overcome this problem, yet existing procedures remain subjective or inconsistent, particularly when applying the biological species concept. We address this issue by developing quantitative methods for a classic technique in systematic zoology, namely the use of divergence between undisputed sympatric species as a yardstick for assessing the taxonomic status of allopatric forms. We calculated mean levels of differentiation in multiple phenotypic characters – including biometrics, plumage and voice – for 58 sympatric or parapatric species-pairs from 29 avian families. We then used estimates of mean divergence to develop criteria for species delimitation based on data-driven thresholds. Preliminary tests show that these criteria result in relatively few changes to avian taxonomy in Europe, yet are capable of extensive reassignment of species limits in poorly known tropical regions. While we recognize that species limits are in many cases inherently arbitrary, we argue that our system can be applied to the global avifauna to deliver taxonomic decisions with a high level of objectivity, consistency and transparency.",

            "abstractNote": "The ‘‘place ﬁelds’’ of hippocampal pyramidal neurons are not static. For example, upon a contextual change in the environment, place ﬁelds may ‘‘remap’’ within typical timescales of $1 min. A few studies have shown more rapid dynamics in hippocampal activity, linked to internal processes, such as switches between spatial reference frames or changes within the theta cycle. However, little is known about rapid hippocampal place ﬁeld dynamics in response to external, sensory stimuli. Here, we studied this question in big brown bats, echolocating mammals in which we can readily measure rapid changes in sensory dynamics (sonar signals), as well as rapid behavioral switches between distal and proximal exploratory modes. First, we show that place ﬁeld size was modulated by the availability of sensory information, on a timescale of $300 ms: Bat hippocampal place ﬁelds were smallest immediately after an echolocation call, but place ﬁelds ‘‘diffused’’ with the passage of time after the call, when echo information was no longer arriving. Second, we show rapid modulation of hippocampal place ﬁelds as the animal switched between two exploratory modes. Third, we compared place ﬁelds and spatial view ﬁelds of individual neurons and found that place tuning was much more pronounced than spatial view tuning. In addition, dynamic ﬂuctuations in spatial view tuning were stronger than ﬂuctuations in place tuning. Taken together, these results suggest that spatial representation in mammalian hippocampus can be very rapidly modulated by external sensory and behavioral events. VC 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

We compared six different land-use types around the roost sites to randomly selected points for each species to determine at which radiuses around the roost are land-use types most critical. We found that for the northern bat (Eptesicus nilssonii), built environment, open areas, and water within the 200 m radius were the most important in roost site selection. The Brandt’s myotis (Myotis brandtii) favored roost sites in landscape not affected by human disturbance within 5 km radius. Based on our results, the surrounding habitat around a roost plays a vital role for bat species, and it should be protected along with the roost and considered in land-use planning. Furthermore, species-specific variation in roost site selection should be considered in conservation planning.",

Based on historical reports for these species, these records represent the fifth-known locality for C. auritus and L. silvicolum, and the second for T. bakeri in Honduras, representing how poor these species are known in the country.

Behavioral experiments proved previously that smooth surfaces, such as solar panels act as sensory traps for bats and insects, increasing collision risk, and suggesting that solar farms may affect local ecosystems in a complex way. As the orientation of bats is impeded around smooth surfaces, the exploitation of solar farms as foraging habitats by bats needs research. We surveyed the activity of bats at solar farms and in the neighboring habitats (forests, grasslands, arable fields, settlements and watersides) to evaluate the effects of solar farms on the occurrence and activity of bats and on the composition of bat communities. We conducted bioacoustic surveys at 190 sites in 15 areas of Hungary and recorded nearly 30 000 bat echo­ location call sequences. We detected patterns of overall bat activity similar to those in other open habitats such as arable land and grassland indicating that some bat species can exploit this anthropogenic environment. Bat species detected at solar farms also frequently occur in arable land and settlements (Hypsugo savii, Nyctalus noctula and Pipistrellus kuhlii), suggesting that bats adapted to anthropogenic environments exploit solar farms. However, some species of major conservation concern (e.g. Myotis spp. and Barbastella barbastellus) were detected less frequently on solar farms than in other habitats raising implications for mitigation procedures.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are protected by national and international legislation in European countries, yet many species, particularly migratory aerial insectivores, collide with wind turbines which counteracts conservation efforts. Within the European Union it is legally required to curtail the operation of wind turbines at periods of high bat activity, yet this is not practiced at old wind turbines. Based on data from the national carcass repository in Germany and from our own carcass searches at a wind park with three turbines west of Berlin, we evaluated the magnitude of bat casualties at old, potentially poor-sited wind turbines operating without curtailment. We report 88 documented bat carcasses collected by various searchers over the 20-year operation period of this wind park from 2001 to 2021. Common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) and common pipistrelles (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) were most often found dead at these turbines. Our search campaign in August and September 2021 yielded a total of 18 carcasses. We estimated that at least 209 bats were likely killed during our field survey, yielding more than 70 casualties/wind turbine or 39 casualties/ MW in two months. Since our campaign covered only part of the migration season, we consider this value as an underestimate. The 20-year period of the wind park emphasises the substantial impact old turbines may have on bat individuals and populations when operating without cur­ tailments. We call for reconsidering the operation procedures of old wind turbines to stop the continuous loss of bats in Germany and other countries where turbine curtailments are even less practiced than in Germany.",

            "abstractNote": "Urbanization has significant impacts on wildlife and ecosystems and acts as an environmental filter excluding certain species from local ecological communities. Specifically, it may be challenging for some animals to find enough food in urban environments to achieve a positive energy balance. Because urban environments favor small-sized bats with low energy requirements, we hypothesized that common noctules (Nyctalus noctula) acquire food at a slower rate and rely less on conspecifics to find prey in urban than in rural environments due to a low food abundance and predictable distribution of insects in urban environments. To address this, we estimated prey sizes and measured prey capture rates, foraging efforts, and the presence of conspecifics during hunting of 22 common noctule bats equipped with sensor loggers in an urban and rural environment. Even though common noctule bats hunted similar-sized prey in both environments, urban bats captured prey at a lower rate (mean: 2.4 vs. 6.3 prey attacks/min), and a lower total amount of prey (mean: 179 vs. 377 prey attacks/ foraging bout) than conspecifics from rural environments. Consequently, the energy expended to capture prey was higher for common noctules in urban than in rural environments. In line with our prediction, urban bats relied less on group hunting, likely because group hunting was unnecessary in an environment where the spatial distribution of prey insects is predictable, for example, in parks or around floodlights. While acknowledging the limitations of a small sample size and low number of spatial replicates, our study suggests that scarce food resources may make urban habitats unfavorable for large bat species with higher energy requirements compared to smaller bat species. In conclusion, a lower food intake may displace larger species from urban areas making habitats with high insect biomass production key for protecting large bat species in urban environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Urbanization is a major contributor to the loss of biodiversity. Its rapid progress is mostly at the expense of natural ecosystems and the species inhabiting them. While some species can adjust quickly and thrive in cities, many others cannot. To support biodiversity conservation and guide management decisions in urban areas, it is important to find robust methods to estimate the urban affinity of species (i.e. their tendency to live in urban areas) and understand how it is associated with their traits. Since previous studies mainly relied on discrete classifications of species' urban affinity, often involving inconsistent assessments or variable parameters, their results were difficult to compare. To address this issue, we developed and evaluated a set of continuous indices that quantify species' urban affinity based on publicly available occurrence data. We investigated the extent to which a species' position along the urban affinity gradient depends on the chosen index and how this choice affects inferences about the relationship between urban affinity and a set of morphological, sensory and functional traits. While these indices are applicable to a wide range of taxonomic groups, we examined their performance using a global set of 356 bat species. As bats vary in sensitivity to anthropogenic disturbances, they provide an interesting case study. We found that different types of indices resulted in different rankings of species on the urban affinity spectrum, but this had little effect on the association of traits with urban affinity. Our results suggest that bat species predisposed to urban life are characterized by low echolocation call frequencies, relatively long call durations, small body size and flexibility in the selection of the roost type. We conclude that simple indices are appropriate and practical, and propose to apply them to more taxa to improve our understanding of how urbanization favours or filters species with particular traits.",

            "abstractNote": "The bat fauna of Australia comprises some 25% of all terrestrial species, yet we know very little of the demography, dispersal, and movement dynamics of most bat species. The Pilbara leaf-nosed bat (Rhinonicteris aurantia Pilbara form) is a threatened microbat that roosts exclusively in caves that occur in mineral rich deposits in the Pilbara region. Due to their specific roost microclimate requirements these bats cannot survive for long without a suitable roost and are sensitive to roost disturbance. Understanding the connectivity of roosts throughout the Pilbara is crucial for informed decisions to mitigate potential impacts to persistence of this species in areas under economic development. Along with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers, we used reduced representation genomic sequencing of over 150 individuals from eight roost sites throughout the Pilbara and tested for landscape-scale population differentiation associated with the two major subregions — the Hamersley and Chichester, as well as finer-scale among roost variation. We found evidence of high rates of dispersal and low population structure within the Pilbara, indi­ cating one panmictic population, with mtDNA results suggesting evidence of some female phil­ opatry. Our results highlight the ongoing need for detailed genetic studies to provide critical insight to species dispersal, particularly in multi-use landscapes. We discuss the importance of identifying and retaining connectivity of key habitat to maintain genetic diversity and gene flow throughout panmictic populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Pituitary prolactin (PRL) shows an episodic pattern of evolution in mammals, with a slow underlying rate (near stasis) and periods of rapid change in some groups. PRL evolution in bats, the second most speciose mammalian order, has not previously been studied, and is examined here. Slow basal evolution of PRL is seen in some bats, particularly megabats, but in most microbat groups evolution of PRL is more rapid. Accelerated evolution of PRL is particularly notable in the family Vespertilionidae, where analysis of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicates that it reflects adaptive evolution/positive selection. Remarkably, vespertilionid bats also show a large sequence insertion, of variable length, into exon 4 of PRL, giving a protein sequence 18–60 amino acids longer than normal, with the longest insertions in bats of the genus Myotis. An equivalent insertion has not been reported in PRL of any other vertebrate group. In the 3-dimensional structure of the complex between PRL and the extracellular domain (ecd) of its receptor (PRL:PRLR2) the inserted sequence is seen to be introduced in the short loop between helices 2 and 3 of PRL; it is far removed from the receptor-binding sites, and may not interfere with binding. The ecd of the receptor also shows variable rates of evolution, with a higher rate in the Vespertilionidae, but this is much less marked than for the hormone. The distribution of substitutions introduced into PRL during vespertilionid evolution appears to be non-random, and this and the evidence for positive selection suggests that the rapid evolution and insert sequence introduction were associated with a significant change in the biological properties of the hormone.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: In the past two decades, bats have emerged as an important model system to study host-pathogen interactions. More recently, it has been shown that bats may also serve as a new and excellent model to study aging, inflammation, and cancer, among other important biological processes. The cave nectar bat or lesser dawn bat (Eonycteris spelaea) is known to be a reservoir for several viruses and intracellular bacteria. It is widely distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics from India to Southeast Asia and pollinates several plant species, including the culturally and economically important durian in the region. Here, we report the whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing, followed by subsequent de novo assembly, of the E. spelaea genome solely using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) long-read sequencing platform. Findings: The newly assembled E. spelaea genome is 1.97 Gb in length and consists of 4,470 sequences with a contig N50 of 8.0 Mb. Identified repeat elements covered 34.65% of the genome, and 20,640 unique protein-coding genes with 39,526 transcripts were annotated. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the PacBio long-read sequencing platform alone is sufficient to generate a comprehensive de novo assembled genome and transcriptome of an important bat species. These results will provide useful insights and act as a resource to expand our understanding of bat evolution, ecology, physiology, immunology, viral infection, and transmission dynamics.",

Between species, the number of intact receptors can vary by orders of magnitude. However, the evolutionary processes behind variation in receptor number, and its link to ﬁtness-related behaviors are not well understood. From vomeronasal transcriptomes, we discovered the ﬁrst evidence of intact vomeronasal type-1 receptor (V1r) genes in bats, and we tested whether putatively functional bat receptors were orthologous to those of related taxa, or whether bats have evolved novel receptors. Instead of lineage-speciﬁc duplications, we found that bat V1rs show high levels of orthology to those of their relatives, and receptors are under comparative levels of purifying selection as non-bats. Despite widespread vomeronasal organ loss in bats, V1r copies have been retained for >65 million years. The highly conserved nature of bat V1rs challenges our current understanding of mammalian V1r function and suggests roles other than conspeciﬁc recognition or mating initiation in social behavior.",

            "abstractNote": "Mammalian growth hormone (GH) sequences have been shown previously to display episodic evolution: the sequence is generally strongly conserved but on at least two occasions during mammalian evolution (on lineages leading to higher primates and ruminants) bursts of rapid evolution occurred. However, the number of mammalian orders studied previously has been relatively limited, and the availability of sequence data via mammalian genome projects provides the potential for extending the range of GH gene sequences examined. Complete or nearly complete GH gene sequences for six mammalian species for which no data were previously available have been extracted from the genome databases—Dasypus novemcinctus (nine-banded armadillo), Erinaceus europaeus (western European hedgehog), Myotis lucifugus (little brown bat), Procavia capensis (cape rock hyrax), Sorex araneus (European shrew), Spermophilus tridecemlineatus (13-lined ground squirrel). In addition incomplete data for several other species have been extended. Examination of the data in detail and comparison with previously available sequences has allowed assessment of the reliability of deduced sequences. Several of the new sequences diﬀer substantially from the consensus sequence previously determined for eutherian GHs, indicating greater variability than previously recognised, and conﬁrming the episodic pattern of evolution. The episodic pattern is not seen for signal sequences, 50 upstream sequence or synonymous substitutions—it is speciﬁc to the mature protein sequence, suggesting that it relates to the hormonal function. The substitutions accumulated during the course of GH evolution have occurred mainly on the side of the hormone facing away from the receptor, in a non-random fashion, and it is suggested that this may reﬂect interaction of the receptor–bound hormone with other proteins or small ligands.",

            "abstractNote": "Mammalian olfactory receptor genes (ORs) are a diverse family of genes encoding proteins that directly interact with environmental chemical cues. ORs evolve via gene duplication in a birth-death fashion, neofunctionalizing and pseudogenizing over time. Olfaction is a primary sense used for food detection in plant-visiting bats, but the relationship between dietary specialization and OR repertoire diversity is unclear. Within neotropical Leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae), many lineages are plant specialists, and some have a distinct OR repertoire compared to insectivorous species. Yet, whether specialization on particular plant genera is associated with the evolution of specialized, less diverse OR repertoires has never been tested. Using targeted sequence capture, we sequenced the OR repertoires of three sympatric species of short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia), which vary in their degree of specialization on the fruits of Piper plants. We characterized orthologous vs duplicated receptors among Carollia species, and explored the diversity and redundancy of the receptor gene repertoire. At the species level, the most dedicated Piper specialist, Carollia castanea, had lower OR diversity compared to the two generalists (C. sowelli and C. perspicillata), but we discovered a few unique sets of ORs within C. castanea with high redundancy of similar gene duplicates. These unique receptors potentially enable C. castanea to detect Piper fruit odorants better than its two congeners. Carollia perspicillata, the species with the most generalist diet, had a higher diversity of intact receptors, suggesting the ability to detect a wider range of odorant molecules. Variation among ORs may be a factor in the coexistence of these sympatric species, facilitating the exploitation of different plant resources. Our study sheds light on how gene duplication and changes in OR diversity may play a role in dietary adaptations and underlie ecological interactions between bats and plants.",

            "abstractNote": "The Honduran white bat, Ectophylla alba (Allen 1982), is one of eight species belonging to the family Phyllos­ tomidae that exclusively roosts in tents. Due to its restricted distribution, habitat specificity, and diet re­ quirements, E. alba has been strongly affected by habitat loss and fragmentation during the last decade. In this study, we developed the first genomic resource for this species; we assembled and analyzed in detail the complete mitochondrial genome of E. alba. The mitogenome of E. alba is 16,664 bp in length and is comprised of 13 protein coding genes (PCGs), 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and a putative Control Region (CR) 1,232 bp in length. Gene arrangement in the mitochondrial chromosome of E. alba is identical to that reported before in other species of co-familiar bats. All PCGs are under purifying selection, with atp8 experiencing the least selective pressure. In all PCGs, codons ending with adenine are preferred over others ending in thymine and cytosine. Except tRNA-Serine 1, all tRNAs exhibit a cloverleaf secondary structure. The CR of E. alba exhibits three domains commonly described in other mammals, including bats; extended terminal associated sequences (ETAS), central, and conserved sequence block (CSB). A ML phylogenetic reconstruction of the family Phyllos­ tomidae based on all 13 mitochondrial PCGs confirms the monophyletic status of the subfamily Sternoderma­ tinae and indicates the close relationship between E. alba and the genus Artibeus. This is the first genomic resource developed for E. alba and represents the first step to improving our understanding of the genomic underpinnings involved in the evolution of specialization as well as acclimatization and adaptation to local and global change of specialist bats.",
