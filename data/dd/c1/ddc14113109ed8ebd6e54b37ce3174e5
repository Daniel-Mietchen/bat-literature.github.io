The objective of this study was to characterize the species assemblage, genetic diversity, and host specificity of bat flies (Nycteribiidae, Diptera) and wing mites (Spinturnicidae, Acari) found on these bat hosts in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Notably, while bat flies lay puparia on the cave walls and can thus be transmitted indirectly, wing mites require direct body contact for transmission. Morphological identification and sequencing of a 710-bp fragment of cytochrome oxidase I gene of 207 bat flies yielded 4 species, 3 on M. schreibersii and 1 on R. ferrumequinum. Sequencing of a 460-bp small subunit ribosomal RNA fragment, in all 190 collected wing mites revealed 2 species, 1 per host. In no case was a parasite associated with 1 host found on the other host. Species and genetic diversity of flies were higher in M. schreibersii, likely reflecting their host’s larger colony sizes and migratory potential. Mite species of both hosts showed similarly low diversity, likely due to their faster life history and lower winter survival. Our findings highlight a remarkably high host-specificity and segregation of ectoparasite species despite direct contact among their hosts in the roost, suggesting a defined host preference in the investigated ectoparasite species. Furthermore, the differences in ectoparasite genetic diversity exemplify the interplay between host and parasite life histories in shaping parasite population genetic structure.",

This study evaluated the trophic relations among three species of Carollia in a premontane forest of central Peru. To accomplish this, we first determined the diet composition of frugivorous bats to build a bat–fruit interaction network. We then assessed the trophic structure of the bat assemblage using a modularity analysis in the network. Carollia brevicauda and Carollia perspicillata were grouped apart from Carollia benkeithi. This partition occurred because the diet of C. benkeithi was more specialized, characterized by two Piper species, a Cyclanthaceae species, and Banara guianensis. Moreover, C. benkeithi, in contrast to its congeners, did not consume fruits of Ficus or Cecropia (canopy resources). This result and available information on the ecology of Carollia species suggest that small species of Carollia are more likely to carry out most of their feeding activities in the understory than are large species of the genus.",

            "abstractNote": "Excessive sugar consumption could lead to high blood glucose levels that are harmful to mammalian health and life. Despite consuming large amounts of sugar-­rich food, fruit bats have a longer lifespan, raising the question of how these bats overcome ­potential hyperglycemia. We investigated the change of blood glucose level in nectar-­ feeding bats (Eonycteris spelaea) and fruit-­eating bats (Cynopterus sphinx) via adjusting their sugar intake and time of flight. We found that the maximum blood glucose level of C. sphinx was higher than 24 mmol/L that is considered to be pathological in other mammals. After C. sphinx bats spent approximately 75% of their time to fly, their blood glucose levels dropped markedly, and the blood glucose of E. spelaea fell to the fast levels after they spent 70% time of fly. Thus, the level of blood glucose elevated with the quantity of sugar intake but declined with the time of flight. Our results indicate that high-­intensive flight is a key regulator for blood glucose homeostasis during foraging. High-­intensive flight may confer benefits to the fruit bats in foraging success and behavioral interactions and increases the efficiency of pollen and seed disposal mediated by bats.",

Stereoscopic photographs were taken, both by reflected and by transmitted light, and measurements of best gliding angle were made. Variation of wing span and area at different speeds was much less than in birds. This is attributed to the construction of the wing, which prevents the bat from folding back the manus in flight, because this would lead to collapse of the plagiopatagium. The trailing edge of the wing is normally deflected upwards in flight, at least in the distal parts. This is interpreted as providing longitudinal stability. The plagiopatagialis proprii muscles appear to act as an elevator, by deflecting the trailing edge of the plagiopatagium upwards. The speed range over which the bat could glide was 5·3–11·0 m/s. Its maximum lift coefficient was 1-5, and its best glide ratio 6·8:1. The Reynolds number range, based on mean chord, was 3·26 × 104 to 6·79 × 104. A simple regression analysis of the glide polar indicated a very high span efficiency factor (k) and low wing profile drag coefficient (Cdp). On the other hand, a drag analysis on the assumption that k = 1 leads to an improbably large increase in the estimated Cdpat low speeds. It is suggested that the correct interpretation probably lies between these extremes, with k ≈ 1·5; Cdp would then be about 0·02 at high speeds, rising to somewhat over o-i at the minimum speed. It would appear that the bat is not so good as a pigeon at fast gliding, but better at low-speed manoeuvring. On most points of performance, however, the two are remarkably similar.",

Our objectives were to examine natural Eptesicus fuscus gammaherpesvirus (EfHV) infections in their host, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), and determine whether infection is associated with disease. In tissue samples from 132 individual big brown bats, EfHV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 41 bats. Tissues from 59 of these cases, including 17 from bats with detectable EfHV genomes, were analyzed. An EfHV isolate was obtained from one of the cases, and electron micrographs and whole genome sequencing were used to confirm that this was a unique isolate of EfHV. Although several bats exhibited various lesions, we did not establish EfHV infection as a cause. Latent infection, defined as RNAScope probe binding to viral latency-associated nuclear antigen in the absence of viral envelope glycoprotein probe binding, was found within cells of the lymphoid tissues. These cells also had colocalization of the B-cell probe targeting CD20 mRNA. Probe binding for both latency-associated nuclear antigen and a viral glycoprotein was observed in individual cells dispersed throughout the alveolar capillaries of the lung, which had characteristics of pulmonary intravascular macrophages. Cells with a similar distribution in bat lungs expressed major histocompatibility class II, a marker for antigen presenting cells, and the existence of pulmonary intravascular macrophages in bats was confirmed with transmission electron microscopy. The importance of this cell type in γHVs infections warrants further investigation.",

We tested the hypothesis that the young bats are able to improve the ability of hunting by trial and error. An additional hypothesis was that their rate of prey consumption and method of handling prey improve with age. We separated the juveniles from their mothers and observed them individually at different ages. At 58 d of age, M. lyra roosted 2 m above ﬂoor level, ﬂew down only towards moving frogs, landed >1 m away from them and returned to roosts without showing attempt to capture. At day 60, bats roosted at 50-cm heights, landed approx. 1 m away from frogs and moved towards them. Although bats intercepted frogs, their attempts to capture were still unsuccessful. At day 62, bats landed <1 m from frogs, made similar attempts and most of them were successful. Bats carried frogs, roosted at heights of 100 cm and started consuming. Numbers of jumps made by frogs and attempts made by bats during successful captures decreased with increase in age of bats. Furthermore, the distance between landing sites of bats and places where frogs stayed during landings decreased with advancement of age. Until 75 d of age, M. lyra devoured frogs with legs-ﬁrst on signiﬁcantly more occasions. After 75 d, most of the consumptions started with heads of frogs, similar to adults. Duration of feeding on single frogs was signiﬁcantly longer compared with that of mothers until young were 75-d old. The study revealed that juveniles were inefﬁcient on localization, rate of consumption, and handling prey at earlier ages (e.g. 60 d). They became efﬁcient on these behavioural components at later age, i.e. after 75 d. Thus, the results were in accordance with both the hypotheses. Bats did not respond to stationary frogs.",

Here we provide evidence on the consumption of leaves by Carollia perspicillata in northeastern Brazil, through records of its feeding behavior using camera traps, during the monitoring of the Gruta da Janela cave. The analysis of 12 months of monitoring revealed folivory in 7 months. Extra footage (1-min samples) allowed us to confirm C. perspicillata consuming the whole leaf (juices and fibers), which was never recorded in Neotropical bats. The record provides new insights into the diet of C. perspicillata, with an important new perspective on the feeding ecology of the species. We also highlight the use of camera traps as an important tool to monitor bat c­ olonies in permanent shelters.",

            "abstractNote": "Seasonal variations in the diet composition and prey selection by Myotis myotis were studied in a Mediterranean region dominated by open stone oak woodlands, olive groves, and cereal steppes. The diet and food abundance were determined by faecal analysis and pitfall trapping, respectively. Overall, the diet (expressed as % frequency) was dominated by carabid beetles (Carabidae, 52%), crickets (Gryllidae, 43%), and spiders (Arachnida, 34%). Food was far more abundant in the spring than in the summer and autumn. The dietary composition varied significantly throughout the year. In the spring, it was dominated by carabids and crickets, and in the summer by spiders. These were then replaced by carabids, which became the most frequently eaten prey in autumn. The spring-summer switch to spiders coincided with a marked drop in food abundance. Some of the temporal variations in bats’ diet can be explained by parallel changes in prey abundance. In comparison to central European populations, our Mediterranean colony of M. myotis consumed much more crickets and spiders, which was balanced with a lower use of carabid beetles. Prey selection was tested using logistic regression models. The results suggest that, although carabids are the most consumed, crickets are preferred. Spiders seem to represent mostly a complement preyed upon at times of lower food abundance. It is not clear if the preference for crickets is simply due to their great conspicuousness, or to the choice based on energetic rewards or taste. Overall, our results are consistent with the predictions of the optimal foraging theory.",

Sex differences in parasite load have been documented in many mammals, and have been attributed either to the allocation of energy to growth rather than the immune system in mammals exhibiting male-biased sexual size dimorphism or to the immunosuppressive qualities of testosterone. In addition, ectoparasites can have negative effects on body size and condition, as energy is allocated to the immune system rather than to growth and maintenance. Here, we used the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus (Shaw, 1801)) and its ectoparasites to test two predictions: (1) males are more heavily parasitized than females and (2) individuals with high ectoparasite loads will be in poorer condition and be smaller than individuals with low ectoparasite loads. Males were significantly more parasitized than females, and there was a nonsignificant trend for small males to be more parasitized than large males. Because the northern flying squirrel is not sexually dimorphic, the immunosuppressive qualities of testosterone may explain the sex differences in ectoparasite load. Ectoparasites may also influence skeletal growth rates, and males that are more susceptible to ectoparasites may simply be unable to allocate as much energy to growth and are thus structurally smaller.",

This study investigated the light microscopic morphology, morphometry and histochemistry of the skin and its glands across the cheek, withers, croup, ventral abdomen, perianal region, wing membrane, intercrural membrane and foot pad of the species. Sweat glands were absent and hypodermis was observed only in the withers, croup and ventral abdomen. The croup had the highest density of hair follicles while the perianal region had the highest density of sebaceous gland acini. The thicknesses of the dermis and epidermis were significantly high in the withers and foot pad respectively. Hair follicles and sebaceous glands were absent in the wing membrane. The sebaceous glands had melanin pigmentation at the periphery and stained positive to Alcian Blue-periodic acid Schiff at the withers and ventral abdomen. Epidermal and dermal thicknesses reported in this study were generally higher than those of Yangochiroptera bats and the presence of sebaceous glands and hair follicles in the wing membrane were variable in different bat species. This study has provided baseline information on the light microscopic morphology and morphometry of the skin and its glands across the various body regions in the African straw-coloured fruit bat. This information would be helpful in the understanding, handling, skin disease treatment and management of the bat in captivity for biomedical research purposes.",

Both the new and the original specimens were taken along the junction of the so-called \"high forest\" and \"Guinea forest\" zones but some 1200 miles apart. The Cameroun specimens were compared with the original type series and additional morphological data provided as well as the illustrations of facial and cranial features. T. bivittata, of similar size, is shown not to be closely allied with T. russata nor any member of the subgenus Chaerephon. T. russata is closely related to T. aloysiisabaudiae but differs in size, skull proportions, and details of the basisphenoid pits.",

These New World bats prey on mammals and create significant economic impacts through transmission of rabies in areas where livestock are prevalent. Furthermore, in some portions of their range, it is not uncommon for them to prey upon humans. It is critical to the management of this species and for understanding the spread of bat rabies that detailed studies of D. rotundus population structure be conducted. To further such studies, we have characterized 12 microsatellite loci for this species.",

One of the most genetically divergent Lyssavirus spp. has been detected in a dead Miniopterus schreibersii bat in France. Brain samples were found positive for the presence of antigen, infectious virus and viral RNA by classical virological methods and molecular methods respectively. The complete genome sequence was determined by next‐generation sequencing. The analysis of the complete genome sequence confirmed the presence of Lleida bat lyssavirus (LLEBV) in bats in France with 99.7% of nucleotide identity with the Spanish LLEBV strain (KY006983).",

            "abstractNote": "Although closely related host species are similarly susceptible to infestations of parasites, even small differences in their morphology, feeding behaviour or population history may affect parasitic infestation. In the present study we analyse the abundance of two species of nycteribiid flies (Diptera, Nycteribiidae) and one wing mite (Mesostigmata: Spinturnicidae) infesting populations of Miniopterus schreibersii and M. pallidius, which comprise a cryptic species complex of Miniopterus species in Asia Minor. We focus on the putative contact zone between these two taxa in Central Anatolia. We conducted our study in seven caves with large (≥ 1,000 individuals) maternity aggregations: three housing Anatolian M. schreibersii, one housing Levantine M. schreibersii, and three housing Anatolian M. pallidus. Sex-biased parasitism was found only twice: female-biased in Spinturnix psi on M. pallidus, and male-biased in Nycteribia schmidlii on M. schreibersii. Differences in the flies’ abundance between Anatolian M. schreibersii and M. pallidius were found only in N. schmidlii (for female host), but not for Penicilidia dufourii. There was a significant difference in the wing mite abundance, both between hosts and sexes. Unexpectedly, we observed a large difference in the load and type of parasites between M. schreibersii from Levant (separated from other M. schreibersii colonies by a few colonies of M. pallidus) and the rest of M. schreibersii. In Levant, the wing mites did not infest bats. Instead, they carried almost threefold larger load of the flies than in other bent-wing bat colonies. It is possible that the decline of wing mites is associated with increasing quantities of flies. One hypothesis regarding the absence of S. psi in the Levant colony, is that it is correlated with a significant decrease in the size of the bat’s population in the past (as indicated by both mtDNA and microsatellite studies) and their disconnection from the continuous range of other M. schreibersii. We did not find any correlation between parasite load and health status of the host.",

We collected faecal and ejecta samples under day roosts and at nocturnal feeding trees. Eidolon dupreanum ate mainly fruit, although Eucalyptus spp. ﬂowers were also consumed. In total, 30 plant species (fourteen identiﬁed and sixteen unidentiﬁed) were recorded in the diet, including six introduced taxa. Polyscias spp. trees, which occurred in humid forest at least 5 km from the roost, were the most frequently recorded plant in the diet. Fruits of Psidium spp. were abundant near to the roost but relatively uncommon in the faeces. Passage through the alimentary canal was limited to seeds >7 mm and there was some evidence for a positive effect on germination after passage through bats’ stomachs. The role of fruit bats as seed dispersers in forest ecosystems in Madagascar should be used as an additional leverage for their conservation.",

Thus, this study aimed to analyze and compare the composition, anatomy, and histology of male RAGs of bat species belonging to three of the largest (cosmopolitan) bat families: Vespertilionidae (Histiotus velatus), Molossidae (Molossus rufus), and Emballonuridae (Peropteryx leucoptera), in order to understand the variations in the bat RAGs. The results showed that the RAGs of H. velatus, M. rufus, and P. leucoptera are composed of an intra-abdominal prostatic complex, associated with the urethra, urethral glands, and a pair of inguinal bulbourethral glands; without ampullary glands or seminal vesicles. The prostatic complex can be composed of two (M. rufus and P. leucoptera) or three (H. velatus) prostatic regions, and can be compact (P. leucoptera), semi-lobed (M. rufus), or multilobed (H. velatus). Each prostatic region has unique and distinct characteristics, with the ventral region presenting a holocrine nature, exclusive to bats; while the dorsal and/or dorsolateral regions have similar characteristics to the ventral prostate of rats and to the human peripheral zone.",

Differences in the agglutination profiles were detected between epimastigotes or trypomastigotes from the two parasite populations using lectins with specificity for D-GlcNAc, D-GalNAc, D-Gal and D-Man as probe. Major variation w as observed between epimastigote forms. Additionally, the D -GlcNAc binding lectins W G A and BS II strongly interacted with the trypomastigote from both M 5 and M 2 9 stocks; this fact is evidence that these trypanosomes are distinct from Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi.",

These are basic questions about the biology of a species, which bring key information for application in conservation and management. Unfortunately, this information is available for only a minimum fraction of all animal species. Using 1) ecological niche modeling with maximum entropy (Maxent), 2) relative abundance estimates using museum records, and 3) field surveys of roosting sites, we report the fraternal fruit-eating bat, Artibeus fraterculus, as having a distribution limited to the Tumbesian ecoregion in Ecuador and west central Peru, being the relatively most abundant bat species throughout its range, with healthy populations which are primarily sustained by cultivated and introduced plants, and using human-made constructions as roost sites. Additionally, we described a large congregation of individuals of this species in a single roost, representing the largest colony reported for the genus Artibeus. These results may indicate resilience of A. fraterculus to human disturbance.",

Recent evidence from humans and other mammals suggests that sugar-rich diets of floral nectar and ripe fruit have favoured mutations in, and functional preservation of, the\n              ADH7\n              gene, which encodes the ADH class 4 enzyme responsible for metabolizing ethanol. Here we interrogate a large, comparative dataset of\n              ADH7\n              gene sequence variation, including that underlying the amino acid residue located at the key site (294) that regulates the affinity of ADH7 for ethanol. Our analyses span 171 mammal species, including 59 newly sequenced. We report extensive variation, especially among frugivorous and nectarivorous bats, with potential for functional impact. We also report widespread variation in the retention and probable pseudogenization of\n              ADH7\n              . However, we find little statistical evidence of an overarching impact of dietary behaviour on putative\n              ADH7\n              function or presence of derived alleles at site 294 across mammals, which suggests that the evolution of\n              ADH7\n              is shaped by complex factors. Our study reports extensive new diversity in a gene of longstanding ecological interest, offers new sources of variation to be explored in functional assays in future study, and advances our understanding of the processes of molecular evolution.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Prosimian lemurs differ fundamentally from anthropoid primates in many traits related to social structure. By exploring the demography of Milne‐Edwards' sifakas (\n              Propithecus diadema edwardsi\n              ), and comparing it to other well‐studied primates, we explore the effect of demographic and life‐history factors on social structure. Specifically, we compare lemur survivorship and fertility patterns to two published composite models: one created for New World and another created for Old World monkeys. Using longitudinal data collected on individual\n              Propithecus diadema edwardsi\n              from four study groups from 1986–2000 in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, we quantify 1) group composition, 2) birth seasonality, 3) interbirth interval, 4) life‐table values, and 5) population growth estimates. The mortality, survivorship, and life‐expectancy schedules indicate high infant and juvenile mortality. Fertility remains high until death. The intrinsic rate of increase and net reproductive rate indicate a shrinking population. We suggest that high mortality rather than low fertility causes the observed population decline. While sifaka survivorship closely resembles New World patterns, fertility resembles Old World patterns, i.e., like New World monkeys, few sifakas survive to reproductive age, and those that do, reproduce at a slow rate resembling the Old World pattern. This necessarily impacts social structure. An adult sifaka at the end of her lifespan will have one only daughter who survives to reproductive age, compared to 3.4 for New World or 2.7 for Old World monkeys. Demography limits the formation of large kin‐based groups for sifakas, and survivorship and fertility patterns do not easily permit sifakas to form large same‐sex family groups.

During the summers of 2003-2004 and 2007-2008 we trapped bats in mist nets set at a bridge over the Mersey River in Kejimkujik National Park. In total we captured 42 tricolored bats (41 female and 1 male) and fitted 32 females and the single male with radio transmitters and tracked them to their roost sites daily. Characteristics of roost sites were compared to those of randomly selected, potentially available roost sites using an a priori–selected candidate set of models and ranked using AICc for model selection. In total we found 99 unique roost trees in 9 spatially distinct (8 female, 1 male) roosting areas. On average, bats spent 2.5 d in a roost tree. While conspecifics from other parts of the species’ range typically roost in tree foliage, maternity colonies of tricolored bats in Nova Scotia roosted exclusively in Usnea trichodea lichen, typically in conifers (of which 91% were spruce; Picea spp.) that were on average 212 m from water. Only 4% of the 300 random trees from the landscape contained Usnea trichodea. These trees were a mixture of softwood and hardwood (58% and 42%, respectively) and were, on average, 550 m from water. These findings represent an apparently unique relationship between lichens and bats that likely impacts many aspects of the species biology, including distribution, social structure, and parasite prevalence.",

            "abstractNote": "How teeth are replaced during normal growth and development has long been an important question for comparative and developmental anatomy. Non-standard model animals have become increasingly popular in this ﬁeld due to the fact that the canonical model laboratory mammal, the mouse, develops only one generation of teeth (monophyodonty), whereas the majority of mammals possess two generations of teeth (diphyodonty). Here we used the straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), an Old World megabat, which has two generations of teeth, in order to observe the development and replacement of tooth germs from initiation up to mineralization stages. Our morphological study uses 3D reconstruction of histological sections to uncover differing arrangements of the ﬁrst and second-generation tooth germs during the process of tooth replacement. We show that both tooth germ generations develop as part of the dental lamina, with the ﬁrst generation detaching from the lamina, leaving the free edge to give rise to a second generation. This separation was particularly marked at the third premolar locus, where the primary and replacement teeth become positioned side by side, unconnected by a lamina. The position of the replacement tooth, with respect to the primary tooth, varied within the mouth, with replacements forming posterior to or directly lingual to the primary tooth. Development of replacement teeth was arrested at some tooth positions and this appeared to be linked to the timing of tooth initiation and the subsequent rate of development. This study adds an additional species to the growing body of non-model species used in the study of tooth replacement, and offers a new insight into the development of the diphyodont condition.",

To explore the potential for social factors to modulate reproductive seasonality, the in¯uence of social and environmental cues on birth timing was examined in greater spear-nosed bats Phyllostomus hastatus. Births were observed or dated from pup growth curves in three caves on Trinidad, West Indies, over 4 years. Nearly 40% of the variability in birth dates could be explained by environmental factors because birth dates differed signi®cantly between years and showed consistent differences between locations that receive differing rainfall amounts. Nevertheless, the timing of births within caves and in captivity indicated that social cues also affect the timing and synchrony of births within female social groups. Within each cave, social groups differed signi®cantly in mean birth dates. Two groups of greater spear-nosed bats brought into captivity and maintained without seasonal cues initially exhibited less birth synchrony than wild groups, but birth synchrony did not decline over 3 subsequent years. Further evidence for the in¯uence of social cues on reproductive timing came from four females that were transferred between the captive groups and then gave birth in synchrony with their new group and out of schedule with their original group. Social cues in¯uencing reproductive timing are unlikely to be volatile chemicals or other passively transferred cues, given that frequent prolonged physical contact did not increase birth synchrony between adjacent wild groups. Cues are more probably transferred actively between female group members, perhaps by grooming, or through mating with one attendant male.",

            "abstractNote": "The coexistence in one area of two species with similar ecological requirements can lead to their morphological convergence or divergence. Convergence may be the result of adaptation to new conditions (species share a niche), whereas divergence may be the effect of competition for a resource (species compete for a niche). Compatibility with Bergmann’s rule is possible in species with a signiﬁcant latitudinal range. We tested whether potential differences between two long-eared bat species are consistent with character displacement or Bergmann’s rule by investigating variability in cranial morphology of Plecotus auritus and P. austriacus, which commonly occur in Central and Eastern Europe. We used 111 complete specimens from the allopatric range of P. auritus (nine localities) and sympatric P. auritus and P. austriacus (44 localities) from Poland and Ukraine. A traditional morphometric method was used to evaluate variation in cranial size between the species in their ranges. Discriminant function analysis of cranial dimensions showed larger differences between sympatric populations of P. austriacus and P. auritus than between allopatric P. auritus and a sympatric population of P. austriacus. A subsequent analysis showed that most cranial variables (excluding elements of the skull responsible for prey capture and elements partly associated with echolocation) from the sympatric population of P. auritus are smaller than those homologues from allopatric populations. Larger individuals from the allopatric population originate from the northern part of the study area; however, we did not detect an association of cranial variability with latitude pattern. The variation in size of the cranium between individuals from allopatric and sympatric ranges of P. auritus can be explained by different preferences in each range for prey that vary in hardness. P. auritus consumed signiﬁcantly more hard-bodied insects in allopatry than in sympatry. This example is one of few conﬁrmed morphological cases of competitive character displacement.",

The overall A + T content of the H-strand is 61.4% (A 32.0%, T 29.4%, C 24.1% and G 14.5%). Among the 13 protein-coding genes, most of them begin with ATG as the start codon except for ND5 with ATA and ND2 and ND3 with ATT. ND1 and ND2 genes terminate with TAG as the stop codon, Cyt b ends with AGA, COIII, ND3 and ND4 genes end with an incomplete stop codon (T– –) and the other protein-coding genes end with TAA. In Bayesian inference (BI) and Maximum likelihood (ML) trees, we found that N. noctula is a sister clade to Pipistrellus abramus, and (Nyctalus + Pipistrellus) is a sister clade to (Chalinolobus + (Eptesicus + Vespertilio)) (1.00 in BI and 100% in ML).",

However, few studies have shown this relationship under conditions of natural pollination. Using the tropical dry forest tree\n              Pachira quinata\n              , we evaluated the relationship between the number of microgametophytes per pistil and the number of sires with respect to the production of fruits and seeds in a natural population of\n              Pachira quinata.\n              Our study demonstrates that fruit and seed production are directly related to the number of microgametophytes per pistil in natural populations of\n              P. quinata.\n              Only 6% of the marked flowers developed into mature fruits and 10% of the marked flowers initiated fruits but later aborted them. A mean of 23 pollen grains were required to produce a seed. Flowers with >400 pollen grains on the stigma always developed into mature fruits, whereas flowers that received <200 grains never matured fruits. Half of the pollen grains transferred to a flower stigma germinated and developed pollen tubes to the base of the style. The number of pollen grains on a stigma explained 34% of the variation in seed number per fruit, and the number of seeds produced per fruit is positively correlated with the size of the seeds. The population of\n              P. quinata\n              studied is predominantly outcrossing, and seeds within fruits are sired by one or a few donors. The total seed crop within trees was sired by three to five donors. Our study examined the implications of the variation in size of microgametophyte loads per pistil with respect to the breeding system and the paternity of progeny under natural conditions. The competitive ability of pollen and pollen tube attrition are important factors regulating fruit production in\n              P. quinata.",

            "abstractNote": "Dedicated nectarivory is a derived feeding habit that requires specialized cranial and soft-tissue morphologies to extract nectar from flowers. Nectarivory has evolved many times in terrestrial vertebrates, and in four bat families (Pteropodidae, Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae, and Mystacinidae). Within phyllostomids, specializations to nectarivory have been well documented in two subfamilies, Glossophaginae and Lonchophyllinae. However, nectarivory has also evolved independently in the genus Phyllostomus (subfamily Phyllostominae). Since Phyllostomus species have an omnivorous diet with a high consumption of nectar, they can be used to explore the basic morphological modifications linked to evolving a nectarivorous habit. Here, we focused on describing and comparing the morphological features potentially associated with nectarivory in Phyllostomus discolor. We present the first detailed tongue and palate morphological descriptions for P. discolor and perform skull morphometric analysis including 10 species. We found hair-like papillae on the tongue of P. discolor, a convergent feature with Glossophaginae and nectarivorous Pteropodids; these papillae likely confer an advantage when feeding on nectar. P. discolor does not show skull morphological features characteristic of nectarivorous bats, such as a long and narrow snout. We pose that the consumption of a variety of food, such as hard insects and fruits, and the large size of P. discolor relative to specialized nectarivores may create trade-offs against morphological specialization of the skull towards nectarivory. In contrast, a long and mobile tongue with hair-like papillae may be an evolutionary solution for nectar extraction that does not have a major impact on this species' ability to feed on other resources.",

Of the many possible hypothetical relationships, the most parsimonious tree showed three homoplasies and allowed the genus Gerbillurus to be paraphyletic. The alternative trees, depicting larger number of homoplasies but with homoplasies restricted to fusion or fission events, were compatible with the morphological data in supporting the monophyly of Gerbillurus. To choose between the hypothesis based on the most parsimonious chromosomal tree and those supported by both morphology and slightly less parsimonious chromosomal trees, we performed an electrophoretic study on this group of gerbils. The conclusions are that the genus Gerbillurus is monophyletic and represents a branch that is closely related to the T. robusta group of Taterillini. The study documents that fissions and fusions must have occurred frequently and that in some cases the same fusions were acquired in two independent lineages in numbers exceeding those that are predicted by strict parsimony. The results raise questions about the validity of systematic conclusions based solely on fusion/fission data and utilizing the parsimony criterion.",

A number of qualitative characters that could not be adequately quantified for statistical analysis also have been studied. Miniopterus robustior from the Loyalty Islands, the smallest member of the tristis group, is regarded as a possible ancestral prototype for the species group. Populations from the islands east of New Guinea, from Papua, and from West Irian are described as three distinct geographic races of a new species. Specimens from Sulawesi (Celebes) are described as a large race of M. tristis.",

Here we illustrate both points in a survey of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences used to study the population genetics of hibernating colonies of a migrating species, the noctule bat (Nyctalus noctula). Lacking samples from Scandinavian nursery colonies, we use a North European hibernacula to suggest that Scandinavian populations are isolated from Central and East European colonies. Then, we compare genetic diversities of nursery and hibernating colonies. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcantly higher haplotype diversity in hibernacula, conﬁrming that they consist of individuals from different nursery colonies. Finally, we show that pairwise comparisons of the haplotype frequencies of nursery and hibernating colonies contain some information on the migration direction of the noctule bat.",

I examined the importance of the cacti in the diets of the bats and found that 85–91 percent of their diet samples contained cactus pollen and seeds. At least 43 percent of the samples from each species contained cactus pollen andlor seeds exclusively.\n              Leptonycteris curasoae\n              consumes nectar and pollen of\n              Ceiba pentandra\n              and\n              Agave\n              spp. at the beginning of the dry season and\n              G. longirostris\n              also consumes a few other plant products in the wet season, but both bat species depend nutritionally on cacti. Female bats give birth to one pup per year, and the periods of parturition and lactation in each species correspond to peaks in the reproductive phenology of the two most abundant columnar cactus species. From personal observations and a review of the literature, I determined that bats were unlikely to fly to the mainland to feed, although\n              L. curasoae\n              may do so. I conclude that the interdependence of bats and cacti is suggestive of coevolution, and that columnar cacti are critical for the survival and persistence of nectar‐feeding bats on Curaçao.",

Botanical descriptions of some corolla behaviours (‘falling as a whole’) suggest bat removal of permanently closed corollas, as in D. biflora. Considering the remoteness of species of interest, we reviewed some Dillenia floral traits to hypothesise what they may mean for bat pollination of the genus. We investigated D. biflora pollen grains apertures and reviewed Dillenia literature concerning corolla behaviour and colour, and pollen apertures and presentation, including pores and staminodes. Our samples had dramatically different ratios of tricolpate to tetracolpate pollen grains, a trait that does not exclude pollination by bees. Petal colour polymorphism occurs, with mixed colours proportionately less common in flowers with corollas that open. The proportion of species with staminodes did not differ between those presumed to be pollinated by bats and others, but anthers of the former were significantly more likely to have apical pores, and stamens all had similar length or were slightly longer in the middle, whereas stamens in two distinct groups occurred in 55% of bee-­pollinated species. Pollen heteromorphy may facilitate pollination by different taxa in tropical environments. However, anther apical pores and stamen uniformity are more likely to be associated with bat-p­ ollinated species than are other morphologies. Dillenia could be a useful model to examine evolutionary aspects of colour, heteranthery, staminodes and pollen heteromorphy. Only field work will verify bat pollination and the implications of bat dependence for Dillenia species.",

Tests for population subdivision and direct observations suggest that females return to their natal sites, while males disperse. The males present in female nursery colonies are not related to the females. Paternity assessment for 46 offspring from a particular nursery colony showed that there are no males that monopolize the reproduction, and that the resident males in the colony had only a small mating success. Instead, the results suggest that females actively seek matings outside their colony. Most interestingly, it appears that a group of males about 16 km away from the nursery colony had a relatively high mating success and that this group of males may be related to the females of the nursery colonies. If this finding can be confirmed in a larger study, it may have important consequences for future conservation strategies.",

Design Clustered non-random sampling for serology, virus isolation and electron microscopy (EM). Procedure Serum samples were collected from 306 Pteropus spp. in northern and eastern Australia and tested for antibodies against Menangle virus (MenV) using a virus neutralisation test (VNT). Virus isolation was attempted from tissues and faeces collected from 215 Pteropus spp. in New South Wales. Faecal samples from 68 individual Pteropus spp. and four pools of faeces were examined by transmission EM following routine negative staining and immunogold labelling.\nResults Neutralising antibodies (VNT titres ≥ 8) against MenV were detected in 46% of black ﬂying foxes (P. alecto), 41% of grey-headed ﬂying foxes (P. poliocephalus), 25% of spectacled ﬂying foxes (P. conspicillatus) and 1% of little red ﬂying foxes (P. scapulatus) in Australia. Positive sera included samples collected from P. poliocephalus in a colony adjacent to a piggery that had experienced reproductive disease caused by MenV. Virus-like particles were observed by EM in faeces from Pteropus spp. and reactivity was detected in pooled faeces and urine by immunogold EM using sera from sows that had been exposed to MenV. Attempts to isolate the virus from the faeces and tissues from Pteropus spp. were unsuccessful.\nConclusion Serological evidence of infection with MenV was detected in Pteropus spp. in Australia. Although virus-like particles were detected in faeces, no viruses were isolated from faeces, urine or tissues of Pteropus spp.",

Given the onset of White-nose Syndrome (WNS) in the Commonwealth in the winter of 2009, we initiated yearly surveys in late summer 2009 to monitor the status of known summer populations. Our objectives were to examine the relative health of these bats using body mass index (BMI), and determine any changes in juvenile recruitment across sites and years. We did not find any marked changes in BMI across years after WNS for Gray Bats. This finding suggests that surviving bats are either not negatively impacted by WNS or have recovered sufficiently by late summer as to not document obvious differences across years. After limiting our analyses of juvenile recruitment to only the individuals that we had definitively aged via backlit photos (2010–2014), we found a non-significant declining trend in juvenile recruitment; a trend that merits continued monitoring in the years to come. As Gray Bats have only recently shown to be susceptible to WNS infection, it is possible that observable population declines are forthcoming.",

For many of these cryptic species, management is problematic due to the lack of information. We present data on space and habitat use of 14 radio-tagged Plecotus macrobullaris females from a nursery in the central part of the species’ distribution. They used home ranges larger than 10 km2, and the behavioural pattern was typically a first foraging bout soon after emergence from the nursery, followed by fast non-foraging flight towards selected habitat types. Habitat selection, as evaluated by K-select analysis, is non-random with preference for ecotones at woodland borders and rural areas, whereas woods are avoided. Body condition differentially affects habitat use for breeding and non-breeding females: breeding females in good condition showed a strong preference for ecotones. Among non-breeding females, the preference for ecotones varied with body condition. Being the sibling species of P. auritus, which is considered a woodland bat, the selection pattern observed for P. macrobullaris raises some questions about the possible niche partition in cases of sympatry.",

Lepidoptera dominated, having an average percent volume (APV) of 79% and constituting the bulk of the diet throughout the year. By decreasing importance in the diet, the insects identified were Neuroptera – mostly Chrysopidae (APV 9.2%), Diptera (APV 7.4%), Trichoptera (APV 2.2%) and Coleoptera (APV 1.4%). The diet was most diverse in late October. It seems that M. schreibersii is an aerial hawker that specialises in eating moths, but can opportunistically switch to other seasonably abundant prey. It hunts smallto medium-sized winged prey (wing length: 2–18 mm), of which most are tympanate insects.",

Host–parasite systems are useful for such studies because host-parasite assemblages are easily deﬁned units of study, each host individual harbours a sample from a community or assemblage, and many host species are common, providing replicate samples. I used ectoparasite assemblages from Noctilio leporinus collected from Paraguay to evaluate effects of host sex and body size on ectoparasite abundance and to determine if these assemblages exhibit a nested pattern of species co-occurrence. A total of 533 ectoparasites representing seven species and four families were collected from 28 hosts. Abundances of Paradyschiria fusca and Noctiliostrebla aitkeni responded positively to host body size. Host sex had no affect on ectoparasite abundances. Streblid bat ﬂy assemblages from Noctilio leporinus were strongly and signiﬁcantly nested. Abundances of all species of streblid were positively correlated with one another with Pearson product moment correlation coefﬁcients between 0.424 and 0.646. Competition does not appear to affect community structure of streblids from Paraguayan Noctilio leporinus. Independent responses of species of streblid to host characteristics appear to mould assemblage structure in this system.",

We explored the variability of isotopic niches using δ13C and δ15N ratios in fur from female and male bats in different reproductive states: pregnant, reproductive (but not pregnant at the time of this study), and nonreproductive females; nonscrotal and scrotal males using Bayesian standard ellipse areas and generalized linear models. Reproductive status was an informative predictor for the observed variation of both δ13C and δ15N ratios. Pregnant females displayed the highest mean δ13C and δ15N ratios and were distinct from other reproductive states. Reproductive females exhibited significantly higher δ15N ratios than nonreproductive females or nonscrotal and scrotal males, which may reflect state-dependent foraging and/or higher metabolic stress. Scrotal males displayed the lowest mean δ13C and δ15N ratios. Nonscrotal males exhibited the broadest isotopic niche, whereas reproductive females had the narrowest isotopic niche. Differences in isotopic niche sizes between the different reproductive groups may relate to variable individual feeding behavior and/or geographically different foraging areas/migratory stopover sites at individual and intraspecific levels in M. natalensis. This suggests that group-living, cave-dwelling bats may employ individual foraging specialization to facilitate coexistence in the broader geographic landscape.",

As a step towards the conservation of caves and cave-dwelling bats in South Africa, this study aimed to (i) broadly identify the number of caves used by bats (any species) and speciﬁcally M. natalensis, throughout South Africa, (ii) investigate the number of maternity and hibernacula roosts currently known for M. natalensis, (iii) assess the number of caves located in formal protected areas, (iv) determine potential migration paths/corridors between hibernacula and maternity sites and (v) evaluate the potential threats (like onshore wind facilities) along potential migratory routes. A meta-analysis of scientiﬁc literature and websites was conducted to identify caves throughout South Africa and locations of maternity and hibernacula roosts for M. natalensis. Roosts were assessed to determine whether (i) they were located in protected areas, (ii) they were used for eco-tourism and (iii) the distance to primary roads and onshore wind energy facilities. Next, likely migratory paths were modelled between maternity and hibernacula sites using least-cost path analysis and the threats along potential routes were investigated. A total of 92 caves were identiﬁed, 50 were reported to contain bats. M. natalensis were recorded in 37 caves, and of those, only 9% are currently located inside protected areas. A total of 12 least-cost paths were modelled, and various paths intersected potential threat risk elements. Our analysis provides the ﬁrst description of the potential migration corridors for M. natalensis in South Africa, as well as the current conservation status of bat-inhabited caves. For a developing country set to experience increased urbanisation pressures, this study highlights the need for conservation measures for South African caves and the dependent bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Rolling-circle (RC) transposons, or\n              Helitrons\n              , are a newly recognized group of eukaryotic transposable elements abundant in the genomes of plants, invertebrates, and zebrafish. We provide evidence for the colonization of a mammalian genome by\n              Helitrons\n              , which has not been reported previously. We identified and characterized two families of\n              Helitrons\n              in the little brown bat\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              . The consensus sequence for the first family,\n              HeliBat1\n              , displays the hallmarks of an autonomous\n              Helitron\n              , including coding capacity for an ≈1,500-aa protein with an RC replication motif and a region related to the SF1 superfamily of DNA helicases. The\n              HeliBatN1\n              family is a nonautonomous\n              Helitron\n              family that is only distantly related to\n              HeliBat1\n              . The two\n              HeliBat\n              families have attained high copy numbers (≈15,000 and > 100,000 copies, respectively) and make up at least ≈3% of the\n              M. lucifugus\n              genome. Sequence divergence and cross-species analyses indicate that both\n              HeliBat\n              families have amplified within the last ≈30–36 million years and are restricted to the lineage of vesper bats. We could not detect the presence of\n              Helitrons\n              in any other order of placental mammals, despite the broad representation of these taxa in the databases. We describe an instance of\n              HeliBat\n              -mediated transduction of a host gene fragment that was subsequently dispersed in ≈1,000 copies throughout the\n              M. lucifugus\n              genome. Given the demonstrated propensity of RC transposons to mediate the duplication and shuffling of host genes in bacteria and maize, it is tempting to speculate that the massive amplification of\n              Helitrons\n              in vesper bats has influenced the evolutionary trajectory of these mammals.",

Apparent survival of adult females over winter was calculated using markrecapture analysis over 5 years. Annual survival varied from 0.75 (95% CI = 0.54-0.88) to 0.89 (0.48-0.99) at Hanging Rock and 0.55 (0.39-0.71) to 0.91 (0.44-0.99) at Grand Canyon. Estimates of apparent survival were consistent with those from a longer-term study of long-tailed bats in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, South Island. The intrinsic rate of increase (λ) at Hanging Rock was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.4-0.99), indicating that this population may be declining more rapidly than that in the Eglinton Valley. At Grand Canyon, population estimates fluctuated annually, with no clear trend. Predation by introduced mammals and loss of habitat likely caused declines at Hanging Rock. Management of these factors is essential to avoid the local extinction of the species. Long-term monitoring (greater than 5 years) is required to determine more robust population trends for these long-tailed bat populations.",

There was a signiﬁcant overall effect between bat, distance to the ground, and its ﬂight speed on pulse duration and interpulse interval (IPI). The data imply that overall bats reduce pulse duration, IPI, and bandwidth as they approach the cave and slow down, but the behavior changes among individuals.",

If precautions are not taken, the spread of G. destructans by human transportation for scientific study may be a substantial threat to bat populations. We investigated the viability of G. destructans after being exposed to commonly used DNA/RNA preservation methods. Our first experiment revealed that G. destructans is able to germinate after an eight day storage period in RNAlater or kept dry but could not germinate after storage in 70% or absolute ethanol for the same time period. Storing G. destructans samples at different temperatures did not substantially affect the results. In a second experiment, we showed that G. destructans conidia were only killed after being stored in 70% ethanol for a minimum of 24 hours while only 30 minutes were necessary when stored in absolute ethanol. Our results suggest that the DNA/RNA preservation method has an important impact on the ability of G. destructans to remain viable and should therefore be considered before samples are transported, especially to regions where the fungus has not yet been documented. Our results also strongly advocate the use of high concentrations (i.e., absolute) ethanol over 70% ethanol to rapidly kill G. destructans.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats face numerous threats associated with global environmental change, including the rapid expansion of wind-energy facilities, emerging infectious disease, and habitat loss. An understanding of the movement and migration patterns of these highly dispersive animals would help reveal how spatially localized the impacts from these threats are likely to be on bat populations, thus aiding in their conservation. Stable hydrogen isotope ratios (δ2H) can be used to infer regions where bats have foraged during the summer molt season, thus allowing an assessment of summering location and distance of movement of bats sampled during other times of year. However, a major impediment to the application of δ2H for inference of bat movements is that the relationship between δ2H of bat hair and precipitation tends to be species specific and is still unknown for some key species of conservation concern. We addressed this issue by using geo-referenced museum specimens to calibrate the relationship between δ2H of hair (δ2Hhair) and long-term δ2H of growing-season precipitation (δ2HGSprecip) at the site of collection for eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), one of the main species of bats experiencing large numbers of fatalities at wind-energy facilities in North America. Based on comparison of δ2Hhair and δ2HGSprecip values for males we estimated a period of molt of June 14–August 7. Within this period, male and female red bats exhibited a significant positive relationship between δ2Hhair and δ2HGSprecip. These results establish the relationship between δ2Hhair and δ2HGSprecip for red bats, which is necessary for the use of δ2Hhair to infer the movement and migration patterns of this important species. These results provide a critical resource to conservation biologists working to assess the impacts of environmental change on bat populations.",

The mitogenome size of P. coromandra was 17,153 bp, with a control region and a typical set of 37 mitochondrial genes. The nucleotide composition of the P. coromandra mitogenome showed an AT bias with a nucleotide composition of 33.5% A, 30.7% T, 13.3% G, and 22.5% C. The mitochondrial protein-coding genes in P. coromandra use the standard start codon (ATN), two stop codons (TAA and AGA), and two incomplete stop codons (TA- and T–). The intertribal relationship of four tribes was highly resolved from the phylogenetic analysis of mitogenome sequences.",

We investigated the ingestion and effects of Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bats, Epomophorus wahlbergi, on the germination and seedling emergence of four Ficus species in separate laboratory feeding trials in KwaZulu-­Natal Province, South Africa. We observed seedling emergence and germination rates for all ingested seeds, whole and de-p­ ulped fruits. Our results showed that ingestion amounts were high and the germination of Ficus seeds was positively influenced by mastication and/or gut passage of E. wahlbergi, underscoring the potential of fruit bats as effective seed dispersers.",

We analysed fragments of its prey from faeces and from underneath feeding perches to describe its diet from four sites. Diet was similar across sites and Coleoptera was the main prey item by percentage volume (75%), followed by Hemiptera (13%). Carabidae and Scarabidae were the most frequent coleopterans found in the diet. Direct observations (n = 3) were made of bats ﬂying short distances from perches along forest trails to prey on Cicadidae (c. 20 mm in length) located on tree trunks. There were differences in the composition of faecal samples collected form netted bats and pellets collected under feeding perches, with the latter consisting of more Blattoptera (Blattellidae ‘cockroaches’). Hipposideros commersoni appears to have a unique foraging behaviour and diet among Malagasy microchiropterans and its preference for certain Coleoptera and other large invertebrates may account for reported seasonal variation in body fattening and activity.",

            "abstractNote": "Macronycteris commersoni (Hipposideridae), a bat species endemic to Madagascar, is widespread across the island and utilizes a range of habitat types including open woodland, degraded habitats, and forested areas from sea level to 1,325 m. Despite being widely distributed, there is evidence that M. commersoni exhibits morphological and bioacoustic variation across its geographical range. We investigated the finescale phylogeographic structure of populations in the western half of the island using extensive spatial sampling and sequence data from two mitochondrial DNA regions. Our results indicated several lineages within M. commersoni. Individuals collected from northern Madagascar formed a single monophyletic clade (clade C). A second clade (clade B) included individuals collected from the south-western portion of the island. This second clade displayed more phylogeographical partitioning with differences in mtDNA haplotypes frequency detected between populations collected in different bioclimatic regions. Lineage dispersal, genetic divergence, and timing of expansion events of M. commersoni were probably associated with Pleistocene climate fluctuations. Our data suggest that the northern and the central western regions of Madagascar may have acted as refugia for this species during periods of cooler and drier climate conditions associated with the Pleistocene.",

We caught 593 bats, 229 newly caught and 364 recaptures, exclusively males, roosting in 37 day roosts in the partially unfurled central leaves of R. madagascariensis. No bats were found in any other roosting situation. To analyse potential roost availability, we monitored partially unfurled central leaves on R. madagascarienis on four transects and 12% appeared suitable as M. aurita roosts. These leaves took three to 25 days to unfurl, and roosts became available between one and 19 days after unfurling commenced. Day roosts were occupied for one to 12 days. Bats were more likely to occupy roosts in taller trees. The size of roosting groups varied between one and 36 individuals. Movements of bats between roosts were recorded on 35 occasions and between two and nine individuals of M. aurita found in one roost were subsequently found together in a different roost. Myzopoda aurita occurs in degraded forests and anthropogenic habitats of eastern Madagascar where it may be affected by loss of roosts since R. madagascariensis is used extensively for building and thatching houses.",

Adult bats were captured at different localities across the island, measured, and their echolocation calls recorded. On average, male T. auritus and T. furculus have shorter forearms (47.0 and 44.0 mm, respectively) and emit higher frequency calls (107.8 and 113.1 kHz, respectively) than females (47.5 and 45.7 mm and 95.6 and 98.2 kHz, respectively), representing a form of reversed sexual dimorphism (females larger than males). However, T. menamena shows typical patterns of sexual size dimorphism with males having a longer forearm (51.7 mm) and lower frequency echolocation calls (82.3 kHz) than females (49.0 mm and 93.5 kHz, respectively). When segregated by sex, there was a strong allometric relationship between forearm length, used as a measure of body size, and the resting frequency in these three species, as well as two African hipposiderids (T. afer and Cloeotis percivali). Triaenops auritus males and both sexes of T. furculus deviated from the relationship between these two variables. Hypotheses are explored to explain the drivers of these sexual dimorphism patterns. On the basis of the allometric relationship, the strong correlation is in parallel to other groups of bats and is probably associated with ecological constraints. Recent phylogenetic analyses showed a separation of Afro-Malagasy Triaenops into two sister clades: T. auritus/T. furculus (suggested to be placed in a new genus, Paratriaenops) and T. menamena/T. afer. The patterns of sexual dimorphism in these taxa are congruent with clade membership. Further studies are needed to understand strategies used by these taxa when in sympatry to share habitat and ecological niches.",

Little is known about potential sexual differences in the echolocation calls of this species. We captured 59 adult individuals (24 males and 35 females) at different sites spanning the western half of Madagascar, measured their forearm length and recorded echolocation calls. These data were used to examine possible variation in echolocation calls and body size, which showed statistically significant differences. Male H. commersoni have an average forearm length of 93.1 mm and emit calls at 68.6 kHz, while the average measurements for females are 83.9 mm and about 72.9 kHz, respectively. Principal component analysis revealed variation in morphological and bioacoustic parameters, suggesting a high intraspecific variation. Regression analysis of intersexual data showed that females from the far north (Ankarana) significantly deviate from the allometric relationship by emitting echolocation calls lower than predicted by their size. These divergences may be associated with phenotypic variation, migratory movements or presence of a possible cryptic species. Detailed phylogenetic and phylogeographical analyses of the H. commersoni complex are needed to address these questions.",

Human alterations to ecosystems may affect predators’ foraging activity by changing landscape features, prey types, and prey availability. Assessing the selection of foraging habitats in a heterogeneous landscape can provide data to improve land management and conservation policies. In Canada, the pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus (LeConte, 1856); Vespertilionidae) is listed as threatened partly because of loss or modification of shrub–steppe habitat. Our purpose was to determine if vineyards provide a suitable surrogate for foraging habitat relative to native habitat. We used pitfall traps to compare prey abundance in each habitat and analyzed faeces to assess diet composition. Over 24 nights, we surveyed both habitats for foraging bats. Bats foraged over vineyards, but we recorded significantly more foraging activity over native habitat. We collected over 2000 arthropods in pitfall traps and found significantly more in native habitat compared with vineyards. Species eaten by pallid bats were present in both habitats. Scarab beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabidae) and Jerusalem crickets (Orthopthera: Stenopelmatidae) represented the principal prey. The use of vineyards by pallid bats for foraging suggests that while they are adapting to a changing landscape, reduced prey abundance in vineyards may negatively affect them over the long term.",

We investigated use of torpor by free-ranging adult male pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) at the northern limit of their range in the semiarid Okanagan Valley in British Columbia, Canada. We predicted that males would use torpor frequently during the active season and that ambient temperature (Ta) as well as nutritional condition (body condition index [BCI]) would affect torpor use. We expected roost microclimate to be conducive to daily heterothermy given that roosts had cool morning temperatures that increased in the afternoon. We used temperature-sensitive radiotransmitters to measure skin temperature (Tskin) of 8 bats from June to August 2003. Seven individuals used torpor each day (n ¼ 54 tracking days) but not at night. Torpor duration increased as mean daytime Ta decreased albeit the relationship differed between individuals. There was no signiﬁcant effect of individual on the relationship between minimum Tskin during torpor and Ta. BCI was signiﬁcantly and inversely correlated with torpor bout duration. Mean daytime temperatures in rock crevice roosts approached 308C and ﬂuctuated less than Ta.",

Little is known about infection by Leishmania in bats in the state of Maranhão, Brazil. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of Leishmania in bats in Maranhão. Blood samples were collected from bat species for parasitological diagnosis. Samples of spleen and liver were collected for molecular analysis. All the blood cultures were negative. In two blood smears, organisms similar to amastigotes of Leishmania sp. were detected. Of the 116 samples, two spleen samples were positive and showed similarity to Leishmania infantum. Therefore, further studies are needed to elucidate whether bats take part in the epidemiological chain of leishmaniasis.",

We used radiotracking to locate roosting and foraging sites. Roosts, typically 5.4 ± 0.2 m from the ground, were always occupied by single bats and were found on branches of trees with a diameter at breast height of 8.2 ± 0.7 cm. Home range size was 31.8 ± 9.2 ha for males and 41.7 ± 12.9 ha for females. Roosts were always located within the foraging areas and only five (5.4%) of the 91 located were situated outside the sheltered littoral forest. Foraging bats made greatest use of natural, sheltered littoral forest and relatively few foraging sorties occurred beyond the forest edge. Females were not trapped during January and may undergo local movements at that time. There are no known caves in the vicinity of the study area and H. commersoni roosted only on trees. Previous studies in Madagascar have highlighted the importance of caves for bats and we now extend this to include tree roosts, within the evergreen rainforest.",

            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous bats require different resources for diurnal roosting and nocturnal feeding, and sound conservation planning requires knowledge of both. However, ranging behavior and habitat use by foraging bats are poorly known, especially within urban ecosystems. We studied foraging ﬂight behavior and use of an urban landscape by 14 white-striped free-tailed bats (Tadarida australis) in metropolitan Brisbane, Australia. Each evening, the bats emerged from day-roosts in tree-hollows and commuted rapidly to a feeding area (median travel speed 42.9 km/h, based on net distances moved during 10–20 min). Within 30 min from emergence their travel speed was greatly reduced (median 6.7 km/h) to a level that remained similar throughout subsequent hours while they foraged. Day-roosts were widely dispersed across the urban landscape, but foraging bats mostly restricted their movements to a localized area of a few kilometers diameter. This area was closer to a communal roost, visited periodically by all bats, than to their day-roosts (median distance from foraging bats to the communal roost 2.5 km; to their day-roosts 6.2 km). The bats showed a signiﬁcant preference for foraging above ﬂoodplain habitat, and did not prefer to feed above remnant forest. T. australis appears tolerant of deforestation and capable of persisting in urban landscapes, provided that roost trees are protected. However, it remains unknown whether a sustained availability of aerial prey depends on ﬂoodplains remaining undeveloped.",

Our observations indicate that the construction and maintenance of stem tents are primarily, if not exclusively, the behaviour of single males. A stem tent is formed in V. scundens when a single male C. sphinx severs up to 300 small- to medium-sized stems creating a partially flattened, bell-shaped cavity, and in P. fongifolia when a male severs a few medium- to small-sized branches and many leaf petioles, creating an entry/exit portal and space in which to roost. A tent constructed in V. scandens is completed in approximately 30 d, whereas one in P. longifoliu is completed in about 50 d. Stem-tent construction takes place mostly at night, but some stem chewing occurs in late afternoon. At night a stem tent is occupied by a single male, whereas females are usually absent. During the day the number of bats occupying completed tents is highly variable, ranging from two to 19 females (and their pups) and a single adult male. Tent construction is annually bimodal, which corresponds to a biannual breeding season. A dominant male sometimes deposits saliva on branches inside his tent cavity and actively defends this space from intrusions by other males. Both behaviours suggest forms of scent marking and territorial display. O u r observations indicate that dominant males construct tents, recruit females and then defend the tents (and their female occupants) for the purpose of gaining reproductive access. The variance in harem group size indicates that some tent-making males are more successful than others in recruiting females.",

This is particularly so for bats compared to other mammalian taxa, due to morphological conservatism. Here, we investigate West African bats of the Hipposideros caffer complex, an insectivorous bat group occurring throughout the Afrotropics. From samples collected in Ghana, we aim to resolve the cryptic diversity identified by mitochondrial (mt) DNA using nuclear genetic, acoustic, and external morphometric data. We confirmed the presence of four previously established mtDNA lineages within the H. caffer complex and found significant genetic divergence among lineages based on nuclear microsatellite data and significant differences in frequencies of echolocation calls and morphometric measures. From these new data, we conclude that H. caffer complex in West Africa consists of at least four distinct species. While the small-­sized species from coastal savanna could be assigned to H. caffer tephrus, the taxonomic identity of the three sympatric, similarly sized species pertaining to H. ruber from the forest zone of Central Ghana is yet to be assessed.",

This is the third known species of this endemic Philippine genus. The new species is distinguished from its congeners by consistent differences in adult body size, limb and tail proportions, coloration and texture of the pelage, and cranial and dental dimensions. Members of this genus are small, diurnal rodents that feed mainly on earthworms and other soil invertebrates, and occur in high elevation montane and mossy forests habitats. The new species may be restricted to the northern portion of the Cordillera Central, whereas its congeners occur in widely separated highland areas in other portions of Luzon. The fact that similar distribution patterns are seen for members of other endemic genera suggests that habitat vicariance may have shaped much of the diversiﬁcation of murid rodents on Luzon.",

            "abstractNote": "The genus Leptospira encompass 22 species of spirochaetes, with ten pathogenic species that have been recorded in more than 160 mammals worldwide. In the last two decades, the numbers of records of these agents associated with bats have increased exponentially, particularly in America. Although order Chiroptera represents the second most diverse order of mammals in Mexico, and leptospirosis represents a human and veterinary problem in the country, few studies have been conducted to identify potential wildlife reservoirs. The aim of this study was to detect the presence and diversity of Leptospira sp. in communities of bats in an endemic state of leptospirosis in Mexico. During January to September 2016, 81 bats of ten species from three localities of Veracruz, Mexico, were collected with mist nets. Kidney samples were obtained from all specimens. For the detection of Leptospira sp., we amplified several genes using specific primers. Amplicons of the expected size were submitted to sequencing, and sequences recovered were compared with those of reference deposited in GenBank using the BLAST tool. To identify their phylogenetic position, we realized a reconstruction using maximumlikelihood (ML) method. Twenty-five samples from three bat species (Artibeus lituratus, Choeroniscus godmani and Desmodus rotundus) showed the presence of Leptospira DNA. Sequences recovered were close to Leptospira noguchii, Leptospira weilii and Leptospira interrogans. Our results include the first record of Leptospira in bats from Mexico and exhibit a high diversity of these pathogens circulating in the state. Due to the finding of a large number of positive wild animals, it is necessary to implement a surveillance system in populations of the positive bats as well as in related species, in order to understand their role as carriers of this bacterial genus.",

            "abstractNote": "The genera Cimex Linnaeus and Oeciacus Stål (Heteroptera: Cimicidae) are common haematophagous ectoparasites of bats or birds in the Holarctic region. Both their phylogenetic relationship and the systematics of the entire family previously were based on data from morphology and host relationships. Relationships among nine species of the genus Cimex and three species of the genus Oeciacus were analysed here using two mitochondrial and three nuclear genes. Cimex was shown to be paraphyletic with respect to Oeciacus. Oeciacus is thus proposed as a synonym of Cimex. The characteristic phenotype of Oeciacus results from the specific host association with different species of swallows (Hirundinidae). The morphological characters that have been used as diagnostic for the genera were shown to be valid and can be further used for determination at species level. The present analyses recovered the four traditional morphologically defined species groups of the genus Cimex. However, their relationships were poorly resolved – only the C. hemipterus group showed a well-supported relationship to the C. pipistrelli group. The molecular differentiation within the Palaearctic C. pipistrelli and the Nearctic C. pilosellus species groups correlates with their karyotype differentiation. Furthermore, the analyses suggest poly- or paraphyly of the former genus Oeciacus. Either way this indicates there is a large amount of host-associated phenotypic convergence in either bat- or bird-associated groups of species. The probability of host choice and subsequent switch in Cimicidae are discussed and possible scenarios of the evolution of host association in species of Cimex are suggested.",

Most studies to date have produced contrasting results focused on the effect of a single parasite species despite the fact that hosts usually harbour a community of parasites that influences one another's impact on host immune response.\n                \n                \n                  We simultaneously assessed blood parasites, intestinal parasites and ectoparasite loads in male blackbirds and compared these measures to several immune indices to investigate how parasites explain the variation around the mean of these immune indices.\n                \n                \n                  Parasite loads covaried within hosts. Immune indices better reflected the interacting effects of these parasites than their independent effect. Immune indices may therefore be better indicators of ongoing pathogenic infections than immunocompetence. Furthermore, intestinal parasites explained a significant part of the variance in most immune indices through their interactions with other parasites, suggesting that they have a strong influence in modulating immune function.\n                \n                \n                  Taking the parasite community into account in immunoecology studies will certainly help increase our understanding of immune indices.",

In this study, we propose that microRNA could also play an important role in neuronal maintenance during hibernation. To explore this possibility, RT-PCR was employed to investigate the expression of eleven microRNAs from the brain tissue of euthermic control and torpid bats. Results show that eight microRNAs (miR-21, -29b, -103, -107, -124a, -132, -183 and -501) increased (1.2-1.9 fold) in torpid bats, while the protein expression of Dicer, a microRNA processing enzyme, did not significantly change during torpor. Bioinformatic analysis of the differentially expressed microRNA suggests that these microRNAs are mainly involved in two processes: (1) focal adhesion and (2) axon guidance. To determine the extent of microRNA sequence conservation in the bat, we successfully identified bat microRNA from sequence alignments against known mouse (Mus musculus) microRNA. We successfully identified 206 conserved pre-microRNA sequences, leading to the identification of 344 conserved mature microRNA sequences. Sequence homology of the identified sequences was found to be 94.76. ±. 3.95% and 98.87. ±. 2.24% for both pre- and mature microRNAs, respectively. Results suggest that brain function related to the differentiation of neurons and adaptive neuroprotection may be under microRNA control during bat hibernation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",

The noctule bats occupy only special man-made constructions which are similar in many ways to the natural hollows, providing the same or better climatic conditions than in a treehollow. The bats prefer similar height and width of entrances both in the trees and in the panel buildings. In summer the noctule bats prefer roosts situated on the western walls of panel buildings. The rhythm of temperature fluctuation in that side best corresponds to the daily life cycle of the bats. Because of the good roosting possibilities, the density is higher in housing estates than in natural forests. The noctule bats occupy buildings with well determined characteristics. When talking about urbanization, we do not refer to adaptation but only to the use of roosts having more advantageous conditions.",

            "abstractNote": "We investigated a large colony of European free-tailed bats (Tadarida teniotis) in Spain, using a combination of capture-mark-recapture data and direct observations. Its social and reproductive organisation is complex and the mating system fits a “resource defence polygyny” model. In spring and autumn, aggressive interactions in flight, defence of roosts and mating songs of males to attract females occurred. According to our results, T. teniotis is organised in “harems” consisting of a dominant male and a variable number of females. In addition the sexual cycle displayed a bimodal reproductive pattern (this is unique and remarkable for European bats). The bimodal pattern coincided with peaks in food availability (moths) at high altitudes. Presumably, roostguarding activities (patrolling, advertising…) make males less prone to move away (e.g. at higher altitudes and longer distances) from roosts, resulting in differences in prey selection and in altitudinal segregation between sexes. This provides a plausible explanation for the differences in diet (predation of more sedentary vs. high-flying migratory moths) between males and females that has been found in published studies.",

            "abstractNote": "The species of the genus Cimex (Heteroptera: Cimicidae) are important ectoparasites of European bats. Unlike other ectoparasites, they are attached to the body of their host only when they need to feed, otherwise they stay in refugia in bat roosts. Consequently, they are often overlooked by bat specialists and in many countries they are either unknown or poorly characterized. This study reports results from thorough investigations of bat roosts of diverse bat species in a Northwest-Southeast transect across Europe: Czech and Slovak Republics, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria. The distribution of Cimex lectularius follows the synanthropic habitats of its principal hosts, Myotis myotis and M. emarginatus, both Mediterranean elements of the European fauna. The climate in natural roosts (i.e. caves) inhabited by these bats in southern areas appears to restrain the presence of cimicids. In central Europe, C. pipistrelli parasitizes, beside M. myotis, many crevice-dwelling bat species indigenous to the boreal zone. However, in southern Europe, it appears only in connection with Nyctalus noctula. C. lectularius was confirmed for five host bat species and newly recorded for Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, C. pipistrelli was confirmed for seven bat species and newly recorded for Myotis nattereri. The first record of C. emarginatus outside of its type locality and Myotis alcathoe as a new host are reported. The host preferences of the species of the genus Cimex are discussed.",

The Cimex pipistrelli species group parasitizes on bats, the likely ancestral hosts of the whole family. Based on morphology, it was suggested that three species of the group were present in the West-Palaearctic region, although their validity remained a matter of discussion. Surprisingly, the status of these species has not been studied from the point of view of host speciﬁcity. We examined the diversiﬁcation of the species group using morphological data, including the putative diagnostic characters, and sequences of one mitochondrial (cytochrome oxidase subunit I, COI) and four nuclear loci (internal transcribed spacer 2, 18S and 28s ribosomal genes and elongation factor 1 subunit a). This was carried out on a sample of 225 individuals from 69 bat roosts and 44 mist-netted bats, altogether representing 12 bat species from 13 European countries and Lebanon. We revealed 27 mitochondrial haplotypes representing two distinct haplogroups and one outlying haplotype. The extent of morphological variability of specimens representing both haplogroups covers the range of characters reported for all three recognized species; therefore, the haplogroups clearly do not correspond to any described species. Also, the very limited variability found in the nuclear sequences of the cimicid bugs examined suggests that separate species do not exist in the region. We found considerable morphological differentiation among samples from different bat species, although individuals representing particular mitochondrial haplogroups often live sympatrically and on the same host species. It seems that batbugs are morphologically adapted to a particular bat host despite the low genetic structuring among individuals parasitizing different species of bats.",

Using bat detectors, the islands of Mahé, Praslin and La Digue were surveyed to establish the current distribution of this species. Although two new roosts were discovered on Mahé, no bats were observed on Praslin and La Digue, and the range of C. seychellensis appears to have further contracted in the last 2 decades. A total of 19 C. seychellensis were counted emerging from or entering three roosts in boulder caves on Mahé during 18 evenings of observations. The bats foraged in open coastal habitat, some of it anthropogenic, and their echolocation calls were also characteristic of bats feeding in open habitat. This study provides no evidence that C. seychellensis is dependent on forest or wetland for foraging. Dietary analysis indicated that C. seychellensis feeds on Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Diptera. A public education programme to highlight the conservation status of the bat and the consequences of roost disturbance is recommended, together with the urgent need for legal protection of the bats and their roosts.",

            "abstractNote": "The vomeronasal organ (VNO) is known to be present in bats of the family Phyllostomidae, but in most species this is inferred from the presence of accessory olfactory bulbs. Like primates, bats have profound intergroup variations in the vomeronasal system. Of the family Phyllostomidae (49 genera, 143 species) the VNO of approximately 60 species has been studied. Here, we report light microscopic observations of the VNO of Anoura geoffroyi (fetus and adult), A. caudifer, and A. cultrata, as well as ultrastructural observations of the VNO in adult A. geoffroyi. The organ is crescent-shaped, with a wide lumen encroached by a ‘‘mushroom body’’ that contains a venous sinus. In adults, the vomeronasal cartilage is reduced, being longer in absolute length in fetal A. geoffroyi compared with the adult. In the neuroepithelium, the receptor cell microvilli are dark, distinct, and short, emerging from a vesicular tuft; the supporting cell microvilli are relatively much longer. Large paravomeronasal ganglia are observed. The receptor-free epithelium is undulating and lacks cilia or microvilli. Some characteristics of the VNO in Anoura have not been reported in other chiropterans to date, such as the marked reduction of the vomeronasal cartilage and absence of cilia in the receptor-free epithelium. Moreover, if A. geoffroyi is representative, the genus has an adult neuroepithelial volume similar to other mammals of its body size. Further examination of uninvestigated phyllostomid VNOs may elucidate a phylogenetic history of the family, as well as ecological or social correlates of the VNO in the order Chiroptera.

In this study, we tested hypotheses concerning differences in occurrence, in periods of activity and reproduction, in morphology and diet between two sympatric and phylogenetically related bat species (Artibeus lituratus and A. planirostris) in the Cerrado region of Central Brazil. No differences were found in the occurrence, activity patterns, or breeding season between species. In contrast, the species presented dissimilar morphological traits and diets (28% of overlap in diet). Our analysis suggests that A. lituratus and A. planirostris do not compete strongly with each other. This lack of competition between species facilitates coexistence on a local scale in the studied Neotropical savanna.",
