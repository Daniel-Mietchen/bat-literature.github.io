            "abstractNote": "The fairy tube-nosed bat, Murina tiensa, is considered to be endemic to Vietnam. It is known only from the original description, when it was found at two localities in limestone karst areas. In 2008, we conducted a series of intensive field surveys throughout the country and obtained additional records of this species from various habitats, including degraded to nearly pristine forests and an offshore island. Our results indicate that M. tiensa is a sexually dimorphic species, females being considerably larger than males in all external and craniodental measurements. The species emits broadband, downward frequency-modulated echolocation calls with a dominant first harmonic. When handheld or when flying in a flight tent, signals had a similar structure and were emitted in groups of 2–4 signals. On average, signals swept from 150 to 49 kHz in 2.2 ms for handheld bats, and, from 145 to 50 kHz in 1.9 ms for flying bats. M. tiensa often occurred in sympatry with M. cyclotis and several rhinolophids.",

In this study, we compared characteristics of Nathusius' pipistrelles (\n              Pipistrellus nathusii\n              ) killed at wind turbines (\n              N\n               = 119) to those observed within the live population (\n              N\n               = 524) during the summer migration period in Germany. We used generalized linear mixed‐effects modeling to identify demographic groups most vulnerable to wind turbine mortality, including sex (female or male), age (adult or juvenile), and geographic origin (regional or long‐distance migrant; depicted by fur stable hydrogen isotope ratios). Juveniles contributed with a higher proportion of carcasses at wind turbines than expected given their frequency in the live population suggesting that juvenile bats may be particularly vulnerable to wind turbine mortality. This effect varied with wind turbine density. Specifically, at low wind turbine densities, representing mostly inland areas with water bodies and forests where Nathusius' pipistrelles breed, juveniles were found more often dead beneath turbines than expected based on their abundance in the live population. At high wind turbine densities, representing mostly coastal areas where Nathusius' pipistrelles migrate, adults and juveniles were equally vulnerable. We found no evidence of increased vulnerability to wind turbines in either sex, yet we observed a higher proportion of females than males among both carcasses and the live population, which may reflect a female bias in the live population most likely caused by females migrating from their northeastern breeding areas migrating into Germany. A high mortality of females is conservation concern for this migratory bat species because it affects the annual reproduction rate of populations. A distant origin did not influence the likelihood of getting killed at wind turbines. A disproportionately high vulnerability of juveniles to wind turbine mortality may reduce juvenile recruitment, which may limit the resilience of Nathusius' pipistrelles to environmental stressors such as climate change or habitat loss. Schemes to mitigate wind turbine mortality, such as elevated cut‐in speeds, should be implemented throughout Europe to prevent population declines of Nathusius' pipistrelles and other migratory bats.",

However, it is unknown which emission sources drive this disparity and whether differences exist by emission sector, geography, or demographics. Quantifying the PM\n              2.5\n              exposure caused by each emitter type, we show that nearly all major emission categories—consistently across states, urban and rural areas, income levels, and exposure levels—contribute to the systemic PM\n              2.5\n              exposure disparity experienced by people of color. We identify the most inequitable emission source types by state and city, thereby highlighting potential opportunities for addressing this persistent environmental inequity.",

            "abstractNote": "Several house bat specimens superficially resembling the white-bellied house bat Scotophilus leucogaster (Cretzschmar, 1830), were recently captured in southwestern Ethiopia and southern South Sudan. These S. cf. leucogaster differed from typical S. leucogaster by their slightly smaller size and ventral coloration, conforming instead with the original description of S. altilis Allen, 1914. Scotophilus altilis is an overlooked taxon known from the Blue Nile region in Sudan that is currently considered a junior synonym of S. leucogaster. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (cytb) sequences revealed S. cf. leucogaster as a sister clade to S. leucogaster with a genetic distance of ca. 10%. Comparative specimens of questionable S. nigritellus de Winton, 1899 from northwestern Ethiopia and a wing biopsy sample of another S. cf. leucogaster from western Kenya also fell within this clade. Sequence data from two nuclear markers (zfy and fgb7) corroborated the distinction of S. cf. leucogaster from S. leucogaster. Likewise, morphometric analysis of cranial data largely supported this distinction, as well as taxonomic affiliation with S. altilis based on comparison with the only available paratype specimen. The position of this paratype specimen within the new Scotophilus clade, inferred from analysis of a short fragment of cytb, confirmed its taxonomic identity. Based on the presented evidence, the overlooked East African taxon S. altilis should be resurrected as a full species within the genus Scotophilus.",

Therefore, the four-year LIFE Nature programme \"Conservation of three cave-dwelling bats in Southern France\" included an autoecological study of Miniopterus schreibersii, a highly gregarious cave-dwelling species. In a colony of 3-5,000 adults, 21 females were radio-tracked during pregnancy and lactating periods, when some of them switched roosts within a 30 km radius around the maternity colony. Every night, for about 6 hours, each bat flew far from the roost (4.1 to 29.2 km) to forage on several small feeding areas (1 to 9 over a few nights). Mean individual home-range estimation averaged 10837 ha for pregnant females, 22318 ha for lactating females. Urban areas lighted by white street lamps were used extensively. Some bats also foraged selectively in deciduous or mixed woodlands and in orchards and parks. The importance of hedgerows was confirmed. Conservation of M. schreibersii must be planned at a large scale, protecting a network of roosts and promoting nature-friendly agricultural practices.",

            "abstractNote": "Like other small terrestrial mammals, bats have a high mass-speciﬁc energetic demand because of the fact that they have an unfavorable surface area to volume ratio. Furthermore, bats have a very energy-expensive mode of locomotion: ﬂight. This high energetic demand has to be covered by food intake. The retention time of the digestive tract is one factor affecting the energy intake of bat species. Factors like energy demand, gut volume and dietary specialization inﬂuence retention time in mammals. However, maximum retention time for only Myotis myotis and transit time only for M. lucifugus, Nyctophilius gloudi and Nyctalus noctula is known. This study investigated the maximum retention times and transit times of 10 Central European bat species. It was hypothesized that the level of specialization of the digestive tract, energy-demanding processes and intestine length would affect the retention time of bats. Fluorescence-marked mealworms Tenebrio molitor were used to measure the time between the ﬁrst ingested mealworm and the ﬁrst appearance of the marker or the last ﬂuorescing feces, respectively. For the ﬁrst time, the retention time of 10 insectivorous bat species was measured to determine interspeciﬁc differences. Additionally, we measured the retention time of post-lactating female and spermatogenically active male Pipistrellus pipistrellus to determine intraspeciﬁc differences. The retention time of bats differed signiﬁcantly between species and is probably inﬂuenced by the level of specialization of the digestive tract. High-level specialization of the digestive tract resulted in short retention times. Furthermore, signiﬁcant intraspeciﬁc differences between postlactating and spermatogenically active individuals of P. pipistrellus showed that the retention time within a single species might be inﬂuenced by energy-demanding processes (e.g. reproduction).",

Knowledge of diet diversity in animals helps us understand niche partitioning, functional diversity and ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control and seed dispersal.\n                \n                \n                  There is a negative relationship between the length of the digestive tract and diet diversity in animals; however, the role of digestive physiology in determining diet diversity has been ignored.

In all taxa studied, bite force is strongly correlated with body and head size. Studies of bite force in bats have largely centred on neotropical species with a particular focus on species that maximize dietary differences. Little is known about the bite force of bats from the Old World tropics, nor of variation in bite force within diverse assemblages of obligate insectivores. Moreover, factors other than size are poorly known but may be important in driving interspecific differences in bite force, and thereby diet.\n                \n                \n                  Here, we examine the correlation between morphological variation and bite force of 35 species of insectivorous bats from a single palaeotropical assemblage. We confirmed the overall relationship between size and bite force across species, but found that bite force is predicted more strongly by head length than body mass or forearm length.\n                \n                \n                  From the combined action of jaw muscles and muscle‐bone mechanisms, bats generate a mechanical advantage that creates pressure during biting. We calculated the size‐independent mechanical advantage for each of five mandible lever systems (three delineated by the temporalis muscle and two delineated by the masseter muscle) operating through three function points (molar, canine and incisor). Size‐independent mechanical advantage of the suprazygomatic portion of the temporalis muscle at the molar function point was the only significant predictor of size‐independent maximum bite force across all species.\n                \n                \n                  Within families, the size‐independent mechanical advantage of the superficial portion of the masseter muscle plays a significant role in predicting size‐independent maximum bite force in both the Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae. For the family Hipposideridae, however, size‐independent mechanical advantage showed no role in predicting size‐independent maximum bite force, suggesting that size really matters in predicting the maximum bite force capacity for this family.",

Here we describe the development and application of models to predict habitat use of a common insectivorous bat (Eptesicus fuscus) based upon δ13C and δ15N signatures of skin tissue. We used a 42-specimen sample collected from three well-characterized ecogeographic regions, disparate both in photosynthetic mechanism and fertilizer use, to generate the models. Significant univariate differences between these three sites in terms of δ13C (F2, 39 = 112.92, P < 0.0001) and δ15N (F2, 39 = 97.06, P < 0.0001), and multivariate significance of both variables (Wilk’s λ = 0.032, F4, 76 = 87.02, P < 0.0001), made it possible to develop three predictive models using Fisher’s linear discriminant functions: 1) a model predicting if bats forage in C3 or mixed C3/C4 sites, 2) a model predicting if bats forage in agricultural areas, and 3) a combined model using both variables to predict specific habitat use. We present the results of model application to an independent dataset of 329 bats sampled from 10 states that included a broad range of δ13C (-26.53‰ ≤ δ13C ≤ -17.20‰) and δ15N (6.36‰ ≤ δ15N ≤ 15.60‰) signatures. We validated the use of skin tissue samples (from wing membranes) in the model by comparing the sites used for model development across five tissue types, selecting skin samples for model development due to consistently low variance within this tissue type. Our results indicate nonspecific habitat-use by big brown bats.",

We reconsider this idea by means of detailed phylogenetic analyses of sequence data available for the Filoviridae: using coalescent simulations, we ascertain that two Marburg isolates (termed the “RAVN” strain) represent a quite-distinct lineage that should be considered in studies of biogeography and host associations, and may merit recognition at the level of species. In contrast, ﬁlovirus isolates recently obtained from bat tissues are not distinct from previously known strains, and should be considered as drawn from the same population. Implications for understanding the transmission geography and host associations of these viruses are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Resource exploitation and competition for food are important selective pressures in animal evolution. A number of recent investigations have focused on linkages between diversiﬁcation, trophic morphology and diet in bats, partly because their roosting habits mean that for many bat species diet can be quantiﬁed relatively easily through faecal analysis. Dietary analysis in mammals is otherwise invasive, complicated, time consuming and expensive. Here we present evidence from insectivorous bats that analysis of three-dimensional (3-D) textures of tooth microwear using International Organization for Standardization (ISO) roughness parameters derived from sub-micron surface data provides an additional, powerful tool for investigation of trophic resource exploitation in mammals. Our approach, like scale-sensitive fractal analysis, offers considerable advantages over twodimensional (2-D) methods of microwear analysis, including improvements in robustness, repeatability and comparability of studies. Our results constitute the ﬁrst analysis of microwear textures in carnivorous mammals based on ISO roughness parameters. They demonstrate that the method is capable of dietary discrimination, even between cryptic species with subtly different diets within trophic guilds, and even when sample sizes are small. We ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in microwear textures between insectivore species whose diet contains different proportions of ‘hard’ prey (such as beetles) and ‘soft’ prey (such as moths), and multivariate analyses are able to distinguish between species with different diets based solely on their tooth microwear textures. Our results show that, compared with previous 2-D analyses of microwear in bats, ISO roughness parameters provide a much more sophisticated characterization of the nature of microwear surfaces and can yield more robust and subtle dietary discrimination. ISO-based textural analysis of tooth microwear thus has a useful role to play, complementing existing approaches, in trophic analysis of mammals, both extant and extinct.",

Here, we describe a new fauna of Chiroptera from the middle Eocene Shanghuang fissure fillings of China. The fauna includes abundant material referred to a new rhinolophid (\n              \n                P\n                rotorhinolophus shanghuangensis\n              \n              gen. and sp. n.), one specimen of a possible rhinopomatid and several indeterminate rhinolophoids. This new bat assemblage constitutes the earliest record of extant families of microbats in Asia. Because it lacks representatives of ‘Eochiroptera’, this Shanghuang bat fauna indicates significant turnover in Asian bat communities. The dental pattern of\n              P. shanghuangensis\n              shows a mosaic of primitive and derived features (‘Eochiroptera’\n              vs\n              Rhinolophidae dental characteristics), suggesting that this taxon occupies a basal position among the Rhinolophidae. Rhinolophids were already well diversified at the end of the late Eocene in Europe. Interestingly, many dental characteristics of\n              \n                P\n                rotorhinolophus\n              \n              are also found in a primitive rhinolophoid taxon,\n              \n                V\n                aylatsia\n              \n              , from the middle Eocene to late Oligocene of Europe, supporting a close relationship between these taxa. These affinities testify to the widespread Eurasian distribution of rhinolophoids during the Eocene and are consistent with a westward dispersal of the group from eastern Asia to Europe owing to the greater antiquity of\n              \n                P\n                rotorhinolophus\n              \n              .",

            "abstractNote": "Comparative correlational studies of brain size and ecological traits (e.g. feeding habits and habitat complexity) have increased our knowledge about the selective pressures on brain evolution. Studies conducted in bats as a model system assume that shared evolutionary history has a maximum effect on the traits. However, this effect has not been quantiﬁed. In addition, the effect of levels of diet specialization on brain size remains unclear. We examined the role of diet on the evolution of brain size in Mormoopidae and Phyllostomidae using two comparative methods. Body mass explained 89% of the variance in brain volume. The effect of feeding behaviour (either characterized as feeding habits, as levels of specialization on a type of item or as handling behaviour) on brain volume was also signiﬁcant albeit not consistent after controlling for body mass and the strength of the phylogenetic signal (k). Although the strength of the phylogenetic signal of brain volume and body mass was high when tested individually, k values in phylogenetic generalized least squares models were signiﬁcantly different from 1. This suggests that phylogenetic independent contrasts models are not always the best approach for the study of ecological correlates of brain size in New World bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Heterogeneous pathogenic stress can shape major histocompatibility complex (MHC) diversity by influencing the functional plasticity of the immune response. Therefore, MHC diversity could reflect environmental stress, demonstrating its importance in uncovering the mechanisms of adaptive genetic variation. In this study, we combined neutral microsatellite loci, an immune-­related MHC II-­DRB locus, and climatic factors to unravel the mechanisms affecting the diversity and genetic differentiation of MHC genes in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), a species with a wide geographical distribution that has three distinct genetic lineages in China. First, increased genetic differentiation at the MHC locus among populations compared using microsatellites indicated diversifying selection. Second, the genetic differentiation of MHC and microsatellites were significantly correlated, suggesting that demographic processes exist. However, MHC genetic differentiation was significantly correlated with geographical distance among populations, even after controlling for the neutral markers, suggesting a major effect of selection. Third, although the MHC genetic differentiation was larger than that for microsatellites, there was no significant difference in the genetic differentiation between the two markers among genetic lineages, indicating the effect of balancing selection. Fourth, combined with climatic factors, MHC diversity and supertypes showed significant correlations with temperature and precipitation, but not with the phylogeographic structure of R. ferrumequinum, suggesting an effect of local adaptation driven by climate on MHC diversity. Moreover, the number of MHC supertypes varied between populations and lineages, suggesting regional characteristics and support for local adaptation. Taken together, the results of our study provide insights into the adaptive evolutionary driving forces at different geographic scales in R. ferrumequinum. In addition, climate factors may have played a vital role in driving adaptive evolution in this species.",

The African naked mole-rat (\n              Heterocephalus glaber\n              ) and hibernating mammals share similar environments and physiological features. In the naked mole-rat, acid insensitivity has been shown to be conferred by the functional motif of the sodium ion channel Na\n              V\n              1.7. There is now an opportunity to evaluate acid insensitivity in other taxa. In this study, we tested for functional convergence of Na\n              V\n              1.7 in 71 species of mammals, including 22 species that hibernate. Our analyses revealed a functional convergence of amino acid sequences, which occurred at least six times independently in mammals that hibernate. Evolutionary analyses determined that the convergence results from both parallel and divergent evolution of residues in the functional motif. Our findings not only identify the functional molecules responsible for acid insensitivity in hibernating mammals, but also open new avenues to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of acid insensitivity in mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "The east-coast free-tailed bat Mormopterus norfolkensis Gray, 1839 is a threatened insectivorous bat that is poorly known and as such conservation management strategies are only broadly prescribed. Insectivorous bats that use human-modiﬁed landscapes are often adapted to foraging in open microhabitats. However, few studies have explored whether open-adapted bats select landscapes with more of these microhabitat features.We compared three morphologically similar and sympatric, molossid bats (genus Mormopterus) with different conservation status in terms of their association with vegetation, climate, landform and land-use attributes at landscape and local habitat element scales.We predicted that these species would use similar landscape types, with semi-cleared and low density urban landscapes used more than forested and heavily cleared landscapes. Additionally, we explored which environmental variables best explained the occurrence of each species by constructing post-hoc models and habitat suitability maps. Contrary to predictions, we found that the three species varied in their habitat use with no one landscape type used more extensively than other types. Overall, M. norfolkensis was more likely to occur in low-lying, non-urban, riparian habitats with little vegetation cover. Mormopterus species 2 occupied similar habitats, but was more tolerant of urban landscapes. In contrast, Mormopterus species 4 occurred more often in cleared than forested landscapes, particularly dry landscapes with little vegetation cover.The extensive use of coastal ﬂoodplains by the threatened M. norfolkensis is signiﬁcant because these habitats are under increasing pressure from human land-uses and the predicted increase in urbanization is likely to further reduce the amount of suitable habitat.",

            "abstractNote": "Habitat loss and resultant fragmentation are major threats to biodiversity, particularly in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. It is increasingly urgent to understand fragmentation effects, which are often complex and vary across taxa, time and space. We determined whether recent fragmentation of Atlantic forest is causing population subdivision in a widespread and important Neotropical seed disperser: Artibeus lituratus (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae). Genetic structure within highly fragmented forest in Paraguay was compared to that in mostly contiguous forest in neighbouring Misiones, Argentina. Further, observed genetic structure across the fragmented landscape was compared with expected levels of structure for similar time spans in realistic simulated landscapes under different degrees of reduction in gene ﬂow. If fragmentation signiﬁcantly reduced successful dispersal, greater population differentiation and stronger isolation by distance would be expected in the fragmented than in the continuous landscape, and genetic structure in the fragmented landscape should be similar to structure for simulated landscapes where dispersal had been substantially reduced. Instead, little genetic differentiation was observed, and no signiﬁcant correlation was found between genetic and geographic distance in fragmented or continuous landscapes. Furthermore, comparison of empirical and simulated landscapes indicated empirical results were consistent with regular long-distance dispersal and high migration rates. Our results suggest maintenance of high gene ﬂow for this relatively mobile and generalist species, which could be preventing or signiﬁcantly delaying reduction in population connectivity in fragmented habitat. Our conclusions apply to A. lituratus in Interior Atlantic Forest, and do not contradict broad evidence that habitat fragmentation is contributing to extinction of populations and species, and poses a threat to biodiversity worldwide.",

            "abstractNote": "Automated monitoring technologies can increase the efﬁciency of ecological data collection and support data-driven conservation. Camera traps coupled with infrared light barriers can be used to monitor temperate-zone bat assemblages at underground hibernacula, where thousands of individuals of multiple species can aggregate in winter. However, the broad-scale adoption of such photo-monitoring techniques is limited by the time-consuming bottleneck of manual image processing. Here, we present BatNet, an open-source, deep learning-based tool for automated identiﬁcation of 13 European bat species from camera trap images. BatNet includes a user-friendly graphical interface, where it can be retrained to identify new bat species or to create site-speciﬁc models to improve detection accuracy at new sites. Model accuracy was evaluated on images from both trained and untrained sites, and in an ecological context, where community- and species-level metrics (species diversity, relative abundance, and species-level activity patterns) were compared between human experts and BatNet. At trained sites, model performance was high across all species (F1-score: 0.98–1). At untrained sites, overall classiﬁcation accuracy remained high (96.7–98.2%), when camera placement was comparable to the training images (<3 m from the entrance; <45° angle relative to the opening). For atypical camera placements (>3 m or >45° angle), retraining the detector model with 500 site-speciﬁc annotations achieved an accuracy of over 95% at all sites. In the ecological case study, all investigated metrics were nearly identical between human experts and BatNet. Finally, we exemplify the ability to retrain BatNet to identify a new bat species, achieving an F1-score of 0.99 while maintaining high classiﬁcation accuracy for all original species. BatNet can be implemented directly to scale up the deployment of camera traps in Europe and enhance bat population monitoring. Moreover, the pretrained model can serve as a baseline for transfer learning to automatize the image-based identiﬁcation of bat species worldwide.",

            "abstractNote": "We compared the diversity, taxonomic composition, and pollination syndromes of bromeliad assemblages and the diversity and abundance of hummingbirds along two climatically contrasting elevational gradients in Bolivia. Elevational patterns of bromeliad species richness differed noticeably between transects. Along the continuously wet Carrasco transect, species richness peaked at mid-elevations, whereas at Masicur´ı most species were found in the hot, semiarid lowlands. Bromeliad assemblages were dominated by large epiphytic tank bromeliads at Carrasco and by small epiphytic, atmospheric tillandsias at Masicur´ı. In contrast to the epiphytic taxa, terrestrial bromeliads showed similar distributions across both transects. At Carrasco, hummingbird-pollination was the most common pollination mode, whereas at Masicur´ı most species were entomophilous. The proportion of ornithophilous species increased with elevation on both transects, whereas entomophily showed the opposite pattern. At Carrasco, the percentage of ornithophilous bromeliad species was signiﬁcantly correlated with hummingbird abundance but not with hummingbird species richness. Bat-pollination was linked to humid, tropical conditions in accordance with the high species richness of bats in tropical lowlands. At Carrasco, mixed hummingbird/bat-pollination was found especially at mid-elevations, i.e., on the transition between preferential bat-pollination in the lowlands and preferential hummingbird-pollination in the highlands. In conclusion, both richness patterns and pollination syndromes of bromeliad assemblages varied in distinct and readily interpretable ways in relation to environmental humidity and temperature, and bromeliad pollination syndromes appear to follow the elevational gradients exhibited by their pollinators.",

Recent studies also demonstrate the value of both rangewide sampling and species distribution modelling (SDM) in comparative phylogeography. Here, we combine these approaches to study the population histories of four phylogenetically related forest-dependent bat species. All are endemic to the mountainous island of Taiwan but show differences in their tolerance to altitude, with Murina gracilis considered to be a high-altitude specialist, M. recondita and Kerivoula sp. low-altitude specialists, and M. puta an altitudinal generalist. We tested the prediction that contrasting habitat preferences would impact on patterns of past and contemporary gene ﬂow and found broad concordance between the results of population genetic analyses and species distribution models based on the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate. Both lowland species showed evidence of genetic divergence between the east and west of the island, consistent with SDMs that indicated the Central Mountain Range (CMR) has presented a long-term and continuous barrier to gene ﬂow since before the Last Glacial Maximum. In contrast, Murina gracilis and M. puta showed lower degrees of historical isolation and genetic differentiation associated with the CMR, reﬂecting greater gene ﬂow, possibly coupled with past population growth in M. puta. Together our results highlight the usefulness of combining distribution models with phylogeographic analyses to understand the drivers of genetic structure.",

The two bat species Murina gracilis and Murina recondita are both endemic to Taiwan and are putative sister species. To test for nonallopatric divergence and gene ﬂow in these taxa, we generated sequences using Sanger and next-generation sequencing, and combined these with microsatellite data for coalescent-based analyses. MtDNA phylogenies supported the reciprocally monophyletic sister relationship between M. gracilis and M. recondita; however, clustering of microsatellite genotypes revealed several cases of species admixture suggesting possible introgression. Sequencing of microsatellite ﬂanking regions revealed that admixture signatures stemmed from microsatellite allele homoplasy rather than recent introgressive hybridization, and also uncovered an unexpected sister relationship between M. recondita and the continental species Murina eleryi, to the exclusion of M. gracilis. To dissect the basis of these conﬂicts between ncDNA and mtDNA, we analysed sequences from 10 anonymous ncDNA loci with *BEAST and isolation-withmigration and found two distinct clades of M. eleryi, one of which was sister to M. recondita. We conclude that Taiwan was colonized by the ancestor of M. gracilis ﬁrst, followed by the ancestor of M. recondita after a period of allopatric divergence. After colonization, the mitochondrial genome of M. recondita was replaced by that of the resident M. gracilis. This study illustrates how apparent signatures of sympatric divergence can arise from complex histories of allopatric divergence, colonization and hybridization, thus highlighting the need for rigorous analyses to distinguish between such scenarios.",

Next-­generation DNA sequencing technologies and DNA metabarcoding provide an efficient means for obtaining information available in scat samples. We used multifaceted DNA metabarcoding (MDM) of noninvasively collected bat guano pellets from a Myotis lucifugus colony on Fort Drum Military Installation, New York, USA, and from two mixed-­species bat roosts on Fort Huachuca Military Installation, Arizona, USA, to identify attributes such as bat species composition, sex ratios, diet, and the presence of pathogens and parasites. We successfully identified bat species for nearly 98% of samples from Fort Drum and 90% of samples from Fort Huachuca, and identified the sex for 84% and 67% of samples from these same locations, respectively. Species and sex identification matched expectations based on prior censuses of bat populations utilizing those roosts, though samples from some species were more or less common than anticipated within Fort Huachuca roosts. Nearly 62% of guano samples from Fort Drum contained DNA from Pseudogymnoascus destructans, where bats with wing damage from White-­nose Syndrome were commonly observed. Putative dietary items were detected in a majority of samples from insectivorous bats on Fort Drum (81%) and Fort Huachuca (63%). A minority of guano samples identified as the nectarivorous Leptonycteris yerbabuenae (28%) provided DNA sequences from putative forage plant species. Finally, DNA sequences from both putative ecto-­and endoparasite taxa were detected in 35% and 56% of samples from Fort Drum and Fort Huachuca, respectively. This study demonstrates that the combination of noninvasive sampling, DNA metabarcoding, and sample and locus multiplexing provide a wide array of data that are otherwise difficult to obtain.",

A notable example of this success is the elimination of canine rabies virus variant from the United States and many other countries. However, increased international travel and trade can pose risks for rapid, long-distance movements of ill or infected persons or animals. Such travel and trade can result in human exposures to rabies virus during travel or transit and could contribute to the re-introduction of canine rabies variant or transmission of other viral variants among animal host populations. We present a review of travel- and trade-associated rabies events that highlight international public health obligations and collaborative opportunities for rabies prevention and control in an age of global travel. Rabies is a fatal disease that warrants proactive coordination among international public health and travel industry partners (such as travel agents, tour companies and airlines) to protect human lives and to prevent the movement of viral variants among host populations.",

A self-administered survey was mailed to 6033 randomly selected Sumter County addresses. The survey inquired about household exposures to bats and respondents’ rabies knowledge. Surveys were returned by mail for descriptive analysis. Of 597 respondents, 3.5% (21/597) reported having bats living in (2.8% or 17/597) or entering their homes (2.5% or 15/597) during 2010–2012. Respondents generally understood that mammals transmit rabies virus through bites, but were less aware of the severity of rabies illness and modern post-exposure vaccine administration. Respondents were unsure about how to exclude bats from homes and ranked highly both healthcare and non-healthcare entities as preferred resources for obtaining assistance with bat-related concerns. We found potential for human exposures to bats in Sumter County households and gaps in citizen knowledge of rabies and bat exclusion. Public health ofﬁcials should engage non-healthcare partners in assistance disseminating rabies educational materials and for providing appropriate referral for persons potentially exposed to bats.",

These ‘recall’ data often form the basis of wildlife sustainability assessments and, ultimately, policy decisions and management actions, but they are highly vulnerable to bias, particularly when the behavior of interest has strong temporal variation. Here, we investigate bias in recalls of wildlife consumption in rural Madagascar by comparing oral recalls collected monthly and annually from male heads of household with daily diet diaries maintained by female heads of household. Daily diet calendars collected from 28 households were assumed to be the measure of true consumption and were used to validate the recalled information. While we found little interhousehold variation in accuracy of responses, we found a tendency for recalls to overreport rates of wildlife consumption. Estimating the annual frequency of rare and/or seasonal events was quantiﬁed more accurately by recalls of the prior year than by extrapolation of recalls of the prior month. We conclude that monthly variation in consumption rate leads to predictable errors in estimation of the annual consumption rate. Local consumption of wildlife has large temporal variability, reﬂecting human preference or the underlying life cycles of animals being consumed. Accurate assessment of consumption rates therefore requires determining an appropriate recall period by taking into account the temporal variability and frequency of the events in question.",

At least two analytical approaches to solving this problem have been utilized: (1) simultaneous analysis of molecular sequence and morphological data with fossil taxa included as terminals in the analysis, and (2) the molecular scaffold approach, in which morphological data are analyzed over a molecular backbone (with constraints that force extant taxa into positions suggested by sequence data). The perceived obstacles to including fossil taxa directly in simultaneous analyses of morphological and molecular sequence data with extant taxa include: (1) that fossil taxa are missing the molecular sequence portion of the character data; (2) that morphological characters might be misleading due to convergence; and (3) character weighting, specifically how and whether to weight characters in the morphological partition relative to characters in the molecular sequence data partition. The molecular scaffold has been put forward as a potential solution to at least some of these problems. Using examples of simultaneous analyses from the literature, as well as new analyses of previously published morphological and molecular sequence data matrices for extant and fossil Chiroptera (bats), we argue that the simultaneous analysis approach is superior to the molecular scaffold approach, specifically addressing the problems to which the molecular scaffold has been suggested as a solution. Finally, the application of phylogenetic hypotheses including fossil taxa (whatever their derivation) to the study of morphological character evolution is discussed, with special emphasis on scenarios in which fossil taxa are likely to be most enlightening: (1) in determining the sequence of character evolution; (2) in determining the timing of character evolution; and (3) in making inferences about the presence or absence of characteristics in fossil taxa that may not be directly observable in the fossil record.",

            "abstractNote": "Olive (Olea europaea L.) farming is one of the most widespread agricultural practice throughout the Mediterranean basin. Current trends even predict an increase in land area devoted to olive farms as well as the intensiﬁcation of farming practices. However, knowledge of the effects of olive farming on animal species still remains elusive and conservation and management guidelines for the relevant stakeholders are therefore urgently needed. Here, we investigate community composition and activity patterns of insectivorous bats in Mediterranean olive monocultures in Southern Portugal. Bats surveys were carried out in three types of olive farms representing increasing levels of management intensity: (1) traditional olive farms, managed with few or no chemical inputs or manual labor; (2) semiintensive olive farms, which share certain characteristics with traditional plantations, but are more intensively managed; (3) intensive olive farms, which are managed with high and frequent chemical inputs, and highly mechanized systems. We found differences in species richness and activity levels between farming practices. Both the number of species and foraging activity declined with increasing management intensity. However, olive groves as a whole showed a lower number of species compared with the regional species pool and extremely low activity levels, suggesting that large and homogeneous olive monocultures may serve more as commuting areas than true foraging habitats for bats. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study explicitly demonstrating the pervasive impact of olive farming on the community composition and activity levels of insectivorous bats. In the face of an even-increasing proportion of land surface devoted to olive farming in Mediterranean landscapes, our ﬁndings are therefore of great concern. We suggest that increasing habitat heterogeneity would contribute to preserve the community composition and ecological functionality of insectivorous bats in extensive olive monocultures.",

We hypothesised that the most important determining variables would not vary between different forest habitats and that social constraints may play a role in limiting commuting distances between roosting and foraging sites. Altogether 11 post-lactating adult females were radio-tracked in two predominantly oak forest habitats, where both potential roost and tree stand characteristics differed. We recorded 18 roosts; the distances between occupied roosts and commuting distances to foraging areas were measured. Within a 0.1 ha wide plot centred on each roost, a total of 17 habitat variables were recorded. Regardless of the different habitat structure (canopy closure, stand density) and roost-site availability, tracked females selected tree hollows with similar dimensions. The size of both roosting and foraging areas did not differ between habitats. We suggest that protection from predators and social constraints may determine the spatial distribution of Bechstein‟s bat roosts.",

            "abstractNote": "Multimicrophone array techniques offer crucial insight into bat echolocation, yet they severely undersample the environments bats operate in as they are limited in geographic placement and mobility. UAVs are excellent candidates to greatly increase the environments in which such arrays can be deployed, but the impact of UAV noise on recording quality and the UAV's behavioral impact on the bats may affect usability. We developed a UAV-­borne multimicrophone setup capable of recording bat echolocation across diverse environments. We quantify and mitigate the impact of UAV noise on the recording setup and test the recording capability of the array by recording four common Danish bat species: Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Myotis daubentonii, Eptesicus serotinus, and Nyctalus noctula. The UAV produces substantial noise at ultrasonic frequencies relevant to many bat species. However, suspending the array 30 m below the UAV attenuates the noise to levels below the self-­noise of our recording system at 20 kHz and above, and we successfully record and acoustically localize all four bat species. The behavioral impact of the UAV is minimal as all four species approached the array to within 1 m and all emitted recordable feeding buzzes. UAV-­ borne multimicrophone arrays will allow us to quantify bat echolocation in hitherto unexplored habitats and provide crucial insight into how bats operate their sonar across their entire natural habitat.",

            "abstractNote": "Several studies have suggested SARS-CoV-2 originated from a viral ancestor in bats, but whether transmission occurred directly or via an intermediary host to humans remains unknown. Concerns of spillover of SARS-CoV-2 into wild bat populations are hindering bat rehabilitation and conservation efforts in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Current protocols state that animals cared for by individuals who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be released into the wild and must be isolated to reduce the risk of transmission to wild populations. Here, we propose a reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-based protocol for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, using fecal sampling. Bats from the United Kingdom were tested following suspected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and tested negative for the virus. With current UK and international legislation, the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild animals is becoming increasingly important, and protocols such as the one developed here will help improve understanding and mitigation of SARS-CoV-2 in the future.",

While high‐resolution observations of activity patterns can provide insights into the ecology of animal species, few methods are able to measure the activity of individuals of small taxa in their natural environment. We present a novel approach in which a combination of automatic radiotracking and machine learning is used to distinguish between active and passive behaviour in small vertebrates fitted with lightweight transmitters (<0.4 g).\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We used a dataset containing >3 million signals from very‐high‐frequency (VHF) telemetry from two forest‐dwelling bat species (\n                    Myotis bechsteinii\n                    [\n                    n\n                     = 52] and\n                    Nyctalus leisleri\n                    [\n                    n\n                     = 20]) to train and test a random forest model in assigning either active or passive behaviour to VHF‐tagged individuals. The generalisability of the model was demonstrated by recording and classifying the behaviour of tagged birds and by simulating the effect of different activity levels with the help of humans carrying transmitters. The model successfully classified the activity states of bats as well as those of birds and humans, although the latter were not included in model training (F1 0.96–0.98).\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We provide an ecological case‐study demonstrating the potential of this automated monitoring tool. We used the trained models to compare differences in the daily activity patterns of two bat species. The analysis showed a pronounced bimodal activity distribution of\n                    N. leisleri\n                    over the course of the night while the night‐time activity of\n                    M. bechsteinii\n                    was relatively constant. These results show that subtle differences in the timing of species' activity can be distinguished using our method.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Our approach can classify VHF‐signal patterns into fundamental behavioural states with high precision and is applicable to different terrestrial and flying vertebrates. To encourage the broader use of our radiotracking method, we provide the trained random forest models together with an R package that includes all necessary data processing functionalities. In combination with state‐of‐the‐art open‐source automated radiotracking, this toolset can be used by the scientific community to investigate the activity patterns of small vertebrates with high temporal resolution, even in dense vegetation.",

Evidence suggests that L. nivalis follows the blooms of paniculate agave plants (genus Agave, subgenus Agave). Paniculate agave inﬂorescences are adapted to attract bats, and studies have indicated that Leptonycteris spp. played a key role in Agave speciation. We test the hypothesis of the Agave migratory corridor by (1) modelling the distribution of the relevant Agave species; and (2) testing whether bat records are signiﬁcantly related to Agave species richness as predicted by our models.",

            "abstractNote": "Measures of traits are the basis of functional biological diversity. Numerous works consider mean species-level measures of traits while ignoring individual variance within species. However, there is a large amount of variation within species and it is increasingly apparent that it is important to consider trait variation not only between species, but also within species. Mammals are an interesting group for investigating trait-based approaches because they play diverse and important ecological functions (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal, predation, grazing) that are correlated with functional traits. Here we compile a data set comprising morphological and life history information of 279 mammal species from 39,850 individuals of 388 populations ranging from À5.83 to À29.75 decimal degrees of latitude and À34.82 to À56.73 decimal degrees of longitude in the Atlantic forest of South America. We present trait information from 16,840 individuals of 181 species of non-volant mammals (Rodentia, Didelphimorphia, Carnivora, Primates, Cingulata, Artiodactyla, Pilosa, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla) and from 23,010 individuals of 98 species of volant mammals (Chiroptera). The traits reported include body mass, age, sex, reproductive stage, as well as the geographic coordinates of sampling for all taxa. Moreover, we gathered information on forearm length for bats and body length and tail length for rodents and marsupials. No copyright restrictions are associated with the use of this data set. Please cite this data paper when the data are used in publications. We also request that researchers and teachers inform us of how they are using the data.",

            "abstractNote": "Mammals are threatened worldwide, with  26% of all species being included in the IUCN threatened categories. This overall pattern is primarily associated with habitat loss or degradation, and human persecution for terrestrial mammals, and pollution, open net fishing, climate change, and prey depletion for marine mammals. Mammals play a key role in maintaining ecosystems functionality and resilience, and therefore information on their distribution is crucial to delineate and support conservation actions. MAMMALS IN PORTUGAL is a publicly available data set compiling unpublished georeferenced occurrence records of 92 terrestrial, volant, and marine mammals in mainland Portugal and archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira that includes 105,026 data entries between 1873 and 2021 (72% of the data occurring in 2000 and 2021). The methods used to collect the data were: live observations/captures (43%), sign surveys (35%), camera trapping (16%), bioacoustics surveys (4%) and radiotracking, and inquiries that represent less than 1% of the records. The data set includes 13 types of records: (1) burrows j soil mounds j tunnel, (2) capture, (3) colony, (4) dead animal j hair j skulls j jaws, (5) genetic confirmation, (6) inquiries, (7) observation of live animal (8), observation in shelters, (9) photo trapping j video, (10) predators diet j pellets j pine cones/nuts, (11) scat j track j ditch, (12) telemetry and (13) vocalization j echolocation. The spatial uncertainty of most records ranges between 0 and 100 m (76%). Rodentia (n =31,573) has the highest number of records followed by Chiroptera (n = 18,857), Carnivora (n = 18,594), Lagomorpha (n = 17,496), Cetartiodactyla (n = 11,568) and Eulipotyphla (n = 7008). The data set includes records of species classified by the IUCN as threatened (e.g., Oryctolagus cuniculus [n = 12,159], Monachus monachus [n = 1,512], and Lynx pardinus [n = 197]). We believe that this data set may stimulate the publication of other European countries data sets that would certainly contribute to ecology and conservation-related research, and therefore assisting on the development of more accurate and tailored conservation management strategies for each species.

Here, we investigated how bats respond to the motion-triggered lighting of a bicycle path, an infrastructure that is increasingly being built to support human mobility. We measured the acoustic activity of bats in relation to the activity of LED lights. The responses of bats varied during the night and between functional guilds: Edge-space foraging bats avoided LED lighting, but the response was less clear during early and late night. Open-space foraging and narrow-space foraging bats avoided the LED lighting, especially late at night. The foraging intensity remained relatively stable across the night for bats of all guilds. We conclude that the motion-sensitive LED lighting of bicycle paths induces a guild-specific avoidance response in bats, which could be mitigated by shorter lighting periods.",

High-intensity echolocating species that used shorter, broadband signals and had shorter, broader wings (Pteronotus macleayii, Pteronotus quadridens, Mormoops blainvillii) foraged most in edge habitats, but differed in timing of peak activity. P. macleayii and M. blainvillii differed in diet, but low sample size precluded diet analysis for P. quadridens. High-intensity echolocating species that used longer, more narrowband signals and had longer, narrower wings (Molossus molossus, Tadarida brasiliensis) foraged most in open areas and differed in diet from the other species. Two disparate species were most active in clutter (dense vegetation). Pteronotus parnellii used high-duty-cycle echolocation apparently specialized for detecting ﬂuttering targets in clutter. Macrotus waterhousii used low-intensity, broadband echolocation calls and presumably uses prey-generated sounds when foraging. These two species also differed in diet. Our data show that differences in morphology and echolocation behaviour coincide with differences in habitat use and diet, resulting in minimal overlap in resource use among species.",

Only one stable population is known, which is located in the Mátra Mountains and has been present each summer since its discovery in 1995. Except for this population, the species is rarely found in other locations. Radio-tracking resulted in the finding of 13 roosting trees, which were exclusively beeches (Fagus sylvatica) in a montane beech forest. The largest roosting group consisted of more than 50 individuals. Sex ratio was highly female biased; adult males have rarely been found in the country. Lactating females and juveniles were captured regularly, which indicates the presence of a stable nursing population in the country. In Hungary, the main threat to N. lasiopterus is likely to be the logging of old beech forests. Further research is needed to draw a better picture of the Hungarian population of the species and strengthen the conservation of this magnificent bat.",

            "abstractNote": "Billions of birds migrate at night over North America each year. However, few studies have described the phenology of these movements, such as magnitudes, directions, and speeds, for more than one migration season and at regional scales. In this study, we characterize density, direction, and speed of nocturnally migrating birds using data from 13 weather surveillance radars in the autumns of 2010 and 2011 in the northeastern USA. After screening radar data to remove precipitation, we applied a recently developed algorithm for characterizing velocity profiles with previously developed methods to document bird migration. Many hourly radar scans contained windborne “contamination,” and these scans also exhibited generally low overall reflectivities. Hourly scans dominated by birds showed nightly and seasonal patterns that differed markedly from those of low reflectivity scans. Bird migration occurred during many nights, but a smaller number of nights with large movements of birds defined regional nocturnal migration. Densities varied by date, time, and location but peaked in the second and third deciles of night during the autumn period when the most birds were migrating. Migration track (the direction to which birds moved) shifted within nights from south-­southwesterly to southwesterly during the seasonal migration peaks; this shift was not consistent with a similar shift in wind direction. Migration speeds varied within nights, although not closely with wind speed. Airspeeds increased during the night; groundspeeds were highest between the second and third deciles of night, when the greatest density of birds was migrating. Airspeeds and groundspeeds increased during the fall season, although groundspeeds fluctuated considerably with prevailing winds. Significant positive correlations characterized relationships among bird densities at southern coastal radar stations and northern inland radar stations. The quantitative descriptions of broadscale nocturnal migration patterns presented here will be essential for biological and conservation applications. These descriptions help to define migration phenology in time and space, fill knowledge gaps in avian annual cycles, and are useful for monitoring long-t­erm population trends of migrants. Furthermore, these descriptions will aid in assessing potential risks to migrants, particularly from structures with which birds collide and artificial lighting that disorients migrants.",

No evidence for the occurrence of such inﬂuenza viruses was found. Further attempts towards a more comprehensive evaluation of the role of bats in the ecology and epidemiology of inﬂuenza viruses should be based on more intense monitoring efforts. However, given the protected status of bats, not only in Europe, such activities need to be embedded into existing pathogen-monitoring programs.",

            "abstractNote": "Data papers and open databases have revolutionized contemporary science, as they provide the long-needed incentive to collaborate in large international teams and make natural history information widely available. Nevertheless, most data papers have focused on species occurrence or abundance, whereas interactions have received much less attention. To help fill this gap, we have compiled a georeferenced data set of interactions between 93 bat species of the family Phyllostomidae (Chiroptera) and 501 plant species of 68 families. Data came from 169 studies published between 1957 and 2007 covering the entire Neotropical Region, with most records from Brazil (34.5% of all study sites), Costa Rica (16%), and Mexico (14%). Our data set includes 2571 records of frugivory (75.1% of all records) and nectarivory (24.9%). The best represented bat genera are Artibeus (28% of all records), Carollia (24%), Sturnira (10.1%), and Glossophaga (8.8%). Carollia perspicillata (187), Artibeus lituratus (125), Artibeus jamaicensis (94), Glossophaga soricina (86), and Artibeus planirostris (74) were the bat species with the broadest diets recorded based on the number of plant species. Among the plants, the best represented families were Moraceae (17%), Piperaceae (15.4%), Urticaceae (9.2%), and Solanaceae (9%).",

The cases of partial and complete albinism in R. hipposideros reported so far are reviewed; all records were made in Central Europe in the Czech and Slovak territories. Also a copulating pair of R. hipposideros was documented and photographed. Unlike hibernating individuals, the bats were alert, in dorso-ventral contact with the male biting his mate’s dorsal fur.",

The four habitats represented a disturbance gradient: active cornfield, ten-year-old abandoned cornfield, cacao plantation, and forest. Using seed traps examined before sunrise (0400 h) and before sunset (1800 h), we compared volant vertebrate seed dispersal, assuming that seeds found at the end of the night were dispersed by bats and those found at the end of the day were dispersed by birds. We did not find seeds from other frugivores such as monkeys or opossums. In all habitats bats dispersed more seeds than birds. In most months bats also dispersed more seeds than birds, except in December when no seeds were found in the traps. Bats also consistently dispersed more species of seeds than birds, although a x 2 comparison showed differences not to be significant. Fifty percent of the spccies represented in the dispersed seeds in all habitats were pioneer species. Cecropia seeds represented a high percentage (up to 87% of those dispersed by bats and up to 83% by birds) of dispersed seeds that fcll in our traps. ’I‘hc influence of bars and birds o n sccondary successional processes is likely to be fundamental for the establishment of vcgetation. Since bats dispersed more seeds than birds (primarily to disturbed areas and consisting primarily of pioneer species), they are likely to play an important role in successional and restoration processes among habitats as structurally and vegetationally different as cornfields, old fields, cacao plantations, and forest.",

Here, we introduce tree\n                    NODF\n                    , a new class of nestedness that takes into account the resemblance of descriptor variables.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    The method is an extension of the\n                    NODF\n                    index and can be applied to systems in which the resemblance of descriptor variables is described by a tree‐like object. Computation of tree\n                    NODF\n                    is similar to\n                    NODF\n                    , but uses branch lengths instead of the sum of species occurrences. In this way, we can calculate a phylo\n                    NODF\n                    for metacommunities if a phylogeny is used to account for differences in phylogenetic diversity (\n                    PD\n                    ) and trait\n                    NODF\n                    if a functional dendrogram constructed from species ecological traits is used to account for the functional diversity (\n                    FD\n                    ) of communities. Similar to\n                    NODF\n                    , tree\n                    NODF\n                    can also be used to assess nestedness among species. In this case, env\n                    NODF\n                    uses a dendrogram describing the resemblance among the environmental conditions of different sites, to test whether rare species occur in a subset of the environmental conditions in the habitats occupied by frequent species.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    tree\n                    NODF\n                    is a composite metric that can be additively partitioned into compositional (S.fraction) and tree‐topology (topo\n                    NODF\n                     = tree\n                    NODF\n                    – S.fraction) components of the descriptor variables. Tests of tree\n                    NODF\n                    and its components can be carried out using null models and, if a hypothetical factor is used to order metacommunity data, permutation tests. We show that tree\n                    NODF\n                    is robust for matrix size and fill, as well as for tree topology.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Finally, we illustrate the use of tree\n                    NODF\n                    by analysing data on Caribbean bats using phylo\n                    NODF\n                    , trait\n                    NODF\n                    and env\n                    NODF\n                    , as well as their composition and tree‐topology components.",

For highly mobile species that actively move among potential breeding locations, coupling survival information with estimates of locational ﬁdelity provides the basis for our understanding of species population dynamics. We studied the effect of time, age and sex class and climatic variables on survival and roost transition probabilities on a population of Egyptian slit-faced bats in Swaziland from 1450 marked individuals from 16 roosts over a 10-year period. We then used variance components analysis to estimate average annual survival and associated temporal process variance. Annual apparent survival varied with sex and age, being highest in adult males and lowest in juvenile females. We did not ﬁnd evidence of survival being inﬂuenced by climatological factors as commonly observed in temperate bats. Roost switching occurred frequently, with more transitions to roosts harboring larger number of bats. Furthermore, the probability of transitioning to another roost was related to its distance from the original roost. The dispersal patterns revealed in this study were consistent with the ﬁssion–fusion dynamics common for colonial bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are the second most diverse mammal order and they provide vital ecosystem functions (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal, and nutrient flux in caves) and services (e.g., crop pest suppression). Bats are also important vectors of infectious diseases, harboring more than 100 different virus types. In the present study, we compiled information on bat communities from the Atlantic Forests of South America, a species-rich biome that is highly threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. The ATLANTIC BATS data set comprises 135 quantitative studies carried out in 205 sites, which cover most vegetation types of the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Forest: dense ombrophilous forest, mixed ombrophilous forest, semideciduous forest, deciduous forest, savanna, steppe, and open ombrophilous forest. The data set includes information on more than 90,000 captures of 98 bat species of eight families. Species richness averaged 12.1 per site, with a median value of 10 species (ranging from 1 to 53 species). Six species occurred in more than 50% of the communities: Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Sturnira lilium, Artibeus fimbriatus, Glossophaga soricina, and Platyrrhinus lineatus. The number of captures divided by sampling effort, a proxy for abundance, varied from 0.000001 to 0.77 individualsÁhÀ1ÁmÀ2 (0.04 Æ 0.007 individualsÁhÀ1ÁmÀ2). Our data set reveals a hyper-dominance of eight species that together that comprise 80% of all captures: Platyrrhinus lineatus (2.3%), Molossus molossus (2.8%), Artibeus obscurus (3.4%), Artibeus planirostris (5.2%), Artibeus fimbriatus (7%), Sturnira lilium (14.5%), Carollia perspicillata (15.6%), and Artibeus lituratus (29.2%).",

            "abstractNote": "The microchiropteran bat family Emballonuridae is widely distributed in archipelagos of the southwestern Paciﬁc, with especially strong representation of genera Emballonura and Mosia. DNA sequences from three segments of the mitochondrial genome were collected from four species of Emballonura and from M. nigrescens to investigate the relationship of genetic differentiation to archipelago biogeography. Specimens of each species formed monophyletic clades in maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Mosia nigrescens was genetically distant to the other four species. The other four studied species formed a monophyletic clade composed of the pairs E. beccarii, E. serii and E. raffrayana, E. semicaudata. Clades within species were strongly concordant with geography, with only two counterexamples (E. semicaudata in Fiji and E. raffrayana in the Solomon Islands) to the general ﬁnding that each island’s population of a species constitutes a monophyletic clade. Genetic results do not agree with current subspeciﬁc designations within M. nigrescens. Samples from Woodlark, Alcester, and Manus Islands are phylogenetically closer to Papuan mainland samples than to Solomon Islands and New Ireland samples supposedly belonging to the same subspecies. Results suggest that Emballonura can establish populations across wide water barriers but does so infrequently. The isolating effect of water barriers is exempliﬁed by the substantial genetic distinctiveness of Solomon Islands and New Ireland populations of both E. raffrayana and M. nigrescens. Absence from New Britain of E. beccarii, E. raffrayana, and E. serii (all known from New Ireland) may also reﬂect effects of water barriers if not due to collecting artifacts.",

Investigating the phylogeography of species complexes can provide insight into these introgressions, and when and where these hybridizations occurred. In this study, we investigate the biogeography of a widely distributed Western Palaearctic bat species complex, namely Myotis nattereri sensu lato. This complex exhibits high genetic diversity and in its western distribution range is composed of deeply diverged genetical lineages. However, little is known about the genetic structure of the eastern populations. We also infer the conservation and taxonomical implications of the identified genetic divergences.",

We evaluated the impact of eucalypt plantations on native bats in a Mediterranean area, taking Portugal as a case study. We compared the overall bat activity, species richness and Kuhl’s bat Pipistrellus kuhlii (the most abundant bat species in the area) activity between eucalypt plantations and native montado habitat, and examined the inﬂuence of stand, landscape and survey variables within plantations on the response variables. A set of 11 plantation stands, three landscape and two survey variables were employed as predictor variables using a zero-inﬂated Poisson generalized linear mixed model. Hawking and generalist bats of the genus Pipistrellus were the most frequently detected species. Bat activity, species richness and P. kuhlii activity were higher in native montado than in any of the eucalypt stands. Mature eucalypt plantations showed the highest bat activity, while clear-cut areas showed the lowest. Generally, within eucalypt stands, complex high-level vegetation structure, from the ground level up to 3 m high, and proximity to water points were associated with higher levels of bat and P. kuhlii activity and species richness. The results suggest that in order to promote bat diversity and activity in exotic eucalypt plantations in the Mediterranean region, it is important to provide a high density of water points, maintain plots of mature plantations and promote understorey clutter.",

These hypotheses, however, have not been tested against a null model of climate-driven postglacial area loss. Here, we use a new Quaternary mammal database and deep-sea bathymetry to estimate species–area relationships (SARs) at present and during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) for bats of the Caribbean, and to model species loss as a function of area loss from rising sea level. Island area was a signiﬁcant predictor of species richness in the Bahamas, Greater Antilles, and Lesser Antilles at all time periods, except for the Lesser Antilles during the LGM. Parameters of LGM and current SARs were similar in the Bahamas and Greater Antilles, but not the Lesser Antilles, which had fewer estimated species during the LGM than expected given their size. Estimated postglacial species losses in the Bahamas and Greater Antilles were largely explained by inferred area loss from rising sea level in the Holocene. However, there were more species in the Bahamas at present, and fewer species in the smaller Greater Antilles, than expected given island size and the end-Pleistocene/early Holocene SARs. Poor fossil sampling and ecological factors may explain these departures from the null. Our analyses illustrate the importance of changes in area in explaining patterns of species richness through time and emphasize the role of the SAR as a null hypothesis in explorations of the impact of novel ecological interactions on extinction.",

The main objective of this research was to investigate, under controlled conditions, seed germination of species from different successional positions as well as to follow seed germination and seedling survival under natural shade in the field. The species studied were Solanum granuloso-leprosum, Trema mirrantha, Cecropia pachystachya. Croton piptocalF, Bauhinia f.$cata subsp. pruinosa, Senna macranthera, Schizolobium parahyba, Piptadenia gonoacantha, Chorisia speciosa, Pseudobombax grandijlorum, Firm guaranitica, Esenbeckia leioratpa, Pachystroma longifolium, Myroxylon peruifprum, and Hymenaea courbaril. Field trials were carried out at Santa Genebra Municipal Reserve, Campinas, SP, Brazil, at the forest edge and in the understory. No significant correlations were detected between successional status and seed size or seed water content. Light-regulated germination was present only in small-seeded species. In field experiments, most species, including the light-sensitive ones, were able to germinate under the canopy, where a low red/far-red ratio predominates. Most species, mainly those of early- and intermediate successional positions, presented low seedling survival rates under shade. Myroxylon peru;ferum was the most shade tolerant species, while S. granuloso-lqrosum, C speciosa, I? gonoacantha, E guaranitica, 7: micrantha, and S. parahyba were the most shade intolerant. These latter species showed little or no survival under the shade conditions.",

Our major objective was to examine differences in prey recovery from bat guano across two different sequencing workflows using the same faecal DNA extracts. We compared results between the Ion Torrent PGM and the Illumina MiSeq with similar library preparations and the same analysis pipeline. We focus on repeatability and provide an R Notebook in an effort towards transparency for future methodological improvements. Full documentation of each step enhances the accessibility of our analysis pipeline. We tagged DNA from insectivorous bat faecal samples, targeted the arthropod cytochrome c oxidase I minibarcode region and sequenced the product on both second-generation sequencing platforms. We developed an analysis pipeline with a high operational taxonomic unit (OTU) clustering threshold (i.e., ≥98.5%) followed by copy number filtering to avoid merging rare but genetically similar prey into the same OTUs. With this workflow, we detected 297 unique prey taxa, of which 74% were identified at the species level. Of these, 104 (35%) prey OTUs were detected by both platforms, 176 (59%) OTUs were detected by the Illumina MiSeq system only, and 17 (6%) OTUs were detected using the Ion Torrent system only. Costs were similar between platforms but the Illumina MiSeq recovered six times more reads and four additional insect orders than did Ion Torrent. The considerations we outline are particularly important for long-term ecological monitoring; a more standardized approach will facilitate comparisons between studies and allow faster recognition of changes within ecological communities.",

In Italy R. mehelyi was thought to be extinct in peninsular Italy, and still occurring in Sardinia (with large colonies) and Sicily (two remnant colonies). For peninsular Italy its presence was reported only for Apulia (SE Italy) but the latest records dated back to the 1960’s. In this note we conﬁrm the presence of this species in the same region for the Zinzulusa Cave (Castro, Lecce).",

Yet, this process has too often been conducted at the cost of airborne biodiversity such as birds and bats. The latter are severely threatened due to deaths by collision at wind turbine. The UNEP/EUROBATS agreement that came into force in 1994 is now ratified by 37 countries; since 2008, it recommends to site wind turbines at least 200 m away from woody edges to decrease bat fatality risks. However, 14 years later we still do not know to what extent this international recommendation has been applied in Europe. We assessed siting distances between woody edges and wind turbines for the largest wind energy producers among the UNEP/EUROBATS parties: the UK, Germany, and France. We show that 61%, 78%, and 56%, respectively, of the installed wind turbines did not comply with UNEP/EUROBATS guidelines, without improvement over time. We identified probable causes of these findings and provided key policy recommendations to achieve compliance to UNEP/EUROBATS guidelines such as better: (i) inclusion in regulatory texts, (ii) notification of the environmental authorities, and (iii) strategic, well‐informed, forward planning of areas suitable for wind turbine development.",

Exemplified by the common vampire bat, we demonstrate the use of metabarcoding to infer predator population structure alongside diet assessments. Growing populations of common vampire bats impact human, livestock and wildlife health in Latin America through transmission of pathogens, such as lethal rabies viruses. Techniques to determine large-scale variation in vampire bat diet and bat population structure would empower locality- and species-specific projections of disease transmission risks. However, previously used methods are not cost-effective and efficient for large-scale applications. Using bloodmeal and faecal samples from common vampire bats from coastal, Andean and Amazonian regions of Peru, we showcase metabarcoding as a scalable tool to assess vampire bat population structure and feeding preferences. Dietary metabarcoding was highly effective, detecting vertebrate prey in 93.2% of the samples. Bats predominantly preyed on domestic animals, but fed on tapirs at one Amazonian site. In addition, we identified arthropods in 9.3% of samples, likely reflecting consumption of ectoparasites. Using the same data, we document mitochondrial geographic population structure in the common vampire bat in Peru. Such simultaneous inference of vampire bat diet and population structure can enable new insights into the interplay between vampire bat ecology and disease transmission risks. Importantly, the methodology can be incorporated into metabarcoding diet studies of other animals to couple information on diet and population structure.",

The colonial roosting sites of I! tonganus were observed over a ten-year period, including two years when severe hurricanes devastated bat populations and destroyed roost trees. Prior to the hurricanes, roosts were located on cliff faces above the ocean or steep mountainsides, locations that were either inaccessible to people or in protected areas where hunting was not allowed. In the years immediately following the hurricanes, I! tongunw colonies split into smaller groups that moved frequently to different locations. Four years after the second hurricane, colonies had coalesced and returned to many of the traditional roosting sites used before the hurricanes. Common tree species in upland and coastal forest were selected as roosts. The isolated locations selected for l? tonganus roosts were apparently the result of hunting pressure on the colonies. The solitary roosts of I! sumoensis were observed during 29 months. Roosting bats were well concealed and hard to detect within the forest; even bats on exposed branches were cryptic. Mature primary forest was favored as roosting habitat. Individual bats used specific branches or trees as roosts and returned to them for up to 29 months. Unlike I! tongunus, people did not alarm roosting I! samoensis easily and some roosts were located near houses and along roads.",

This may be particularly true for ectotherms, where behaviour and physiology (e.g. digestion, responsiveness and activity patterns) are strongly inﬂuenced by thermal conditions of microhabitat retreat sites. Retreat sites selected by south-west carpet pythons (Morelia spilota imbricata) were identiﬁed through radiotracking 46 pythons over 3 years. Tree hollows appear to be a very important resource for pythons: 61% (22 of 36 individuals tracked over winter) used tree hollows as retreat sites (56% of all observations in winter), and remained in hollows for an average of 124 Ϯ 49 (range 34 to 210) days. If pythons did not use tree hollows over winter, they found refuge in one of four alternative microhabitats: low vegetation cover (26% of winter observations), ground cover (10%), on tree branches (6%) or in hollow logs on the ground (2%). We tested whether tree hollows provide a thermally distinct environment compared with alternative microhabitats, but found no difference in minimum, average, maximum or range of temperatures recorded between microhabitats. When within tree hollows over winter, pythons had colder daily average and maximum body temperatures (cf. pythons that used other microhabitats), but this did not give them an energy saving (in terms of body condition scores). Pythons ate very little over winter and we predict that animals sequestered within tree hollows do not access prey at this time. Tree hollows provide a critical refuge over winter when python body temperature is low, and their responsiveness is limited, rendering individuals vulnerable to predation by terrestrial predators (e.g. introduced red fox). Destruction of hollows through ﬁre, land clearing, competition with other fauna species and the signiﬁcant age required for hollows to form in trees all contribute to the decline in availability of this important microhabitat.",

A 3‐cm charcoal layer was dated to 2720±30 cal. a\n              BP\n              and inferred to be Woodland Indian in origin from microscopic inspection and thickness. Pollen and geochemical data showed that bat diets changed in the late Holocene possibly linked to food supply and climate changes.

European bats exemplify the need for successful and cost-effective management for both reasons, often simultaneously. Across Europe, bats are protected, and the concept of Favourable Conservation Status (FCS) is used as a key tool for the assessment and licensing of disruptive actions to populations. However, for efﬁcient decision-making, this assessment requires knowledge on the demographic rates and long-term dynamics of populations. We used capture–mark–recapture to describe demographic rates for the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) at two sites in England and investigate the transition rates between three stages: juveniles, immatures, and breeders. We then use these rates in an individual-based population dynamics model to investigate the expected trajectories for both populations. Our results demonstrate for the ﬁrst time the presence and scale of temporal variation in this species’ demography. We describe the lengthy prereproductive period (3.5 years) that female Serotines experience. Finally, we show how site-speciﬁc variation in demographic rates can produce divergent population trajectories. Effective management of European bat populations can be achieved through the understanding of life histories, and local demographic rates and population dynamics, in order to anticipate the presence of source and sink sites in the landscape. Using the Serotine bat in England, we show that these can be obtained from rigorous and systematic studies of long-term demographic datasets.",

            "abstractNote": "Most tropical plants produce fleshy fruits that are dispersed primarily by vertebrate frugivores. Behavioral disparities among vertebrate seed dispersers could influence patterns of seed distribution and thus forest structure. This study investigated the relative importance of arboreal seed dispersers and seed predators on the initial stage of forest organization-seed deposition. We asked the following questions: (1) To what degree do arboreal seed dispersers influence the species richness and abundance of the seed rain? and (2) Based on the plant species and strata of the forest for which they provide dispersal services, do arboreal seed dispersers represent similar or distinct functional groups? To answer these questions, seed rain was sampled for 12 months in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon. Seed traps representing five percent of the crown area were erected below the canopies of 90 trees belonging to nine focal tree species: 3 dispersed by monkeys, 3 dispersed by large frugivorous birds, and 3 wind-dispersed species. Seeds disseminated by arboreal seed dispersers accounted for ca 12 percent of the seeds and 68 percent of the seed species identified in seed traps. Monkeys dispersed more than twice the number of seed species than large frugivorous birds, but birds dispersed more individual seeds. We identified two distinct functional dispersal groups, one composed of large frugivorous birds and one composed of monkeys, drop dispersers, and seed predators. These groups dispersed plants found in different canopy strata and exhibited low overlap in the seed species they disseminated. We conclude it is unlikely that seed dispersal services provided by monkeys could be compensated for by frugivorous birds in the event of their extirpation from Afrotropical forests.",

As the number of electronic herbarium records proliferates, the importance of linking these records to the physical specimens they represent as well as to related records from other sources will intensify. Although a rich and diverse literature has developed over the past decade that addresses the use of specimen identifiers for facilitating linking across the internet, few implementable guidelines or recommended practices for herbaria have been advanced. Here we review this literature with the express purpose of distilling a specific set of recommendations especially tailored to herbarium specimen digitization, curation, and management. We argue that associating globally unique identifiers (\n              GUID\n              s) with physical herbarium specimens and including these identifiers in all electronic records about those specimens is essential to effective digital data curation. We also address practical applications for ensuring these associations.",

Through banding techniques, chromosomes homologies between Carollia perspicillata and Rhinophylla pumilio were not found, possibly because Carollia species have highly rearranged chromosomes. Probably, Rhinophylla is better associated to Phyllostomini tribe. Sex vesicle pairing behavior at the meiotic prophase was analyzed in both species. R. pumilio had a simple sex chromosome system (XX/XY), the XY pair showed an asynchronic behavior compared to the autosomal bivalents. The sex vesicle showes the X and Y pairing in the pseudoautosomal region. Moreover, a folding of the X-asynaptic axis on itself and condensed differentiated axes were also identified. In C. perspicillata, with a multiple sex chromosome system (XY1Y2), the segments Xp-Y1 and Xq-Y2 paired independently from each other. Compared to the autosomes, the sex vesicle showed a precocious pairing behavior. In C. perspicillata, a NOR stained with silver was localized in the X rearranged chromosome. Possibly, this region separates the XY1Y2 trivalent in two independent parts: one involving the X and Y2 autosomal with transcriptional activity, and the other corresponding to the original X and Y sex pair.",

Exclosures were also used to determine the relative importance of vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators. Although species differed significantly in levels of predation, predation of seeds exposed to vertebrates was high (>75%) for all species, while seed predation by invertebrates was lower and more variable. Seed and seedling predation by insects was significantly higher in mature forest, while seed predation by rodents was higher in fallow areas. Other sources of mortality (primarily desiccation) were higher for seeds in fallow areas. The percentage of seeds moved was significantlydifferent among species but not between forests.",

We sampled a wide range of elevations and associated habitat types throughout Belize. Anabat provides an instantaneous output of echolocation call structure with a laptop computer. Select sequences can be saved directly to the hard drive, avoiding extraneous noise and sound distortion commonly associated with tape recorders. To date, 18 of the 37 species known or expected to occur in the study region were identified by recognizable differences in the time-frequency characteristics of echolocation calls. In general, each family is recognizable by call structure patterns and species readily separated by frequency range parameters. Species that commute or forage at high altitudes are not susceptible to capture but are conspicuous by acoustic sampling. Further work is needed to determine limitations of the equipment, establish better sampling procedures, and develop a comprehensive library of vocal signatures incorporating the range of variation inherent in each species. As this work progresses, we predict the addition of hitherto unknown species occurring within the study region.",

Application to crops of pyrethroids such as DTM can result in the of water and fruit consumed by fruit bats having a high pyrethroid content which may be harmful. Therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of short-t­erm oral exposure of the fruit-e­ ating bats (Artibeus lituratus) to two concentrations of DTM (0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg of papaya) on histopathology of the intestine, liver and kidney. The intestine of the animals exposed to both concentrations showed inflammatory infiltrate, degeneration, necrosis and goblet cell hyperplasia as the most frequent pathologies. Besides, the acid mucins showed an increase in the frequency of non-­ viable cells. The liver showed hepatocyte vacuolizatio and nuclear enlargement, as well as inflammatory infiltrate and steatosis. The kidneys of the exposed animals showed and inflammatory infiltrate, benign nephrosclerosis, vacuolization and necrosis. Also, DTM reduced nitric oxide synthesis, decreased glomerular diameter and increased glycogen percentage in the proximal tubules. Our results suggest that acute exposure to DTM at low concentrations has the potential to induce pronounced histopathological changes in vital organs, such as intestine, liver and kidney of fruit-­eating bats.",

We developed Animal Sound Identiﬁer (ASI), a MATLAB software that performs probabilistic classiﬁcation of species occurrences from ﬁeld recordings. Unlike most previous approaches, ASI locates training data directly from the ﬁeld recordings and thus avoids the need of pre-deﬁned reference libraries. We apply ASI to a case study on Amazonian birds, in which we classify the vocalisations of 14 species in 194 504 oneminute audio segments using in total two weeks of expert time to construct, parameterise, and validate the classiﬁcation models. We compare the classiﬁcation performance of ASI (with training templates extracted automatically from ﬁeld data) to that of monitoR (with training templates extracted manually from the Xeno-Canto database), the results showing ASI to have substantially higher recall and precision rates.",

Given that rhinolophids tend to be relatively weak fliers, hence have low vagility, we hypothesized that some specimens attributed to\n              \n                R\n                . arcuatus,\n              \n              but originating from geographically disjunct populations, may in fact represent distinct species.

Careful morphological analysis reveals heretofore cryptic but nevertheless distinct, species‐level morphological differences among specimens derived from geographically isolated locations. Furthermore, molecular data illuminate the existence of several species‐level sequence divergences among specimens heretofore attributed to\n              \n                R\n                . arcuatus\n              \n              .

In this study, we i) explored the degree to which a widespread European bat, namely the common bent-wing bat Miniopterus schreibersii, consumes crop-damaging insects at a continental scale, and ii) tested whether its dietary niche is shaped by the extension and type of agricultural fields. We employed a dual-primer DNA metabarcoding approach to characterize arthropod 16S and COI DNA sequences within bat faecal pellets collected across 16 Southern European localities, to first characterize the bat species’ dietary niche, second measure the incidence of agricultural pests across their ranges and third assess whether geographical dietary variation responds to climatic, landscape diversity, agriculture type and vegetation productivity factors. We detected 12 arthropod orders, among which lepidopterans were predominant. We identified >200 species, 44 of which are known to cause agricultural damage. Pest species were detected at all but one sampling site and in 94% of the analysed samples. Furthermore, the dietary diversity of M. schreibersii exhibited a negative linear relation with the area of intensive agricultural fields, thus suggesting crops restrict the dietary niche of bats to prey taxa associated with agricultural production within their foraging range. Overall, our results imply that M. schreibersii might be a valuable asset for biological pest suppression in a variety of agricultural productions and highlight the dynamic interplay between wildlife and agricultural systems.",

            "abstractNote": "Madagascar has a distinctive fruit bat community consisting of Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, and Rousettus madagascariensis. In this study, we observed fruit bat visits to ﬂowering baobabs (Adansonia suarezensis and Adansonia grandidieri) and kapok trees (Ceiba pentandra) during the austral winter. Eidolon dupreanum was recorded feeding on the nectar of baobabs and kapok, P. rufus was observed feeding on kapok only and no R. madagascariensis were seen. Three mammals species, two small lemurs (Phaner furcifer and Mirza coquereli) and E. dupreanum, made nondestructive visits to ﬂowering A. grandidieri and are therefore all potential pollinators of this endangered baobab. This is the ﬁrst evidence to show that A. grandidieri is bat-pollinated and further demonstrates the close link between fruit bats and some of Madagascar’s endemic plants. Eidolon dupreanum was the only mammal species recorded visiting A. suarezensis and visits peaked at the reported times of maximum nectar concentration. Pteropus rufus visited kapok mostly before midnight when most nectar was available, but E. dupreanum visited later in the night. These differences in timing of foraging on kapok can be explained either by differing distances from the roost sites of each species or by resource partitioning. We advocate increased levels of protection, education awareness, and applied research on both mammal-pollinated baobab species and fruit bats, and suggest that both baobabs and bats are candidate “ﬂagship species” for the threatened dry forests of Madagascar.",

            "abstractNote": "Niche partitioning through foraging is a mechanism likely involved in facilitating the coexistence of ecologically similar and co-occurring animal species by separating their use of resources. Yet, this mechanism is not well understood in flying insectivorous animals. This is particularly true of bats, where many ecologically similar or cryptic species coexist. The detailed analysis of the foraging niche in sympatric, cryptic sibling species provides an excellent framework to disentangle the role of specific niche factors likely involved in facilitating coexistence. We used DNA metabarcoding to determine the prey species consumed by a population of sympatric sibling Rhinolophus euryale and Rhinolophus mehelyi whose use of habitat in both sympatric and allopatric ranges has been well established through radio tracking. Although some subtle dietary differences exist in prey species composition, the diet of both bats greatly overlapped (Ojk = 0.83) due to the consumption of the same common and widespread moths. Those dietary differences we did detect might be related to divergences in prey availabilities among foraging habitats, which prior radio tracking on the same population showed are differentially used and selected when both species co-occur. This minor dietary segregation in sympatry may be the result of foraging on the same prey-types and could contribute to reduce potential competitive interactions (e.g., for prey, acoustic space). Our results highlight the need to evaluate the spatial niche dimension in mediating the cooccurrence of similar insectivorous bat species, a niche factor likely involved in processes of bat species coexistence.",

            "abstractNote": "The high degree of isolation of forest “islands” relative to “continental” forested areas creates a naturally fragmented landscape in the savanna ecosystem. Because fragmentation can affect the intensity and quality of biological interactions (e.g., seed dispersal) we examined the abundance and species richness of seed rain produced by birds and bats in three different parts of forest islands (center, edge, and exterior) located at the Estacio´n Biolo´gica del Beni, Bolivia. Despite the fact that we found higher species density of seeds in the seed rain at the center of forest islands, when comparing species richness corrected for observed differences in density, species richness was higher at the edge of islands. The three parts of the islands did not differ in total number of seeds. Three genera (Byrsonima, Ficus, and Piper) contributed the most seeds to the seed rain. We found differences in the abundance of dispersed seeds probably because of the variation related with the disturbance line, where the savanna matrix interacts with the forest islands. Carollia perspicillata, Carollia brevicauda, and Sturnira lilium were the bats that contributed most to seed dispersal within forest islands, and Schistochlamys melanopis and Tyranneutes stolzmanni were the most important birds. The movement of seeds produced by bats and birds within forest islands of the savanna is crucial to assure the continuity of ecological process and dynamics of these forest islands.",

            "abstractNote": "Lower Central America (LCA) provides a geologically complex and dynamic, richly biodiverse model for studying the recent assembly and diversiﬁcation of a Neotropical biota. Here, we review the growing literature of LCA phylogeography studies and their contribution to understanding the origins, assembly, and diversiﬁcation of the LCA biota against the backdrop of regional geologic and climatic history, and previous biogeographical inquiry. Studies to date reveal that phylogeographical signal within taxa of differing distributions reﬂects a diversity of patterns and processes rivalling the complexities of LCA landscapes themselves. Even so, phylogeography is providing novel insights into regional diversiﬁcation (e.g. cryptic lineage divergences), and general evolutionary patterns are emerging. Congruent multi-taxon phylogeographic breaks are found across the Nicaraguan depression, Chorotega volcanic front, western and central Panama, and the Darie´n isthmus, indicating that a potentially shared history of responses to regional-scale (e.g. geological) processes has shaped the genetic diversity of LCA communities. By contrast, other species show unique demographic histories in response to overriding historical events, including no phylogeographic structure at all. These low-structure or incongruent patterns provide some evidence for a role of local, ecological factors (e.g. long-distance dispersal and gene ﬂow in plants and bats) in shaping LCA communities. Temporally, comparative phylogeographical structuring reﬂects Pliocene–Pleistocene dispersal and vicariance events consistent with the timeline of emergence of the LCA isthmus and its major physiographic features, e.g. cordilleras. We emphasise the need to improve biogeographic inferences in LCA through in-depth comparative phylogeography projects capitalising on the latest statistical phylogeographical methods. While meeting the challenges of reconstructing the biogeographical history of this complex region, phylogeographers should also take up the critical service to society of applying their work to the conservation of its fascinating biodiversity.",

Common phylogenetic history among species, however, may also significantly influence these characters and obscure or enhance perceived patterns of plant syndromes. We analyzed the proportions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose by paper chromatography in the nectar and fruit juice of 525 tropical and subtropical plant species to test whether sugar chemistry was correlated with volant vertebrate pollinator or fruit disperser classes. Samples were taken from Old World and New World species and the calculations kept separate. Kruskal‐Wallis tests of family means showed significant deviations in the percent sucrose content among pollinatorl disperser classes. Mann‐Whitney\n              U\n              ‐tests showed significant differences among nectars of all pollinator classes but fruit juices differed only due to the high sucrose content of megachiropteran dispersed fruits. In addition, sign tests of samples occurring within families showed significant correlations between percentage sucrose content and pollinator/disperser classes. Passerine nectars had low sucrose content. In striking contrast, the nectar of hummingbird flowers had very high sucrose content. The Microchiroptera nectars showed hexose richness with a sucrose content somewhat greater than that of passerine flowers. Megachiroptera flowers showed sucrose‐rich nectars. The results for fruits were comparable to those for nectars. Passerine fruits were hexose dominated, microchiropteran fruits had a sucrose content similar to passerine fruits, and megachiropteran fruits were sucrose‐rich. We speculate on the evolutionary sequence of changes in nectar and fruit juice sugar composition and suggest that future investigations consider the chemistry of other food sources such as pollen and leaves. Only with these additions and other ecological studies can the full interplay of such plant‐animal interactions be anticipated.",

Recent studies in Madagascar however have found some species are present in areas of low forest cover even though their echolocation calls and wing morphology suggest they are able to forage in forests. The present study investigated habitat use and prey selection in two sympatric hipposiderid bats, Triaenops furculus and T. menamena, in the dry southwest of Madagascar. The study colony occupied a cave in limestone karst surrounded by intact spiny bush and several secondary or degraded habitats. We used bat detectors and radiotracking to determine habitat use, and faecal analysis and invertebrate sampling to assess prey selection. Spiny bush, the dominant habitat type in the study area, was used less than predicted from its availability, based on satellite imagery and ground-based habitat mapping. Areas containing large trees were used by radiotracked bats in approximate proportion to their availability and acoustic sampling revealed highest bat activity in this habitat. The radio-tracked individuals used agricultural land more than expected from its availability. A significant difference was found in the proportion of Lepidoptera in the faeces of the two species, with T furculus showing a preference for moths. Triaenops furculus also selected Coleoptera, whereas T. menamena preferred mainly Hemiptera. While this study did not identify a strong association with forested habitats in T. furculus or T. menamena, it remains to be established whether the bats forage in a sub-optimal habitat due to their preference for roosting in the nearby karst caves.",

The most diverse orders are Chiroptera (66 species), Rodentia (36), Carnivora (20), and Cetacea (17); 31 taxa were described based on specimens collected in the state. In regard to the species distributional affinities, most terrestrial are Mesoamerican (70), then Neotropical (36) and Nearctic (31), while for the Order Cetacea there are 13 Tropical and four Antitropical. There are at least 40 species recorded on national or international conservation lists.

            "abstractNote": "During 2014 we studied the diversity of bats in the Masaya Volcano National Park through captures in different types of tree cover; we also characterize the community of insectivorous bats that inhabits the lava tube locally called Tzinacanoste, determining displacement patterns for one of the species. The taxonomic assembly of bats in the park was determined and described, analyzing its conservation potential and the importance it represents (for its environmental services) for the sustainable production areas around the Masaya volcano. In total 29 species were identified (26.3% of the total species identified in Nicaragua) belonging to 5 families. The closed forest presented the highest species richness with 18, and a third of these were exclusive to this type of forest; unlike the open area for public use, which presented minimum values with four species. Four species are of conservation and research interest, three of the family Phyllostomidae (subfamily Phyllostominae), Micronycteris microtis, Micronycteris schmidtorum and Lophostoma brasiliense, and a species of Mormoopidae: Mormoops megalophylla, whose subspecies M. megalophylla megalophylla, presents the southern limit of world distribution in this park. It is also important to consider in the conservation plans the four species associated with the dry forest, which in the country are basically distributed in the Pacific region: Balantiopteryx plicata, Pteronotus davyi, Glossophaga leachii and Carollia subrufa. The results demonstrate the importance of the Masaya Volcano National Park as an area with potential for the conservation and research of bats.",

To increase the information about bat communities in Cuevas de Talgua, we did an inventory in the zone. We used capture technique with mist nets. Furthermore, we recorded with a SongMeter2. We identify eight species of bat. Carollia perspicillata was the species with more capture frequency. The sound record allows us to identify to Pteronotus mesoamericanus. Many of the species found in the area are of vital importance to the functioning of the dry forest. They fulfill the roles of seed dispersers and pest controllers.",
