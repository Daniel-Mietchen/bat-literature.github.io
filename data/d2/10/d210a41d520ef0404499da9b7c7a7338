The new data are noteworthy considering the general scarcity of the species in South Africa, and especially as the Gauteng records are the first published in about six decades. These locations are important roosts. They therefore rank as focal conservation targets for C. percivali, in addition to their high species richness. The status of other known C. percivali colonies is also updated, with additional comments on the roosting habits and sensitive temperament of this vulnerable species.",

Berg (Moraceae), a threatened wind-pollinated dioecious African tree, with typically low density (~10 adults/km2). Eight microsatellite markers were used to type 287 individuals in four Cameroonian populations characterized by different habitats and tree densities. Differentiation among populations was very low. Two populations in more open habitat did not display any correlation between genetic relatedness and spatial distance between individuals, whereas significant SGS was detected in two populations situated under continuous forest cover. SGS was weak with a maximum Sp-statistic of 0.006, a value in the lower quartile of SGS estimates for trees in the literature. Using a stepwise approach with Bayesian clustering methods, we demonstrated that SGS resulted from isolation by distance and not colonization by different gene pools. Indirect estimates of gene dispersal distances ranged from sigma-g = 1 to 7.1 km, one order of magnitude higher than most estimates found in the literature for tropical tree species. This result can largely be explained by life-history traits of the species. Milicia excelsa exhibits a potentially wide-ranging wind-mediated pollen dispersal mechanism as well as very efficient seed dispersal mediated by large frugivorous bats. Estimations of gene flow suggested no major risk of inbreeding because of reduction in population density by exploitation. Different strategy of seed collection may be required for reforestation programmes among populations with different extent of SGS.",

We examined 458 specimens from 52 species in the four study areas. Carlos A. Madrazo was the site with more species richness (n= 41) and also has the less disturbed vegetation, followed by Agua Dulce (n= 37) that presents some orchards that had changed the natural vegetation, and Jalapita (n= 28) and El Espino (n= 14), the areas with the most alteration in their vegetation. The differences found in the distribution of the species in the four areas indicate that most species prefer to inhabit the less disturbed areas with favorable conditions for their survival, suggesting that disturbance reduced the number of species in the studied zones. In Southeastern Mexico, Tabasco and Veracruz are among the states with the most disturbed areas in which the original vegetation has been substituted by grass. It is imperative that the authorities responsible for the conservation of species and use of the land implement a plan to educate local people on the sustainable use of natural resources so their protection and management can be achieved.",

We identified a minimum of 184 individuals from 2 orders, 3 families and 8 species of mammals. The greatest number of prey was from hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), which represented 83.69% of the total individuals and 84.68% of the biomass of the sample. From the other 7 species included in the pellets, 3 were very uncommon species: the cozumelan golden bat (Mimon cozumelae), the false vampire bat (Vampyrum spectrum), and the Peter’s climbing rat (Tylomys nudicaudus). Bats represented 2.17% of prey number and 0.799% of the total biomass estimated in the sample. Comparisons of these results with the estimated abundances by standard trapping methods show differences. These results corroborate a general pattern of barn owl opportunistic predation over the locally most abundant species and bats as rare prey.",

This study presents a systematic review complemented by new data on the diversity of flea species and host associations in Algeria. 198 mammals were examined, including previously understudied hosts such as sheep, red foxes, fennec foxes, and golden African wolves. Of these animals, 108 (54.55%) were infested with fleas. Overall, 1.906 fleas belonging to seven species (Archaeopsylla erinacei s.l., Ctenocephalides felis, C. canis, Nosopsyllus fasciatus, Pariodontis riggenbachi, Pulex irritans, Xenopsylla cheopis) were identified, originating from seven provinces across Algeria. Statistical analysis techniques were employed to process the data, including descriptive statistics, statistical tests, and principal component analysis (PCA).",

Several Cryptosporidium genotypes have been described in bats worldwide, suggesting that bats are infected by host-specific Cryptosporidium spp. To date, there are no published reports about Cryptosporidium spp. in bats from Colombia. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the presence and molecular diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. in Colombian bats.\nMethods  A total of 63 gut samples from three bat species served for molecular detection of Cryptosporidium spp. 18S rDNA gene by qPCR. The sequenced amplicons were used in subsequent phylogenetic analyses to identify them as species or genotypes.\nResults  Cryptosporidium spp. qPCR detection occurred in 9.5% (6/63) of bat intestines, and four sequences represented two new genotypes, called Cryptosporidium bat genotypes XIX and XX, were identified.\nConclusions  This study describes the detection of two novel Cryptosporidium bat genotypes, in two species of bats from a region of Colombia, requiring further studies to determine the relationhip between Cryptosporidium and bats in Colombia.",

In fact, the only available distribution records for several species are their type localities. The purpose of this paper is to broaden the knowledge of the Indonesian group.\nMethods  Hosts and chiggers were captured from April 2018 to March 2020 in Bali and Nusa Penida Islands in Indonesia by using standard bat-capturing and parasite-collecting methods. A list of bat-infesting chiggers in Indonesia was compiled by searching the public databases using specific keywords.\nResults  When compared with already published data on type specimens, the physical measurements and morphology of Whartonia diosi, W. maai and Grandjeana sinensis revealed only minor differences that fell within intraspecific variability of the mentioned species. Two species (W. diosi and G. sinensis) are recorded here for the first time outside of their type localities (Panay Island in the Philippines and China) and, in both cases, represent the first records for Indonesia. The checklist summarizes all 16 species in 9 genera of bat-infesting chiggers collected from 12 bat species belonging to 5 families all collected on 8 Indonesian islands.\nConclusion  Indonesia comprises more than 17,000 islands, is home to over 200 bat species, and harbors hundreds of still undiscovered caves. With such a huge potential for chigger diversity and endemism, it is likely that our results document only a fraction of the actual diversity.",

A total of 654 bats belonging to the families Phyllostomidae, Noctilionidae, Molossidae, Vespertilionidae and Emballonuridae were captured. Only 136 bats of nine genera and 11 species were parasitised. Periglischrus iheringi Oudemans was the most abundant mite species, and this prevalence may be related to the low degree of host specificity of this species and due to the broad geographical distribution of its hosts. The greatest mean intensity was found to Periglischrus torrealbai Machado-Allison on Phyllostomus discolor Wagner (Phyllostomidae) and Periglischrus tonatii Herrin and Tipton associated with Lophostoma silviculum d’Orbigny (Phyllostomidae), which also had the highest prevalence of infestation.",

The patterns of abundance differed greatly among parasite species but total parasite load was markedly higher in pregnant females in spring and early summer and lower in solitary males. On average, 90% of bats were infested by Eyndhovenia sp. with a mean intensity of 13.79 individuals per bat. Penicillidia sp. and one species from Streblidae were found in 66.7% and 11.49% of bats with parasite load of 2.31 and 1.8 parasite per bat, respectively. Using ratio of forearm length to body mass as an indication of bat health the correlation coefficient between parasite load and the health indicator was 0.002 for males and 0.06 for females indicating that parasite load has no apparent impact on bat’s health.",

We analysed the effect of canopy closure on emergence time in Barbastella barbastellus in a mountainous area of central Italy. We used radio-tracking to locate roosts and ﬁlmed evening emergence. Comparisons were made between roosts in open areas and those in dense forest. Median emergence time and illuminance were correlated. Moreover, from pregnancy to late lactation bats emerged progressively earlier, probably because of the exceptionally high wing loading affecting pregnant bats and the high energy demand of lactation. A signiﬁcant inﬂuence of canopy closure on median emergence time was revealed after adjusting for the effects of light and reproductive state. Bats in open habitat emerged later than those roosting beneath closed canopy. In cluttered habitats, predators relying on vision may ﬁnd it more difﬁcult to detect and catch bats at light levels which would offer more chances of success when attacking prey in open habitats. Bats in dense forest are less vulnerable to predators and may take advantage of an earlier emergence by prolonging foraging. Although more vulnerable, lactating females roosting at open sites may beneﬁt from warmer roosting conditions. Roosts in dense forest may be preferred under intense predation pressure. Forest management should favour canopy heterogeneity to provide bats with a range of roosting conditions. Our work emphasises the role of a ﬁnegrained spatial scale in the roosting ecology of forest bats.",

(b.) teucomelas, captured, respectively, in the Swiss Alps and in the Kirghiz Tien Shian and Pamir mountains (central Asia) was investigated through faecal analysis. Location of hunting habitats and data on foraging behaviour of Swiss barbastelle bats were obtained from radiotracking. In either area, ca. 99% of prey by volume consisted of Lepidoptera. The regular occurrence of one small arctiid species in the diet of Swiss barbastelles, as well as the predominance (84%) of tympanate moths among the Lepidoptera sampled at foraging sites suggest that B. barbastellus could prey to a large extent on smaller tympanate moths. Observations of foraging bats showed that, in the study area, barbastelles behaved as typical aerialhawking bat species, although they hunted exclusively just above the forest canopy. This aerial-hawking bat species has seemingly evolved a peculiar foraging technique to overcome the defence system of its probable tympanate prey. The diet of Barbastella appears one of the narrowest among Palaearctic bats. Such a specialization in foraging habits probably points to a higher vulnerability of this species, as compared to other more flexible aerial-hawking bats, to negative changes in the abundance of moth populations. This could explain its current rarity throughout most of Europe.",

A total of 1,390 ectoparasitic flies were collected, belonging to 24 species of Streblidae and one of Nycteribiidae, parasitizing 227 bats of 15 species. Among the species found, the presence of Trichobius sp. on Lonchophylla mordax and the first occurrence of Hershkovitzia sp. on Thyroptera devivoi are highlighted. Lophostoma species presented the highest proportion of individuals with infracommunities and the highest values of parasitological indexes. The high number of bat fly species and hosts, as well as the high values for rates of parasitism and infracommunities, suggests that this area of cerrado has good shelter conditions for these species. The abundance of species and high rates of parasitism detracts from the hypothesis that a higher mean intensity of ectoparasites results from lower competition among flies for hosts in areas with lower ectoparasite species richness. Biogeographical and historical factors of host populations, besides the number of host species and individuals sampled, may contribute to species number and intensity of parasitism.",

Studies have shown that reproductive patterns of Neotropical bats can be seasonal in response to the availability of food resources. For an urban population of insectivorous bats, we studied the annual reproductive activity and the diet of Molossus molossus in Bucaramanga city (Colombia) and its relationship with the precipitation regime of the area. We captured bats monthly using mist nets (October 2016 to September 2017), including dry and wet seasons. The reproductive condition of the males was described by testicular histology and, in females, through the observation of external morphological characters and the analysis of vaginal smears. We also studied the stomach contents of 30 of the captured bats and if they change between seasons. Although not all females were in the same reproductive category each month, at the population level there were two pregnancy peaks in the dry seasons, with parturition at the beginning of the rainy seasons. Cytological analysis of vaginal smears optimized the evaluation of the reproductive stage and indicated that all sampled adult females were reproductive throughout the year. Males were reproductive year-round, showing sperm in seminiferous tubules and ducts. Coleoptera (41.3%) and Hymenoptera (37.7%) were the most important prey; the dietary composition and the amount of food consumed did not change between seasons. Females of this population showed a pattern of bimodal polyestry adjusted to the precipitation pattern of the study area, like other urban and wild populations of the species and other Neotropical insectivorous bats.",

We tested the potential of this assay for the Daubenton’s bat (Myotis daubentonii), a small vespertilionid species (body mass 6–10 g), and we explored the relationship between cortisol and testosterone levels and dawn swarming, a signalling behaviour that occurs during roost-switching. Swarming was recorded using automated PIT-tag readers on the tree roosts of a maternity colony. In spite of absence of biological validation, our preliminary results demonstrate that field conditions of sample storage and small faeces weight do not interfere with hormonal measurement. We also found a positive correlation between individual levels of stress hormone (cortisol faecal metabolites) and swarming behaviour, but this should be interpreted with caution due to methodological shortcomings that need to be improved in future studies.",

            "abstractNote": "Responsible for post-testicular maturation, concentration, protection and sperm storage, the epididymis is an organ that can be easily subdivided into three segments: caput, corpus and cauda. Each epididymal region displays different morphology and functions within the sperm maturation process. Despite the great importance of this organ, studies on its morphology and hormonal control in bats remain scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to morphologically analyze the epididymis of the bat Molossus molossus (Chiroptera: Molossidae), in order to evaluate its morphological and morphometric variations, as well as some aspects of its hormonal control during the annual reproductive cycle. For this purpose, 60 sexually adult males were used in this study, comprising five specimens collected monthly for one year to form 12 sample groups. The epididymis was subjected to morphological, morphometric and immunohistochemical analyses. The results demonstrated that the processes of total testicular regression and posterior recrudescence suffered by M. molossus also impacts the physiology of the epididymis, however, a delay in the epididymal response is seen due to the storage of sperm. Similar to other mammals, the epididymis of M. molossus has a large predominance of principal and basal cells. The epididymal seasonal variations appear to be directly correlated to rainfall and photoperiod, but not to temperature. Meanwhile, epididymal physiology appears to be regulated, at least partially, by the expression of the androgen receptor in epithelial cells, which has agonist effects on cell proliferation.",

            "abstractNote": "An astonishing number of bat fatalities (2,371 belonging to 15 species) were recovered in a provincial surveillance program at wind farms in Cádiz, at the southern tip of Spain, in 2005–2016. We carefully analysed a subset of this sample intending to estimate the true fatality rate in the year 2011, the year for which we had the richest data set (582 fatalities at 38 wind farms). To estimate the true fatality rate, we conducted search-efficiency and scavenger-removal trials in nine wind farms involving 122 turbines and 289 observed fatalities and calculated the searchable surface. An annual fatality rate of 41.1 dead bats per turbine (26.4 per MW) was estimated in the study area using a self-developed estimator due to the singularities of the surveillance program. Our estimator results are lower than those obtained using the Generalized Mortality Estimator (GenEst) developed by U.S. Geological Survey. Estimates of 37,689 or 33,370 fatalities were made according to the province's number of turbines or MW in 2011. Some areas have registered the highest fatality rates ever recorded for bats in wind turbines anywhere globally, even more so because we have been conservative. There is an urgent need for efficient preventive and mitigation measures at wind farms in risky landscapes and with a high rate of bat fatalities, but trials are also needed to know how well the post-operational monitoring is done and how far it is from reality. Clearly, current official post-construction surveillance programs are inefficient for searching bats and therefore mask a high fatality rate, mainly of sedentary bats.",

            "abstractNote": "When white-nose syndrome arrived in eastern North America, bat colonies declined at an alarming rate and the large-scale mortality events were obvious at caves and mines. However, there is concern that the disease and its impacts will be more difficult to detect in western North America where there are fewer winter roosts with thousands of bats. Thus, documenting and responding to precipitous declines will be more challenging. To allow population-level monitoring, western biologists and land managers need to expand search efforts for colonies. One roosting resource that is under-sampled is cliffs, and although we know bats roost along cliffs, biologists know little about roost-site characteristics or the colonies that reside there. Two methods of identifying bat roosts along cliff systems are to collaborate with rock-climbing citizen scientists who report bat encounters, and another is to conduct rockclimbing surveys for bats. We conducted acoustic surveys, thermal videography, and climber-based surveys along the Front Range of northern Colorado, USA, to find bats and describe their roosting habitat. We climbed 48 routes and located two roosts, and received an additional citizen-science record of a third roost. Bats use cracks that were east facing and approximately 12 m above the ground. Climber-based surveys can locate bats and roosting habitat along cliffs, and identify large colonies to be monitored. Targeting climber-based surveys in areas with recreational-climbing citizen-science records may increase the likelihood of finding bat roosts and bat colonies.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are found as fatalities at most wind energy facilities around the world, creating a challenge for wind developers to predict risk to bats in an area before building a new facility. Bat echolocation activity surveys are the standard method for assessing risk, but their effectiveness has not been demonstrated. Sites with relatively low pre-construction bat activity rates are predicted to yield relatively low post-construction fatality rates (i.e., low risk), and vice-versa. To test this hypothesis, we ran simple linear regressions on bat activity rates and fatality rates from 49 paired pre- and post-construction studies across the United States and Canada. Bat activity rates did not predict bat fatality rates at wind energy facilities by detector height, by call frequency category of bats, or by season (P > 0.10). One possible explanation for the lack of a predictive relationship is that bat activity patterns may change between the pre- and post-construction periods if bats are attracted to turbines. Indeed, we found support that bat activity rates increased across call frequency category and season at four wind facilities that had measured bat activity rates before (0 = 1.89 bat passes/detector-night) and after turbines were built (0 = 4.84 bat passes/detector-night). However, simple linear regressions of postconstruction activity rates and fatality rates from 25 studies found no correlation between activity and fatality rates collected concurrently by detector height (ground, raised, nacelle) or by call frequency category (P > 0.05). We conclude that the current preconstruction survey methods of collecting bat activity rates at proposed wind energy facilities do not provide reliable information on how many bat fatalities there may be once the facility is built, and advocate exploring other methods for assessing risk to bats prior to wind development.",

We hypothesized that diet could influence the morphological characteristics in these two species by means of a more complex intestinal morphology in A. planirostris than in D. ecaudata. The intestines were histologically processed, stained, and analyzed. Despite body mass differences, total intestinal length were almost two folds higher in A. planirostris than in D. ecaudata, and the intestinal coefficient, which quantifies the investment in intestines in relation to the body mass, wasn’t statistically different. Macroscopically, no distinction was observed between the SI and LI, and few differences allowed to distinguish histologically the regions of the SI in both species. We found a typical organization of Peyer’s patches only in D. ecaudata. Enteroendocrine cells were more frequently observed at caudal parts of the small intestine in both species. In A. planirostris, the SI diameter, the thickness of its wall, and the thickness and percentage occupied by the mucosal layer, as well as the wall thickness of its LI, were greater than those in D. ecaudata. Circular folds were observed only in the LI of A. planirostris. We speculate that these differences represent strategies to increase the contact surface available to optimize nutrient uptake in A. planirostris; while the hematophagous feeding habit of D. ecaudata, predominantly proteinaceous and semifluid, has a gut wall characterized with less morphological complexity and specializations; which confirms our hypothesis. Based on the similarities and differences founded, it can be concluded for both species that the reduction in the anatomical structures, associated with the microscopic findings, allows to optimize the absorption of nutrients and water in these bats when compared to other mammals; a similar pattern to that found in other chiropterans.",

Species body mass and their geographical range are positively related to the diversity of food items they consume and consequently with their potential ecological niche occupied. However, the relative weight of these factors to explain diet diversity in mammals is poorly known. Using Artibeina frugivorous bats as a biological model, we evaluate the importance of body mass and ecoregions occupied to explain the diet diversity of these bats. We analyzed our data using phylogenetic correlations and Bayesian statistics techniques. Our results show a stronger phylogenetic correlation between bats’ diet diversity with the number of ecoregions they occupied than with their body mass. These results suggest Neotropical frugivorous bats that occupy different habitats had a major possibility to have a higher diet diversity. In addition, these results are related with the ‘bottom-up’ diet diversity hypothesis that postulates that diet diversity in frugivorous bats is related to ecosystem plant diversity.",

            "abstractNote": "Phyllonycteris poeyi is endemic to Cuba and Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles, and it is among the most common and widespread bats of the Cuban archipelago. This species is an obligate cave dweller and forms the largest aggregations of bats found in Cuban caves; and could be considered a hot cave specialist. This high gregariousness could increase intraspecific competition of food resources. In this study, we examined the diet of P. poeyi at Cueva de los Majáes located in Baconao Biosphere Reserve in the southeastern region of Cuba. We hypothesized sexual diet variation as a way to reduce intraspecific competition. We estimated the percentage volume and frequency of occurrence of different food categories consumed by both sexes, using faecal analysis. Throughout the year, the diet of P. poeyi is a combination of fruits, pollen and insects; fruits of at least 17 plant species and flowers of five species are used by P. poeyi and the most frequent items were pollen of Roystonea regia and fruits of Piper aduncum and Piper umbellata. Insects occurred in the faeces of both sexes and their frequency and volume were low and did not differ between sexes. Although both sexes fed on similar food categories, we found significant variation in diet composition between sexes. Throughout the year, the majority of females mainly consumed fruits while males had preference for floral resources. We did not find differences in the sexes-reproductive season interaction, therefore the differences could not be attributed to changes associated to reproduction energetics. The average volume of fruits and pollen consumed by females were independent of the reproductive season, only significant differences were found in the consumption of insects, being the highest during the reproductive season. We conclude that this dietary partitioning behaviour between sexes of P. poeyi may be a strategy to maintain a high year-round gregariousness that could be critical to the viability of their large colonies in Cuban caves.",

            "abstractNote": "Natterer’s bat Myotis nattereri is one of the least known European bats. Understanding its patterns of movement between roosts is an important aspect of assessing the relative value of different types of roost for conservation of the species. We determined patterns of movement of Natterer’s bat between roosts by radio-tracking successive animals from the same colonies during summer (May to September). For one maternity colony comprising 65 adult females, the attic of a large mediaeval church was the main roost site, accounting for 88% of radio-located bat days. The two other maternity colonies tracked comprised about 35 adult females each and used from 15 to 25 roost sites, some containing multiple roosts. For these two colonies, up to six roost sites per colony accounted for about 80% of bat occupancy days in any one summer and for each colony, roost home ranges for roosts used by subgroups of at least two bats together covered 0.4 km2. Although bats made frequent movements between roosts there was no apparent interchange between adjacent colonies and no overlap in the range used by adjacent colonies. Bats changed roosts every 3.0 days on average, moving 510 m (median) to an alternative roost. They departed late and returned early to roosts. Colonies assembled or disintegrated into larger or smaller groups occupying diverse roosts during summer, but there was high social cohesion between colony members. Bats that separated into subgroups from mid-summer (mid-July) onwards later roosted together again. Natterer’s bat exhibits high behavioural flexibility in the type of roosts used: of two adjacent maternity colonies, one used mostly tree roosts and the other mostly buildings. However, both roosted mainly in roofs during early summer (late May to mid-July). Tree roosts were significantly preferred to those in buildings when ambient external maximum temperatures were ≥ 30°C or mean temperatures fell below 14°C. Natterer’s bat appears to depend on the availability of a number of roosts of different types. Parturition roosts, roosts in heavily timbered barns and roosts within core roosting areas, potentially up to 1.2 km distant from the parturition roost, should have highest conservation priority but conservation management should guard against any roost loss.",

The Taberg and Kleva mines, each with about 1.5 km of accessible passages, have winter populations of 517 and 132 bats, respectively (maximum counts) belonging to six species, the highest numbers known in underground sites in Sweden. Ädelfors is less extensive and has fewer individuals (maximum 22). The two former sites were protected and gated in the 1980’s while the third site still has no formal protection and is subject to disturbance. Generally Daubenton’s bat Myotis daubentonii and the brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus are common species and the numbers are stable. The whiskered and Brandt’s bats M. mystacinus/brandtii and Natterer’s bat M. nattereri have increased significantly, while the northern bat Eptesicus nilssonii, which is relatively rare in mines generally, has shown a slight but significant decline. At the species level the population trends conform well to those of the respective species in continental Europe and the British Isles. This suggests that there is a common factor behind the population changes across Europe. Although our data are very limited, the results question some previous explanations for the observed trends, but are in line with theoretical predictions based on global warming scenarios.",

            "abstractNote": "The Caatinga of northeastern Brazil is considered one of the most species-rich dry forests in the World. The area may harbor nearly 100 species of bats and correctly accessing such richness is a scientific challenge. Bat inventories have been usually based solely on mist netting, which is biased in drylands, where nearly half of the species are open-space insectivores flying high above nets, or species able to better detect and avoid nets. Here, we used mist netting and acoustic inventories in three protected areas in the Caatinga, so species richness could be compared based on both techniques. After an effort of 1,010 net.hours and 1,941 minutes of recordings, we recorded 29 species with nets, 27 on recordings, and five with both techniques. Acoustic sampling resulted in more species in 44% of nights sampled, and two nights had species recorded solely based on their echolocation calls. Species recording differed between techniques, and the driest the site, the lowest the captures with nets, while records based on echolocation remained constant. Based on species estimators, netting achieved 51% of the expected richness, acoustics achieved 87%, and both techniques achieved 70%. Using acoustic sampling we recorded ca. of 42% of the insectivorous species expected for the entire Caatinga and 20% solely on netting. Moreover, in our study bioacoustics indicated that some species were more abundant and widespread than expected. Therefore, studies using solely netting or bioacoustics will produce different results and, in Neotropical dry forests like Caatinga, for a more complete scenario on the local bat species richness a combination of both techniques is essential.",

It is distinguished from R. shortridgei and other similar species in the same group by its broad, parallel-sided sella, which is squared-off at the tip, relatively large body size with a forearm length of 42.2–44.1 mm, and bulbous rostral swellings. The echolocation frequency from hand-held individuals is 84.1–93.0 kHz. Bayesian analyses of a 654 bp of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (DNA barcode), and an 878 bp fragment of cytochrome b also support differences at the species level. Three specimens from Loaung Namtha, Lao PDR are referred to this new species based on DNA barcodes. Based on distinctive DNA barcodes and craniodental morphology, the taxon refulgens, is here regarded as a separate species from R. lepidus. Morphological comparisons between similar species are discussed and notes on ecology included.",

            "abstractNote": "More than half of the extant bat species rely on plants as roosts. Nevertheless, it is largely unknown how bats find these roosts and whether they use characteristic plant structures for their identification. The bat Kerivoula hardwickii regularly roosts in damaged pitchers of the carnivorous pitcher plant Nepenthes bicalcarata. These pitchers are characterized by two sharp, long thorns directly above the pitchers’ opening. In two behavioural experiments we tested, if 1) the length of the thorns or 2) the distance between thorns and pitcher opening has an attractive or deterrent effect on K. hardwickii. The bats preferred pitchers with longer thorns while the distance between thorns and pitcher opening did not influence them. This shows that the bats are not deterred by the thorns. It also suggests that they do not exploit the pitchers’ thorns as a protection against being preyed on while roosting. In this case the bats should have chosen pitchers with thorns close to the pitcher’s opening that provide the most effective protection. Instead, K. hardwickii seem to use the thorns as identification cues to find suitable roost sites. Generally, our study suggests that bats even attend to plant structures that do not provide them with a direct benefit.",

            "abstractNote": "Pteropids are large, highly mobile bats that are distributed widely across islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, southern Asia, and Australia. Dispersal behaviors and colonization patterns of pteropid species among oceanic islands are poorly known. In the southern Pacific, Pteropus samoensis and P. tonganus have partially overlapping ranges, existing in sympatry on the Samoan and Fijian archipelagos. These species exhibit differences in morphology and roosting behavior, with P. samoensis being smaller and tending to roost solitarily or in small groups. Here, we use genetic data to explore whether these species also exhibit differences with regard to patterns of population genetic structure within and between these archipelagos. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA are consistent with earlier morphological recognition of different subspecies of P. samoensis on the Samoan vs. Fijian archipelagos. Patterns of mtDNA haplotype sharing suggest that P. tonganus experiences restricted gene flow between, but not within archipelagos, while P. samoensis shows significant structuring both between and within archipelagos. Species-level differences in patterns of population structure among islands within archipelagos may be due to interspecific differences in morphology, roosting ecology, and/or feeding ecology that can be affected by human influences. Our results directly bear on the conservation of these species, suggesting that (1) populations of both species from the archipelagos of Samoa and Fiji should each be considered as separate conservation units, (2) P. samoensis are much less likely than P. tonganus to naturally supplement local populations through inter-island dispersal, and (3) P. tonganus may experience more severe population bottlenecks during and following cyclones resulting in lower mitochondrial genetic diversity than in P. samoensis.",

            "abstractNote": "Loss of tree cavities presents a threat to tree roosting echolocating bat populations. Bat boxes have been used for over a century to provide artificial cavities. The aims of this review were to provide a synthesis of bat box use in temperate parts of the world, to discuss the applications and effectiveness of bat boxes, to provide box deployment recommendations and to identify areas requiring further research. The 109 publications reviewed originated from four regions. The majority were from Europe (70%) followed by North America (16%), Australia (12%) and Asia (3%). Publications reported box use for research (n = 67), conservation management (n = 42) and public bat awareness (n = 1). The most commonly used bat box designs could be divided into five basic types, four originating from Europe and one from North America. Woodcement as a box material was frequently used in Europe and was practically absent elsewhere with timber boxes most commonly used overall. Seventy-one species of bats have been recorded using boxes, although only 18 were identified as using boxes commonly and 31 species were reported to have formed maternity roosts. The lack of maternity and overwintering roost records in boxes is a concern. There is a need to test current box types across geographical regions and to develop designs further. Where boxes are used as a conservation tool, consideration should be given to the long-term maintenance costs of a box program. Unless known to be unsuitable to target species, boxes should be made from durable materials, be unattractive to non-target species and be ‘self-cleaning’. Deploying a variety of box designs in clusters, time since box installation, non-target species box competition and target species-specific box design elements are likely influencing box uptake. The provision of boxes that comprise different microclimates and box aspects are likely best suited to meet the varying needs of a given tree roosting echolocating bat community. No conclusive evidence was found that box installation height is important for box uptake. There is concern that boxes may provide a competitive advantage for bat species commonly using boxes. Bat boxes should not be used as a justification for the removal of trees that comprise potential roost cavities.",

In this paper, we describe a new species of the genus Murina based on a specimen collected from Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve, Kon Tum Province in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. It is a medium-sized species with ‘suilla-type’ dentition. A taxonomic review of Murininae from Vietnam was also conducted based on combined morphological, DNA, and karyological characteristics. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit (COI) gene supported the subfamily Murininae, while the genus Murina proved to be paraphyletic in relation to the genera Harpiocephalus and Harpiola. Fourteen species of the genus Murina, one species of Harpiocephalus, and one species of Harpiola are recognized from Vietnam. Murina tiensa is regarded as a junior synonym of M. harrisoni; strong sexual dimorphism was observed in M. harrisoni. Relations between forearm length and total length of skull showed different trends among species and sexes. Karyotypes of Murina huttoni, M. cyclotis, M. lorelieae, M. beelzebub, M. feae, and Harpiola isodon were 2n = 44, FN = 50, while that of Harpiocephalus harpia was 2n = 44, FN = 52.",

            "abstractNote": "The yellow-winged bat, Lavia frons, and the heart-nosed bat, Cardioderma cor, are sympatric species of the family Megadermatidae resident to East Africa. Cardioderma cor roost in groups and disperse to individual foraging areas at night, whereas L. frons roost in male-female pairs in Acacia trees within a foraging territory. Nightly foraging areas overlap across species, and thus interspecific differences in echolocation may reflect niche differences crucial for coexistence. Here we compare differences in echolocation from hand-released C. cor and L. frons, and L. frons individuals recorded during fly-bys. Furthermore, megadermatids display a host of social behaviors, including territoriality and singing, and thus intraspecific differences in echolocation may be important for facilitating behavior in this family but has not yet been assessed. We report the patterns of variability of echolocation by sex, body size, and individual of C. cor. We measured 354 pulses from 17 C. cor individuals and 35 pulses from four L. frons individuals in Tanzania. Up to four harmonics were observed in both C. cor and L. frons, with the second and third harmonics emphasized and the first suppressed. Cardioderma cor is a surface gleaner while L. frons is an aerial-hawker, and clear differences in frequency metrics (Fmin, Fmax, Fpeak) and duration reflect this. We measured 17 variables including temporal, frequency, and shape metrics for intraspecific C. cor pulse analyses. A MANOVA testing individuality on five principle components was significant, but performed poorly in a discriminant analysis. Body mass and forearm length did not correlate with any pulse metrics. Males had significantly lower Fmin and frequency contour parameters than females, although males were slightly smaller than females. These results suggest that L. frons and C. cor have clear interspecific differences in pulse acoustics that align with guild differences, and may serve heterospecific discrimination, while some intraspecific difference in C. cor, particularly by sex, are suggestive of other factors beyond navigation that influence pulse variability.",

            "abstractNote": "The pteropodid fruit bat genus Eidolon is comprised of two extant species: E. dupreanum on Madagascar and E. helvum on the African mainland and offshore islands. Recent population genetic studies of E. helvum indicate widespread panmixia across the continent, although island populations off western Africa show genetic structure. Little is known about the genetic connectivity of E. dupreanum or the divergence time between these two sister species. We examine sequence data for one mitochondrial (cyt-b) and three nuclear regions (β-fib, RAG1, and RAG2) to assess population genetic structure within E. dupreanum and divergence between the two Eidolon spp. In addition, we characterize the demographic history of both taxa using coalescent-based methods. We find little evidence for population structure within E. dupreanum, and suggest that this reflects dispersal based on seasonal fruit availability and a preference for roosting sites in exposed rock outcrops. However, despite apparent panmixia in both Eidolon spp. and large dispersal distances reported in previous studies for E. helvum, these two taxa diverged in the mid-to-late Miocene. Both species are also characterized by population expansion and young, Pleistocene clade ages, although slower population growth in E. dupreanum is likely explained by its divergence via colonization from the mainland. Finally, we discuss the implications of population connectivity in E. dupreanum in the context of its potential role as a reservoir host for pathogens capable of infecting humans.",

            "abstractNote": "Karst landscapes are biologically diverse and unique ecosystems that are especially important to bats. As in other parts of Southeast Asia, cave roosting bats in the Philippines have suffered extensive human disturbance, and as a result, may be declining. Here we contributed to a region-wide effort to assess the status of cave bats by surveying bats in well-known caves and forest on limestone on Bohol Island in the central Philippines. We also assessed cave disturbance through physical signs and interviews. We observed and acoustically detected bats representing a total of 14 taxa in 23 of the 25 caves surveyed. Few species were present in most caves (median = 2 spp.) and only three caves had large numbers of bats (> 1,000). However, of the 29 bat species captured in forest, 19 are known to roost in caves, including the poorly known Philippine endemic, Hipposideros coronatus. Most surveyed caves experienced either current or historical human disturbance (88%), primarily by collectors of edible bird’s nests, bats for food, and guano for use as fertilizer in rice fields. High species richness, signs of population decline, and high human disturbance all point to Bohol Island as an important conservation area for cave-roosting bats in the Philippines.",

Two specimens from Central and West Kalimantan, Indonesia are referred to this species. A fourth specimen from western Thailand is referable to this species but on the basis of ~10% genetic divergence at the cytochrome oxidase-I gene is described as a separate subspecies. Morphologically and acoustically the two subspecies are similar. With a forearm length of 52.90–54.70 mm, a skull length of 24.27–26.57 mm and a call frequency of 49.2–50.0 kHz, the new species overlaps in size and call frequency with the sympatric R. trifoliatus. However, it differs significantly in having a dark noseleaf and a uniformly dark brown pelage, resembling, but being intermediate in size between R. sedulus and R. luctus, which have a skull length of 18.99–20.17 and 26.35–32.07 mm, respectively. It also differs from R. trifoliatus in the shape and size of the rostral inflation. It can be distinguished from R. beddomei (forearm length 55.00–63.44 mm) and R. formosae (forearm length 53.85–62.40 mm), which are endemic to the Indian Subcontinent and Taiwan, respectively, by its relatively smaller body size. Acoustic and genetic data are included in the comparison between the species. Both character states support the conclusions based on morphology. Further surveys in intact evergreen forest together with a re-examination of museum specimens may reveal that this species is widespread in Southeast Asia.",

Single individuals or pairs of common noctules Nyctalus noctula were recorded on five occasions only (26 and 27 August), all in calm weather and when little or no rotor movement occurred. Since such conditions were unusual (five of 50 nights of observation) the visits by the bats were unlikely to be chance events (migrating bats passing the turbine), but more likely involved bats attracted to the turbines. However, no feeding buzzes were recorded and the bats never stayed near the turbine more than one minute. The turbines studied are lit by 250 W white lights and this could have been the reason why bats visited the turbines, because such lights potentially attract insects. The bats could not have been attracted to the turbines by any factor related of the movement of the rotor or the generator, such as Doppler-effects, noise, heat or electric fields.",

            "abstractNote": "Concern for migratory tree-roosting bats in North America has grown because of possible population declines from wind energy development. This concern has driven interest in estimating population-level changes. Mark-recapture methodology is one possible analytical framework for assessing bat population changes, but sample size requirements to produce reliable estimates have not been estimated. To illustrate the sample sizes necessary for a mark-recapture-based monitoring program we conducted power analyses using a statistical model that allows reencounters of live and dead marked individuals. We ran 1,000 simulations for each of five broad sample size categories in a Burnham joint model, and then compared the proportion of simulations in which 95% confidence intervals overlapped between and among years for a 4-year study. Additionally, we conducted sensitivity analyses of sample size to various capture probabilities and recovery probabilities. More than 50,000 individuals per year would need to be captured and released to accurately determine 10% and 15% declines in annual survival. To detect more dramatic declines of 33% or 50% survival over four years, then sample sizes of 25,000 or 10,000 per year, respectively, would be sufficient. Sensitivity analyses reveal that increasing recovery of dead marked individuals may be more valuable than increasing capture probability of marked individuals. Because of the extraordinary effort that would be required, we advise caution should such a mark-recapture effort be initiated because of the difficulty in attaining reliable estimates. We make recommendations for what techniques show the most promise for mark-recapture studies of bats because some techniques violate the assumptions of mark-recapture methodology when used to mark bats.",

The fishing myotis (Myotis vivesi) is a species endemic to desert islands in the Gulf of California, where summers are extremely hot and winters are cold and windy. We explored thermoregulating abilities of M. vivesi measuring skin temperature (Tskin) on free-ranging individuals in winter 2010 and 2011, and in summer 2010. We also measured ambient (Ta) and roost (Troost) temperatures during the study, and we obtained data for wind speed at night time during winter periods. We found that all bats entered torpor in both winters and that at least three individuals hibernated for several days, which had not been reported previously for bats in subtropical deserts. In summer, three individuals entered short bouts of shallow torpor in early mornings. Roosts were slightly warmer than Ta in winter at nightime, and in summer they never reached temperatures > 38.7°C, even at Ta ≈ 45°C. Roost occupancy in winter was higher during windy nights in 2010 but no pattern was found in 2011. Therefore, in winter fishing myotis were more likely to remain in their night roosts and enter torpor when ambient conditions (e.g., strong winds) limit fishing on marine waters. In summer, roosts provide good insulation against high Ta, and bats might not need to resort to torpor to lower their metabolic rate except for a brief period during early mornings. When resources are limited the use of torpor may increase this insular species’ chances of survival.",

We describe them as a new species characterised by a relatively long forearm, moderately long ears, flat cranial profile and wide anteorbital bridge. Based on characters classically used to separate the ‘subgenera’ of Myotis the new species shows affinities to both the nominate subgenus ‘Myotis’ and ‘Selysius’. Our morphological investigations support recent phylogenetic analyses showing that the former ‘subgenera’ of Myotis are in fact paraphyletic groups, even within Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, many of the external and craniodental features formerly used to separate these subgenera provide a practical means of grouping species. Using these characters we provide an identification key to identify the new species, as well as other currently recognized medium and large sized, small-footed Myotis species from the Indomalayan Region.",

The data refer to three species; Nathusius’ pipistrelle Pipistrellus nathusii, soprano pipistrelle P. pygmaeus and common noctule Nyctalus noctula. Pipistrellus nathusii occurred at all sites (north to 61°N in Finland), while the other species were scarcer, particularly at the northernmost sites. The status of the recorded individuals is unknown. However, the activity most likely was of migrating individuals or individuals on migration stopover, because very few observations were made during the maternity period. Spring activity occurred predominantly in May, with the median observation date of P. nathusii 20 days earlier in the south (Germany) than in the north (Finland). Autumn migration was observed throughout August and September and activity that may or may not indicate migration was also observed in October and November. The median date of such activity in autumn usually occurred in September and without any significant difference in timing in relation to latitude. Migratory bats in the Baltic area apparently move on a broad front in most cases. The estimated speed of migration for P. nathusii in spring was 55 km/day. The entire coastline and islands around the Baltic Sea are of potential importance for migrating bats in spring (April–May) and autumn (August–September) and should achieve relevant protection according to EU legislation and its implementations.",

            "abstractNote": "In most mammals, reproductive cost differs between males and females in timing and duration because of the different sex-specific energy allocation strategies to maximize fitness. The differences in reproductive strategy adopted by sexes may result in differences in seasonal variation of body mass. Here seasonal variations in body mass are discussed for two species of vespertilionid bats: Daubenton’s bat (Myotis daubentonii) and Savi’s pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). Both species were observed to have a seasonal variability in body conditions, which was sex dependent. In late spring and for a given forearm length, females were heavier than males, but differences were small in late summer. Furthermore, female’s body mass decreased during late spring and summer likely to support the energy requirement for lactation, while male’s mass did not change (H. savii) or slightly increase (M. daubentonii) over the same period. On the contrary male M. daubentonii depleted body fat reserves during early autumn, likely because of the energy expenditure to increase mating opportunities. Our results suggest that seasonal changes in body condition in hibernating bats may reflect the differences in reproductive strategies between sexes.",

Subsequently however, it was recognised that this taxon was in fact a complex of species. As such, in 2012, two larger forms were recognised as separate and distinct species, namely: M. peninsularis in the Sunda region and M. fionae in Laos and Vietnam. In the current paper, a new cryptic species of the cyclotis-complex is described from peninsular Thailand based on a combination of external, craniodental and genetic differences. In addition, the population previously referred to M. cyclotis from the Nicobar Islands is described as a new subspecies of this new species. Despite this work and the research of others, the taxonomy of M. cyclotis still requires further study. The description of M. peninsularis is emended and the extensive variation in its morphological characters is addressed. The diagnostic characters of each taxon, as well as the additional data on ecology, zoogeography, distribution, echolocation and genetics, where available, are summarised and discussed.",

Although there are numerous studies on the taxonomy and phylogeny of the complex, group relationships are still debated. Previous studies hypothesised that this species originated in South America and later colonised the Antilles Islands either through a northward migration or an eastward migration via Middle America. However, these studies do not include populations from Middle America west of the Yucatan Peninsula, making it difficult to obtain a clear description of the role of these populations in the evolutionary history of the species. In this study, we describe the phylogeography and demographic history of A. jamaicensis populations from Middle America west of the Yucatan Peninsula using cytochrome-b (612 bp) and D-loop (391 bp) mtDNA markers. Our phylogenetic analyses (maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) did not recover clades corresponding to the previously recognised Middle American subspecies (A. j. triomylus and A. j. yucatanicus); rather, two haplogroups were observed, which showed extensive genetic diversity and strong genetic structure akin to that expected for a Middle American origin for the island populations. Bayesian skyline plots and mismatch distributions revealed that such haplogroups experienced a recent population expansion, which most likely took place in the late Pleistocene (100,000–216,000 BP). These estimates agree with earlier hypotheses that suggested a recent evolutionary history for A. jamaicensis, with hypotheses that suggested the existence of two different lineages migrating northwest from South America to Middle America, and with the possible colonisation of the Antilles Islands derived from both Yucatan Peninsula and northern South America.",

Nevertheless, little is known about the whether such information actually is being used by bats. Here we tested the ability of two horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus mehelyi and R. euryale; n = 20 each) to discriminate conspecific male from conspecific female echolocation calls and vice versa. Behavioural data from a habituation-discrimination paradigm revealed that both species were able to recognize the sex of conspecifics from their calls, providing evidence that cues on the sex of the emitter are encoded in echolocation signals. While our data support that the sex-specific acoustic cues are not (just) the horseshoe bats’ constant-frequency call part, their nature remains enigmatic. This is the second study to show that bats can recognize the caller’s gender from echolocation calls and the first to do so for ‘high-duty-cycle bats’; those that use calls with a prominent constant-frequency (CF) component.",

However, the extent to which vision is used is still poorly known. Here we test whether conspicuous visual cues increase the performance of the brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus in an experimental paradigm based on tree hole discovery by bats. We used experimental logs with bark ‘stripped off’ (conspicuous bright area around entrance) and with bark ‘not stripped off’ to investigate whether there were differences in effectiveness of finding the entrances with or without light. Results indicate that the bats’ effectiveness in finding the stripped entrances increased when light was provided. We suggest that the entrance was more visible due to high contrast between bark and wood. Our results indicate that visual cues could play a role in preselection of roost sites for this species.",

            "abstractNote": "We reviewed published and unpublished written reports on bat mortality at wind farms in northwestern Europe. The estimated number of bats killed per turbine annually was relatively low (0–3) on flat, open farmland away from the coast, higher (2–5) in more complex agricultural landscapes, and highest (5–20) at the coast and on forested hills and ridges. The species killed almost exclusively (98%) belonged to a group (Nyctalus, Pipistrellus, Vespertilio and Eptesicus spp.) adapted for open-air foraging. The bats were killed by the moving rotor blades as they hunted insects attracted to the turbines. This occurred independently of sex and age. Peak mortality varied considerably in frequency and timing among years, but the events usually (90%) occurred on nights with low wind speeds in late July to early October and to a lesser extent (10%) also in April-June. The mortality increased with turbine tower height and rotor diameter but was independent of the distance from the ground to the lowest rotor point. It was also independent of the size of the wind park (1–18 turbines). Bat species other than the open-air suite referred to above are usually not at risk at wind turbines, because they fly below the rotors, but are still killed occasionally (2%).",

            "abstractNote": "Vitamin D (represented by D2 or D3) is considered essential for normal calcium homeostasis. It is either synthesized in the skin following ultraviolet-B irradiation of provitamin D3 (7-dehydrocholesterol), or ingested in the diet as vitamin D2 or vitamin D3. Most neotropical bats are nocturnal, roost in dark places, and consume diets that lack vitamin D and thus have no other known source of this important nutrient. A few species, namely fish-eating (piscivores) and blood-eating (sanguivores), however, have the potential to ingest large quantities of dietary vitamin D. In this study, blood serum collected from five nocturnal, neotropical bats (including three plant-visiting species, one fish-eating species and one blood-eating species), was analyzed using a competitive protein binding assay (CPBA) to determine concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the major circulating vitamin D metabolite. Caveroosting (absence of sunlight), plant-visiting species (Artibeus jamaicensis, Brachyphylla cavernarum, and Monophyllus redmani) had a mean serum concentration of 25(OH)D between 7–15 ng/ml, values that are less than sufficient for humans. By contrast, caveroosting, sanguivorous Desmodus rotundus and piscivorous Noctilio leporinus, species which have access to dietary vitamin D, had a mean serum concentration of 25(OH)D between 236–247 ng/ml, with high values to 400 ng/ml, the highest recorded for any vertebrate taxon. These findings support the hypothesis that circulating 25(OH)D concentrations in bats are strongly influenced by dietary habits.",

The volume of data generated in surveys necessitates automated call detection, either in real time via a triggering function or offline, yet researchers are hesitant to replace traditional hand analysis without a thorough understanding of the accuracy and costs of automated detection. We compared detection accuracy and computational cost of the underlying algorithms used in commercial detectors (a zero-crossing detector, a spectral peak detector, and a high-band energy detector) with a model-based analysis method called the links detector. We predicted that the links detector would be more accurate than the other detectors, producing a larger effective detection range, because the links detector uses more information to make detection decisions. We also predicted that the links detector would be the most computationally expensive algorithm because of the processing needed for the extra information. We quantified the performance of the detectors using a synthetic recording environment, which provided an absolute ground truth for the experiments and allowed us to measure the effective detection range of each algorithm. The zero-crossing and high-band energy detectors, the fastest, were about 40 times faster than the links detector. Most of the computational cost was attributed to the filter used to remove low-frequency noise. The links detector, the most accurate, increased effective detection range by 6–12 m compared to the other detectors depending on species. The results will allow bat researchers to better understand the costs and benefits of automated detection methods.",

            "abstractNote": "Management of derelict mines to improve subterranean bat habitat and minimise safety risks to the unsuspecting public is occurring more frequently. Many caves and mines around the world have had gates placed at mine and cave entrances as a means of maintaining bat habitat and preventing human access, but there have been few replicated experiments to test their effectiveness. We experimentally tested a staged installation of a template gate at two mines while monitoring another two un-gated derelict mines in southeastern Australia. We recorded changes in numbers, behaviour and the relative species abundance of two bat species (Rhinolophus megaphyllus and Miniopterus schreibersii) before and after the gates were installed. The template gate (20 mm diameter plastic tubing) was installed in three stages, with the initial horizontal bar spacing at 450 mm, followed by a spacing of 300 mm and a final spacing of 125 mm. Bat numbers and behaviour were largely unaffected by bar spacings of 450 mm and 300 mm. The major findings were that immediately after the installation of bars at the final spacing (125 mm gap), numbers of bats declined significantly and a significant increase in the number of aborted exit and entry flights was observed. Detectors proved to be inadequate at quantifying changes in the relative abundance of species. Eleven days after the final installation there were no significant differences between the numbers of bats leaving gated and control mines, suggesting bats had learnt to negotiate the bars after a short period of time. However, flight behaviour was still affected after habituation, especially baulking at the structure when bats attempted to re-enter before dawn. The low replication of mines in the experiment warrants caution in extrapolating this result. Until further gating experiments are carried-out, we recommend site specific monitoring whenever mines are gated.",

Faecal pellets were collected individually and arthropod fragments identified to family level, where possible. Arthropod availability was assessed using Malaise traps. Selection analyses were performed using Compositional Analysis and a Chi-square goodness-of-fit test. The bulk of the diet of R. mehelyi consisted of Lepidoptera, representing more than the 80% of the consumed volume on average (excluding juveniles), and more than 90% of the average percentage occurrence. This pattern was consistent across localities. Neuroptera and Tipulidae were locally abundant. Other important prey categories were Chrysomelidae, Brachycera, and Chironomidae. ANOVA tests showed that there were no significant differences between males and females in consumed prey categories, whereas juveniles consumed significantly less Lepidoptera than adults. Lepidoptera was the first prey category in the preference rank, followed by Myrmeleontidae, Chrysopidae and Tipulidae, and all of these were consumed more than expected by chance. This work shows that R. mehelyi is a moth specialist and suggests that juveniles may acquire this strategy while gaining hunting experience. Given the similarities in echolocation call characteristics and diet in the sibling R. mehelyi and R. euryale, they may compete for trophic resources in sympatry. Nevertheless, subtle differences in wing morphology between both species are probably large enough to permit spatial resource partitioning.",

Documentation of the impact of such anthropogenic disturbance is essential for effective management. We re-sampled bats within Mount Isarog Natural Park (MINP), a protected area in southeastern Luzon, Philippines, seventeen years after a survey in old- and second-growth forest and in agro-pastoral areas was conducted in 1988. By employing harp traps and a tunnel trap, in addition to mist nets as used in the earlier study, we aimed to document species previously undetected by mist netting alone. We documented 26 bat species, seven of which were captured exclusively in harp traps, and two that were only captured in a tunnel trap. This survey resulted in nine new records of bat species for MINP, bringing the total number to 30. We did not recapture four species documented in 1988, all of which were noted in that study as uncommon. Nineteen species were captured in agro-pastoral areas on the south slope, including two Hipposideros spp. not captured at the forested sites.",

The inference based on molecular phylogenetics methods shows that these two morphotypes correspond to two mitochondrial groups within the Iberian Peninsula. Our results also support the model of ‘refugia within refugia’, where M. d. daubentonii has spread north and M. d. nathalinae has became an Iberian endemism. The haplotype network indicates haplotype sharing between Monfurado and S. Mamede (Portugal) and Bavaria (Germany), demonstrating current or recent dispersal and gene flow between these populations. Myotis d. nathalinae displays a substructure showing that populations under the same climate type are more related. As a distinct Iberian endemism, the conservation status of M. d. nathalinae should be reviewed.",

Mothers and young produced tonal (structured change in frequency over time) frequency-modulated (FM) signals with varying harmonic components in situations ranging from reunion to just before nursing. Pups left by their mothers were usually silent, only occasionally producing tonal isolation calls. Adult females used FM signals in stressful situations, times when young usually produced clicks. Vibrational signals (‘hums’) composed of clicks (broadband, no structured change in frequency over time) characterized pup-pup and mother-pup interactions but pups also used other clicks that differed in frequency components from clicks comprising the hums. In stressful situations, adults produced FM signals, the pups, clicks. FM signals of pups decreased in frequencies with increasing age (size). Echolocation calls of adults and subadults hunting flying prey differed in frequency components. Differences in duration of echolocation calls coincided with setting (short calls in flight cages, open calls in the open). FM signals produced by pups searching for their mothers’ nipples showed little potential for individual signatures. Calls and calling behaviour of eastern red bats that are solitary and foliage-roosting, differed from those of more gregarious species roosting in more sheltered situations.",

(1) Within the city limits, from the middle of July to the end of October but most intensively in September, the male bats occupied courtship territories averaging about 200 m in diameter. At night they patrolled these territories along regular flight routes emitting characteristic advertisement calls. By day they sheltered in crevices in buildings. (2) The courtship territories were densely distributed in the center of the inner city and rarer at the outskirts. As all known larger winter roosts as well as the ‘invasion centers’ (typical late summer swarming sites of this species) also were in the inner city, territories were situated around winter quarters, but not in the vicinity of the nursery roosts, which were lying at the edge of the city and outside it. (3) The males evidently arrange their courtship territories in such a way that as many females as possible pass through them when they inspect the winter roosts. That is, they are not defending resources important to the females; instead, they position their courtship territories near the resources the females require. As male territories are densely packed, the males offer a possibility for mate choice to the females, so that the mating system also bears some likeness to a lek.",

            "abstractNote": "Histochemical and immunohistochemical investigations were performed on the gastric mucosa of the greater horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (Schreber, 1774) to estimate the presence of a gradient of pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid along an oro-aboral axis of the stomach, similar to that found in some non-mammals. Paraffin sections were stained with DBA-lectin binding, Bowie and fluorescent anti-H+/K+ATPase α-subunit immunostaining to detect the chief and parietal cells in the gastric mucosa. The stomach of the bat presents a short cardias, a wide fundus and a small pylorus. Chief and parietal cells were found in the fundic glands and their number varied from the oral to the aboral region of fundus. In the oral region several chief cells with Bowie-positive pepsinogen granules were observed in the basal part of glands, whereas parietal cells positive to DBA-lectin binding and immuroreactive with anti-H+/K+-ATPase α-subunit were concentrated in the the upper part of the glands. In the aboral fundus chief cells were lacking, whereas the number of parietal cells increased and they were distributed along the glands. A gradient of pepsinogen and hydrochloric acid secretion similar to that found in some non-mammals can be hypothesised. The possibility that this gradient is the ancestral condition in Chiroptera and Eutheria and its functional meaning are discussed.",

A cartilaginous baculum anlage was evident at late embryonic stages. Initially, the distal part of the baculum develops during embryogenesis as a cartilage. Then the growth of the shaft and formation of the proximal portion occurs and it is shortly followed by ossification of the whole structure. The baculum continues to grows during the first months of the postnatal life and its length is correlated with that of the forearm. The baculum reaches its definitive shape and size by the age of 1.5 month in N. noctula and two months in V. murinus. Therefore, after this time period, the shape and size of the baculum cannot be used for age determination.",

            "abstractNote": "Fruit bats are important seed dispersers that aid in natural forest regeneration in degraded areas. This study assessed fruit bat species in a portion of Mt. Apo, Kidapawan City, North Cotabato from September to December 2010 covering six habitat types: human settlement area/residential area, agro-ecosystem/cultivated area, secondary forest/ reforested site, forest edge, riverine/riparian area and montane forest for 1,118 net night hours. The food habits of the bats were also determined based on fecal examination and dropped fruits, which were verified through secondary information using indigenous knowledge interviews. A total of five bat species were noted such as Cynopterus brachyotis (n=83), Haplonycteris fisheri (n=33), Ptenochirus minor (n=25), Macroglossus minimus (n=20) and Ptenochirus jagori (n=12) wherein almost 50% of these are Philippine endemics and could be considered as seed dispersers of diverse trees. This study recommends the protection of Philippine and Mindanao endemic fruit bats such as P. minor, H. fischeri and P. jagori, through the conservation of their staple food (Ficus species) and the remaining primary forest habitat.",
