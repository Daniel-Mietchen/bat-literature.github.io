            "abstractNote": "Bite force is a performance metric commonly used to link cranial morphology with dietary ecology, as the strength of forces produced by the feeding apparatus largely constrains the foods an individual can consume. At a macroevolutionary scale, there is evidence that evolutionary changes in the anatomical elements involved in producing bite force have contributed to dietary diversification in mammals. Much less is known about how these elements change over postnatal ontogeny. Mammalian diets drastically shift over ontogeny—from drinking mother's milk to feeding on adult foods—presumably with equally drastic changes in the morphology of the feeding apparatus and bite performance. Here, we investigate ontogenetic morphological changes in the insectivorous big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), which has an extreme, positive allometric increase in bite force during development. Using contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography scans of a developmental series from birth to adult morphology, we quantified skull shape and measured skeletal and muscular parameters directly related to bite force production. We found pronounced changes in the skull over ontogeny, including a large increase in the volume of the temporalis and masseter muscles, and an expansion of the skull dome and sagittal crest that would serve to increase the temporalis attachment area. These changes indicate that development of the jaw adductors play an important role in the development of biting performance of these bats. Notably, static bite force increases with positive allometry with respect to all anatomical measures examined, suggesting that modifications in biting dynamics and/or improved motor coordination also contribute to increases in biting performance.",

Thus, bat populations take a relatively long time to recover from increased mortality rates, and monitoring schemes should cover long time periods. In this work, we analyzed the population trajectories of two bat species, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Myotis myotis, the most numerous in five caves in southern Poland, which are known as important bat hibernacula on a continental scale. Data were collected by regular counts in 1985–2020, depending on the particular cave; in addition, previous data on the number of hibernating bats in these caves, available since 1951, were taken from existing publications. We analyzed time-series data using average locality indices and TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data) methods, and both produced similar results. Generally, the populations of the two studied bat species showed recent increasing trends, especially visible as an effect of recovery after years of decline. The situation recorded in southern Poland is very similar to that described in other places in Europe, where recoveries of bat populations have also been observed in the last decades. Although it is difficult to present results from formal analyses, because of the lack of good data, at least some factors—less exposure to contaminants (pesticides, heavy metals), improving food availability due to climate change, and a lower predation rate (including human pressure), both in the breeding season and during wintering—positively affected both species.",

Understanding how this diversity evolved and developing hypotheses as to why particular patterns exist require a phylogenetic perspective, which was first outlined in the work of anatomist Kunwar Bhatnagar. With the onset of genetics and genomics, it might be assumed that the puzzling patterns observed in the morphological data have been clarified. However, there is still a widespread mismatch of genetic and morphological correlations among bat chemosensory systems. Novel genomic evidence has set up new avenues to explore that demand more evidence from anatomical structures. Here, we outline the progress that has been made in both morphological and molecular studies on the olfactory and vomeronasal systems in bats since the work of Bhatnagar. Genomic data of olfactory and vomeronasal receptors demonstrate the strong need for further morphological sampling, with a particular focus on receiving brain regions, glands, and ducts.",

            "abstractNote": "Speculations about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 have catapulted bats into the spotlight of scientiﬁc and societal attention, with unforeseen consequences for bat conservation. In two global surveys with bat experts before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed their (i) threat perceptions, emotions towards bats and social trust in decision makers and (ii) the predictive potential of emotions, social trust and socio-demographic variables on threat perceptions. We also discuss (iii) the potential inﬂuence of the pandemic on threat perception and antecedents (emotions and social trust). We received 495 responses from 65 countries in September 2019 and 320 responses in June 2020 from 77 countries. We identiﬁed three major threat categories (indirect, direct and prejudice). Comparing threat perception, emotions and social trust between both surveys, we found that indirect threats (e.g., habitat modiﬁcation) were considered as crucial, yet less so during the pandemic. During the pandemic, experts rated indirect threats lower and the perceived threat through prejudice (e.g., myths) higher than before the pandemic. During the pandemic, bat experts also expressed more compassion and sadness related to bats and trust in researchers and NGOs, but less trust in laypeople than before the pandemic. Emotions were particularly important predictors for threats through prejudice besides social trust. Socio-demographic variables (e.g., cultural and professional background) had predictive potential predominantly for direct threats (e.g., hunting and trade, wind turbines) and threats through prejudice. Our study highlights the role of emotions and social trust on threat perception among bat experts who remained relatively invisible during the pandemic despite their key role for bat conservation. More importantly, we echo previous calls to be more attentive to ecological grief also within the scientiﬁc community; especially as discussions around zoonotic spillover with valued study animals intensify.",

            "abstractNote": "In the Americas, 8 million people are infected with Chagas disease, and an additional 90 million people are at risk for infection. Little is known about the role bats play in the sylvatic transmission cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing Chagas disease. Here, we captured bats in the villages of Palmiche, Pachacutec, Nuevo San Martin, and Mayuriaga located in the Datem del Marañon Province in Loreto, Peru. Venous blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture or from the upper extremities, and trypanosomatids were identiﬁed by microscopy and molecularly. We collected blood samples from 121 bats on ﬁlter paper for molecular studies and 111 slides for microscopic examination of thin and thick blood smears from 16 different bat species. The prevalence of trypanosomatids in all bats species was 34.7% (42/121) and the prevalence of T. cruzi was 4.1% (5/121). In hematophagous bat species, the prevalence of trypanosomatids and T. cruzi was 36.9% (27/73) and 2.7% (2/73), respectively. In non-hematophagous bats, the prevalences of trypanosomatids and T. cruzi were 31.2% (15/48) and 6.2% (3/48), respectively. Also, we conﬁrm the presence of T. cruzi in salivary glands of hematophagous bats Diaemus youngi. These results suggest a sylvatic cycle of trypanosomatid transmission in which bats may harbor infectious T. cruzi parasites that could be transmitted to humans via hematophagous bat bites or salivary contamination by non-hematophagous bats of vegetables consumed by humans.",

            "abstractNote": "The mustached bat (Pteronotus parnellii) is a mammalian model of cortical hemispheric asymmetry. In this species, complex social vocalizations are processed preferentially in the left Doppler-shifted constant frequency (DSCF) subregion of primary auditory cortex. Like hemispheric specializations for speech and music, this bat brain asymmetry differs between sexes (i.e., males>females) and is linked to spectrotemporal processing based on selectivities to frequency modulations (FMs) with rapid rates (>0.5 kHz/ms). Analyzing responses to the long-duration (>10 ms), slow-rate (<0.5 kHz/ms) FMs to which most DSCF neurons respond may reveal additional neural substrates underlying this asymmetry. Here, we bilaterally recorded responses from 176 DSCF neurons in male and female bats that were elicited by upward and downward FMs ﬁxed at 0.04 kHz/ms and presented at 0–90 dB SPL. In females, we found inter-hemispheric latency differences consistent with applying different temporal windows to precisely integrate spectrotemporal information. In males, we found a substrate for asymmetry less related to spectrotemporal processing than to acoustic energy (i.e., amplitude). These results suggest that in the DSCF area, (1) hemispheric differences in spectrotemporal processing manifest differently between sexes, and (2) cortical asymmetry for social communication is driven by spectrotemporal processing differences and neural selectivities for amplitude.",

The Hoary Bat presumably captured the Tricolored Bat and repeatedly bit its forearm and facial tissues while on the ground. The Tricolored Bat did not survive the encounter. Interspecific aggression has been observed in Hoary Bats previously and has occasionally been linked to rabies infection. Because of the circumstantial nature of our observation, we were unable to draw specific conclusions as to the nature of this behavior.",

In November 2016, we captured 2 non-reproductive Northern Long-eared Bats, 1 female and 1 male, in nets set in Beaufort County, coastal South Carolina. Previous records for the species indicate its nearest breeding colonies are >350 km away, and it had not been documented in South Carolina outside the Blue Ridge region. Although the Northern Long-eared Bat is known to move between summer roosts and winter hibernacula, it is not considered a long-distance migrant. Our records potentially represent an unrecognized coastal population rather than stray individuals. Such a population may be important for the survival of the species, which has been severely impacted elsewhere in its range by white-nose syndrome, a disease that is caused by the introduced fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which has not yet been recorded in coastal South Carolina.",

            "abstractNote": "Little is known about the ecology of many of the parasites and pathogens affecting bats, but host social behavior almost certainly plays an important role in bat-parasite dynamics. Understanding parasite dynamics for bats is important from a human public health perspective because of their role as natural reservoirs for recent high-proﬁle emerging zoonotic pathogens (e.g. Ebola, Hendra) and from a bat conservation perspective because of the recent emergence of white-nose syndrome (WNS) in North America highlighting the potential population impacts of parasites and pathogens. Although some bat species are among the most gregarious of mammals, species vary widely in terms of their social behavior and this variation could inﬂuence pathogen transmission and impacts. Here, we review the literature on links between bat social behavior and parasite dynamics. Using standardized search terms in Web of Science, we identiﬁed articles that explicitly tested or discussed links between some aspect of bat sociality and parasite transmission or host population impacts. We identiﬁed social network analysis, epidemiological modeling, and interspeciﬁc comparative analyses as the most commonly used methods to quantify relationships between social behavior and parasite-risk in bats while WNS, Hendra virus, and arthropod ectoparasites were the most commonly studied host-parasite systems. We summarize known host-parasite relationships in these three systems and propose testable hypotheses that could improve our understanding of links between host sociality and parasite-dynamics in bats.",

On this study, we aimed to identify the occurrence and characterize 16S and 23S rRNA genes of hemoplasma species in four bats species (Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Sturnira lilium and Sturnira tildae) from forest fragments in Paraná State, southern Brazil, using PCR-based assays. Spleen tissue samples were collected, DNA extracted and further screened by a pan‑hemoplasma PCR assay. All samples consistently amplified the mammal endogenous gapdh gene. One out of 15 (6.66%; 95% CI: 0.2-31%) bats tested positive for hemotropic Mycoplasma sp. by the PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene fragment from the hemoplasma-positive bat showed 99.14% identity with hemotropic Mycoplasma sp. detected in Sturnira parvidens from Belize. Sequencing of the 23S rRNA gene fragment from the hemoplasma-positive bat showed 86.17% identity with ‘Candidatus Mycoplasma haemosphiggurus’ detected in orange-spined hairy dwarf porcupines (Sphiggurus villosus) from Southern Brazil.",

We applied SNP genotyping and molecular sexing to 209\n              M. gigas\n              scats collected from seven caves in the Pilbara, Western Australia, employing a two-step genotyping protocol and identifying unique genotypes using a custom-made R package, ScatMatch. Following data cleaning, the average amplification rate was 0.90 ± 0.01 and SNP genotyping errors were low (allelic dropout 0.003 ± 0.000) allowing clustering of scats based on one or fewer allelic mismatches. We identified 19 unique bats (9 confirmed/likely males and 10 confirmed/likely females) from a maternity and multiple transitory roosts, with two male bats detected using roosts, 9 km and 47 m apart. The accuracy of our SNP panels enabled a high level of confidence in the identification of individual bats. Targeted SNP genotyping is a valuable tool for monitoring and tracking of non-model species through a minimally invasive sampling approach.",

A massive die-off of Schreibers’s bats (\n              Miniopterus schreibersii\n              ) in the Iberian Peninsula in 2002 led to its initial discovery. Recent studies with recombinant and wild-type LLOV isolates confirmed the zoonotic nature of the virus in vitro. We examined bat samples from Italy for the presence of LLOV in an area outside of the currently known distribution range of the virus. We detected one positive sample from 2020, sequenced the complete coding region of the viral genome and established an infectious isolate of the virus. In addition, we performed the first comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the virus, using the Spanish, Hungarian and the Italian sequences. The most important achievement of this study is the establishment of an additional infectious LLOV isolate from a bat sample using the SuBK12-08 cells, demonstrating that this cell line is highly susceptible to LLOV infection and confirming the previous observation that these bats are effective hosts of the virus in nature. This result further strengthens the role of bats as the natural hosts for zoonotic filoviruses.",

Advances in passive integrated transponder (PIT) technology have enabled passive detection or ‘resight’ of marked individuals using large antennas with greater read-ranges than previously possible. We used passively-detected resight data and CMR models to study survival rates of the southern bent-winged bat\n              Miniopterus orianae bassanii\n              , a critically endangered, cave-dwelling bat. Over three years, we used PIT-tagging to monitor 2966 individuals at the species’ largest breeding aggregation, using daily detection data (> 1.6 million detections) to estimate seasonal survival probabilities, structured by age, sex and reproductive status, and parameterise population projection matrices. This has hitherto been impossible using traditional CMR methods due to disturbance risk and low recapture rates. Bats exhibited lowest apparent seasonal survival over summer and autumn, particularly for reproductive females in summer (when lactating) and juveniles in autumn (after weaning), and high survival in winter. Lowest survival rates coincided with severe drought in summer–autumn 2016, suggesting that dry conditions affect population viability. Under all likely demographic assumptions, population projection matrices suggested the population is in deterministic decline, requiring urgent action to reduce extinction risk. Passively-collected resight data can now be used in combination with CMR models to provide extensive, robust information for targeted wildlife population management.",

Using coalescent theory, the shallow (short branches relative to the hosts) consensus species tree provides evidence of recent gene flow events between bat and pangolin beta coronaviruses predating the zoonotic transfer to humans. The consensus species tree was also used to reconstruct the ancestral sequence of human SARS-CoV-2, which was 2 nucleotides different from the Wuhan sequence. The time to most recent common ancestor was estimated to be Dec 8, 2019 with a bat origin. Some human, bat, and pangolin coronavirus lineages found in China are phylogenetically distinct, a rare example of a class II phylogeography pattern (Avise et al. in Ann Rev Eco Syst 18:489–422, 1987). The consensus species tree is a product of evolutionary factors, providing evidence of repeated zoonotic transfers between bat and pangolin as a reservoir for future zoonotic transfers to humans.",

All cases of injured bats were evaluated and categorized according to date, place, sex, age, and etiology of the morbidity. The data analysis revealed an increase in all types of morbidity during the wintertime, with more than two-fold the number of cases per week compared to in the summer, over three consecutive years. Moreover, we found that the number of abandoned pups peaked during spring and summer, when adult morbidity is minimal. We characterized two prominent types of previously undescribed morbidities in\n              R. aegyptiacus\n              . We also employed GPS tracking to monitor the movement and foraging of dozens of bats, and to examine the potential correlates of elevated winter morbidity. Our results suggest that it is mainly harsh weather that drives the observed winter morbidity, with food limitations playing a minor-role. We hypothesize that\n              R. aegyptiacus\n              , of tropical origin, is facing major seasonal survival difficulties near the northern edge of its distribution, probably limiting its spread further northwards still.",

Previous studies have suggested that geographic range size should be positively correlated with niche breadth, allowing widespread species to sustain viable populations over diverse environmental gradients. We examined the congruence of phenotypic and phylogenetic divergence with the environmental factors that help maintain species level diversity in the geographically widespread hoary bats (\n              Lasiurus cinereus\n              sensu lato) across their distribution. Genetic sequences were analyzed using multiple phylogenetic and species delimitation methods, and phenotypic data were analyzed using supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches. Spatial data from environmental, geographic, and topographic features were analyzed in a multiple regression analysis to determine their relative effect on phenotypic diversity. Ecological niches of each hoary bat species were examined in environmental space to quantify niche overlap, equivalency, and the magnitude of niche differentiation. Phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses support existence of three geographically structured species of hoary bat, each of which is phenotypically distinct. However, the Hawaiian hoary bat is morphologically more similar to the South American species than to the North American species despite a closer phylogenetic relationship to the latter. Multiple regression and niche analyses revealed higher environmental similarities between the South American and Hawaiian species. Hoary bats thus exhibit a pattern of phenotypic variation that disagrees with well-supported genetic divergences, instead indicating phenotypic convergence driven by similar environmental features and relatively conserved niches occupied in tropical latitudes.",

The family Phyllostomidae (Order Chiroptera) has frequently been the focus of research evaluating bats’ response to habitat disturbance in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs). However, few studies compare this family to the larger bat assemblage to assess its efficacy as a bioindicator. We compared community and species-specific attributes of understory phyllostomid and all understory bat species: (1) along a gradient of habitat disturbance within a human-modified SDTF landscape; and (2) between forest and riparian habitats within each disturbance level. We captured 290 individuals belonging to 13 species and 4 families. Phyllostomid species exhibited greater sensitivity to disturbance than the understory bat community as a whole based on richness and beta diversity. Both groups were more sensitive to disturbance in forest than riparian habitat, but phyllostomid species were more likely to be lost from highly disturbed forest habitat. The two dominant species declined in abundance with disturbance but variation in body condition was species-specific. These results suggest that Phyllostomidae are more effective indicators of human disturbance in SDTF than the understory bat community as a whole and evaluation of bats’ response to disturbance is best accomplished with a multifaceted approach.",

Currently,\n              in vivo\n              studies of bats are hampered due to their low reproduction rates. To overcome this, we transplanted bat cells from bone marrow (BM) and spleen into an immunodeficient mouse strain NOD-scid IL-2R\n              −/−\n              (NSG), and have successfully established stable, long-term reconstitution of bat immune cells in mice (bat-mice). Immune functionality of our bat-mouse model was demonstrated through generation of antigen-specific antibody response by bat cells following immunization. Post-engraftment of total bat BM cells and splenocytes, bat immune cells survived, expanded and repopulated the mouse without any observable clinical abnormalities. Utilizing bat’s remarkable immunological functions, this novel model has a potential to be transformed into a powerful platform for basic and translational research.",

Bats, primarily having female-biased SSD, have so far been tested for whether SSD allometry conforms to Rensch’s rule in only three studies. However, these studies did not consider phylogeny, and thus the mechanisms underlying SSD variations in bats remain unclear. Thus, the present study reviewed published and original data, including body size, baculum size, and habitat types in 45 bats of the family Rhinolophidae to determine whether horseshoe bats follow Rensch’s rule using a phylogenetic comparative framework. We also investigated the potential effect of postcopulatory sexual selection and habitat type on SSD. Our findings indicated that Rensch’s rule did not apply to Rhinolophidae, suggesting that SSD did not significantly vary with increasing size. This pattern may be attributable interactions between weak sexual selection to male body size and strong fecundity selection for on female body size. The degree of SSD among horseshoe bats may be attributed to a phylogenetic effect rather than to the intersexual competition for food or to baculum length. Interestingly, we observed that species in open habitats exhibited greater SSD than those in dense forests, suggesting that habitat types may be associated with variations in SSD in horseshoe bats.",

In winter from 2011 to 2018, we acoustically monitored, and counted in hibernacula, two species of conservation concern—western small-footed myotis (\n              Myotis ciliolabrum\n              ) and Townsend’s big-eared bats (\n              Corynorhinus townsendii\n              )—in 9 caves located in important habitat for these species in western North America. We investigated if cave-exiting activity differed by species, cave, number of hibernating bats, moon phase, and weather variables. Both species exited hibernacula during all winter months, but most activity occurred in March followed by November. Although we counted almost 15 times more Townsend’s big-eared bats during hibernacula surveys, we documented western small-footed myotis exiting caves 3 times more than Townsend’s big-eared bats. Cave-exiting activity increased with increasing number of hibernating bats, but more so for western small-footed myotis. Both species of bats were active during warm weather and low wind speeds. Western small-footed myotis were more active during colder temperatures, higher wind speeds, and greater change in barometric pressure than Townsend’s big-eared bats. Our results provide a long-term dataset of cave-exiting activity after arousal from torpor during hibernation for these species before the arrival of white-nose syndrome.",

We compiled 283 surveys from 49 hibernacula over 32 years to investigate population changes of Townsend’s big-eared bats (\n              Corynorhinus townsendii townsendii\n              ) and western small-footed myotis (\n              Myotis ciliolabrum\n              ) in Idaho, USA. This area comprises some of the best bat habitat in the western USA, but is threatened by land-use change. Bats in this area also face invasion by the pathogen causing white-nose syndrome. Little is known about long-term trends of abundance of these two species. In our study, estimated population changes for Townsend’s big-eared bats varied by management area, with relative abundance increasing by 186% and 326% in two management areas, but decreasing 55% in another. For western small-footed myotis, analysis of estimated population trend was complicated by an increase in detection of 141% over winter. After accounting for differences in detection, this species declined region-wide by 63% to winter of 1998–1999. The population fully recovered by 2013–2014, likely because 12 of 23 of its hibernacula were closed to public access from 1994 to 1998. Our data clarify long-term population patterns of two bat species of conservation concern, and provide important baseline understanding of western small-footed myotis prior to the arrival of white-nose syndrome in this area.",

We report on methods for inferring population trend for the population of the spectacled flying-fox (\n              Pteropus conspicillatus\n              ) in Australia. Monthly monitoring is conducted at all known roost sites across the species’ range in the Wet Tropics Region. The proportion of animals in camps varies seasonally and stochastic environmental events appear to be influential. We develop a state-space model that incorporates these processes and enables inference on total population trends and uses early warning analysis to identify the causes of population dynamics. The model suggests that population growth rate is stable in the absence of cyclones, however, cyclones appear to impact on both survival and reproduction. The population recovered after two cyclones but declined after a third. The modelling estimates a population decline over 15 years of\n              c\n              . 75% (mean\n              r\n               = − 0.12\n              yr\n              −1\n              and belief of negative trend is\n              c\n              . 83%) suggesting that conservation action is warranted. Our work shows that a state-space modelling approach is a significant improvement on inference from raw counts from surveys and demonstrates that this approach is a workable alternative to other methods.",

Few species of the genus\n              Nepenthes\n              developed mutualistic relationships with mammals for nitrogen supplementation. Whether dietary changes require certain enzymatic composition to utilize new sources of nutrients has rarely been tested. Here, we investigated the role of urease for\n              Nepenthes hemsleyana\n              that gains nitrogen from the bat\n              Kerivoula hardwickii\n              while it roosts inside the pitchers. We hypothesized that\n              N. hemsleyana\n              is able to use urea from the bats’ excrements. In fact, we demonstrate that\n              15\n              N-enriched urea provided to\n              Nepenthes\n              pitchers is metabolized and its nitrogen is distributed within the plant. As ureases are necessary to degrade urea, these hydrolytic enzymes should be involved. We proved the presence and enzymatic activity of a urease for\n              Nepenthes\n              plant tissues. The corresponding urease cDNA from\n              N. hemsleyana\n              was isolated and functionally expressed. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis for eukaryotic ureases, including\n              Nepenthes\n              and five other carnivorous plants’ taxa, identified them as canonical ureases and reflects the plant phylogeny. Hence, this study reveals ureases as an emblematic example for an efficient, low-cost but high adaptive plasticity in plants while developing a further specialized lifestyle from carnivory to coprophagy.",

Knowledge of movements and behaviors of individual bats have been unknowable because of limitations in size of tracking devices and methods to attach them for long periods. We used sutures to attach miniature global positioning system (GPS) tags and data loggers that recorded light levels, activity, and temperature to male hoary bats (\n              Lasiurus cinereus\n              ). Results from recovered GPS tags illustrated profound differences among movement patterns by individuals, including one that completed a >1000 km round-trip journey during October 2014. Data loggers allowed us to record sub-hourly patterns of activity and torpor use, in one case over a period of 224 days that spanned an entire winter. In this latter bat, we documented 5 torpor bouts that lasted ≥16 days and a flightless period that lasted 40 nights. These first uses of miniature tags on small bats allowed us to discover that male hoary bats can make multi-directional movements during the migratory season and sometimes hibernate for an entire winter.",

To investigate the utility of geographic information systems (GIS) in studying bat habitat interactions, habitat delineations and bioacoustic sampling were conducted along two transects in Chautauqua County, NY (USA) from mid-May until the end of August 2013. Surveys were vehicular, and driven between 29 and 32 kmph in order to match bats' ﬂying speed. They were conducted starting 30 min after sunset on nights where the temperature was greater than 13 °C. In total, twenty surveys were completed, and 1248 bat calls were identiﬁed to species. Mixed models regression analysis revealed signiﬁcant interactions among all of the species of bat analyzed in the model. The model was supported with a secondary analysis comparing bat call density with land cover. This study supports the hypothesis that bats forage in different habitats at the species level and indicates the importance of forested areas to bats. Additionally, the methodology for this study has the potential to gather large data sets in a short period of time, while collecting data on several species of bat at once and has been shown to be useful in identifying important habitat features for bats using bioacoustics and geospatial analysis. Since the data has been collected following state guidelines, the dataset and its analysis establish a baseline for future data collection campaigns and in performing a similar analysis for other regions within the state of New York or areas worldwide.",

In this study, mercury bioaccumulation in insectivorous bat species (Mammalia: Chiroptera) was investigated on a broad geographic scale in Canada. Fur was analyzed (n = 1178) for total mercury from 43 locations spanning 20° latitude and 77° longitude. Total mercury and methylmercury concentrations in fur were positively correlated with concentrations in internal tissues (brain, liver, kidney) for a small subset (n = 21) of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), validating the use of fur to indicate internal mercury exposure. Brain methylmercury concentrations were approximately 10% of total mercury concentrations in fur. Three bat species were mainly collected (little brown bats, big brown bats, and northern long-eared bats [M. septentrionalis]), with little brown bats having lower total mercury concentrations in their fur than the other two species at sites where both species were sampled. On average, juvenile bats had lower total mercury concentrations than adults but no differences were found between males and females of a species. Combining our dataset with previously published data for eastern Canada, median total mercury concentrations in fur of little brown bats ranged from 0.88–12.78 μg/g among 11 provinces and territories. Highest concentrations were found in eastern Canada where bats are most endangered from introduced disease. Model estimates of atmospheric mercury deposition indicated that eastern Canada was exposed to greater mercury deposition than central and western sites. Further, mean total mercury concentrations in fur of adult little brown bats were positively correlated with site-speciﬁc estimates of atmospheric mercury deposition. This study provides the largest geographic coverage of mercury measurements in bats to date and indicates that atmospheric mercury deposition is important in determining spatial patterns of mercury accumulation in a mammalian species.",

Understanding bat-habitat interactions is crucial in terms of developing effective conservation plans. In an effort to model bat habitat suitability in the Cassadaga Creek watershed, long-term bioacoustic bat data (spanning 2009–2020) was compiled, georeferenced and statistically analyzed using logistic regression techniques. In total, 1600 bat occurrence records from ﬁve species of bat (559 Eptesicus fuscus, 560 Lasionycteris noctivagans, 143 Lasiurus borealis, 260 Lasiurus cinereus, and 78 Myotis lucifugus) were paired with pseudo-absence points to study the relationship between bat calling behavior and land cover. All bats but Myotis lucifugus had a statistically signiﬁcant relationship with forested land cover, and all bats had negative interactions with agricultural habitats. Geospatial data was coupled with the statistical output to create maps of habitat suitability and echolocation calling density. This work provides a model that can be employed worldwide to evaluate bat habitat needs or patterns in echolocation behavior. Future research will incorporate a more recently collected dataset that is of greater geographic diversity with a larger number of environmental variables in the species distribution model.",

This study aimed to evaluate the health condition of bats from different food guilds captured in two areas with different land use proﬁles in Brazil and to compare data on the oxidant-antioxidant balance and histopathological changes due to different anthropogenic pressures. Bats were collected from a protected area in Serra do Cipó National Park (SCNP), MG, Brazil, and an area with intense agricultural activity in the municipality of Uberaba (UB), MG, Brazil. Despite the differences in land use and occupation between the studied areas, bats showed similar responses. However, the trophic guilds were affected differently. Frugivorous bats in both areas showed lower activities of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) and concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) than other guilds, which can be explained by the greater intake of antioxidants from the diet in addition to the lower production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Histopathological analysis of the livers revealed that the animals had a similar prevalence in the two areas, with some differences related to guilds. Compared with other bats, hematophagous bats from SCNP had a higher prevalence of steatosis and, together with frugivorous bats from Uberaba, had higher frequencies of ballooning degeneration, suggesting that these animals are subjected to anthropogenic factors capable of inducing disturbances in hepatic metabolism. Hematophagous bats from Uberaba had a higher prevalence of portal inﬂammation, while insectivorous bats from Uberaba had a higher prevalence of lobular and portal inﬂammation. The proﬁles of use and occupation of the areas are different; Uberaba bats seem to face worse conditions because they show more liver damage owing to lipoperoxidation.",

One of such stress factor is trace metals pollution which threatens populations of insectivorous bats due to their top position in the food webs and exceptionally long life span. In our research Pipistrellus kuhlii was tested as a promising indicator species (urbandwelling, sedentary, with limited daily home-range) for trace metal exposure of bats. We measured concentrations of Pb, Cu, Zn and Cd in internal and external tissues of bats from the industrial city Mariupol and the village Karlovka, Ukraine, to answer the following questions: (1) Do metal concentrations in soil samples differ between urban and rural areas, and between populations of P. kuhlii from those areas? (2) Does metal contamination differ between individuals of different sexes and ages? (3) Whether fur and/or wing membrane, the two tissues that can be collected from live bats, can be used as proxies of metal contamination in internal tissues (liver, kidney, lung, forearm bones) of P. kuhlii? Metal concentrations in soil samples were signiﬁcantly higher in the city. Bats from the city accumulated signiﬁcantly more Cd, Pb and Zn in external tissues than those from the rural area. Females accumulated more Cd than males, and this-year-born did not differ signiﬁcantly from adult individuals. We did not ﬁnd, however, signiﬁcant positive correlations between metal concentrations in external and internal tissues, indicating that external tissues cannot serve as an indicator of the metal contamination of internal tissues in P. kuhlii.",

Infection prevalence in the reservoir is a key predictor of spillover, but landscape-level associations between the intensity of land modification and infection rates in wildlife remain largely untested. Bat-borne coronaviruses have caused three major disease outbreaks in humans: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We statistically link high-resolution land modification data with bat coronavirus surveillance records and show that coronavirus prevalence significantly increases with the intensity of human impact across all climates and levels of background biodiversity. The most significant contributors to the overall human impact are agriculture, deforestation, and mining. Regions of high predicted bat coronavirus prevalence coincide with global disease hotspots, suggesting that infection prevalence in wildlife may be an important factor underlying links between human land modification and zoonotic disease emergence.\n          , \n            Bats in human-disturbed landscapes have higher coronavirus infection rates than bats in less disturbed habitats.",

Yet, they face intensifying threats, particularly on\n                    islands. The situation is epitomized by the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. In\n                    December 2016, the Mauritian government implemented the second mass cull of a\n                    threatened, endemic flying fox species,\n              Pteropus niger\n              (see the\n                    left photo), in 2 years. Government figures suggest that at least 45% of the\n                    overall\n              P. niger\n              population of just over 90,000 individuals\n                    were culled during the two campaigns; illegal killing and incidental mortality\n                    of pups during the culls raise likely losses to over 50%. The dire situation of\n                    island flying foxes worldwide calls for effective, science-based conservation\n                    strategies to prevent further loss of biodiversity and function.",

Despite the small size of the island and the lack of fresh water sources on it, we revealed the presence of at least nine bat species from four families, which were captured and studied in the hand. The family Pteropodidae is represented by Cynopterus sphinx, an extremely ecologically flexible species, and also by Rousettus leschenaulti and Eonycteris spelaea; family Hipposideridae — by three species of Hipposideros: H. grandis, H. galeritus and H. gentilis; family Rhinolophidae — by Rhinolophus cf. pusillus and R. pearsonii; family Megadermatidae — by Megaderma spasma. Mitochondrial DNA sequences were obtained for six individuals of three species, which made it possible to confirm morphology-based identifications of the captured animals. In particular, this concerned R. pearsonii, whose specimens differed from those known from the mainland, primarily by their smaller size. The presence of a multi-species bat community on Hon Tre Island necessitates careful planning of tourism and infrastructure development, in order to minimize impact on the natural habitats of the island.",

This makes their populations vulnerable when inclement environmental conditions such as cold and rainy weather impair the reproductive success of females. The fine-scale effect of weather on bats, however, remains largely unknown. Using a sliding window analysis approach on an 18-year individualized dataset on six Natterer's bat (\n              Myotis nattereri\n              ) colonies, we investigated the effect of fine-scale weather conditions on age-specific reproductive success. We found that increased precipitation during a short time window in spring strongly reduced the probability of successful reproduction of first-year (FY) females. Our data suggest that this time window is concomitant with implantation or early pregnancy, before substantial investment into embryo development. In addition, larger FY had higher reproductive success, suggesting that reproduction may be condition dependent in young females. Reproductive success of older females was not affected by either weather or individual parameters. Our results show that changes in precipitation pattern may compromise the reproductive success of FY females. Further studies are needed to better understand the impact of weather conditions on reproductive success in long-lived bats under climate change scenarios.",

            "abstractNote": "Regular nylon or polyester mist nets used for capturing bats have several drawbacks, particularly that they are inefficient at sampling insectivorous species. One possible alternative is to use monofilament nets, whose netting is made of single strands of yarn instead of several as regular nets, making them less detectable. To date, only one study has quantified the differences in capture rates between monofilament and regular mist nets for the study of bats, yet surprisingly, its findings suggest that the latter are more efficient than the former. Here, we provide further evidence of the differences in sampling efficiency between these two nets. We captured 90 individuals and 14 species in regular nets and 125 individuals and 20 species in monofilament nets. The use of monofilament nets increased overall capture rates, particularly for insectivorous species. Species accumulation curves indicate that samples based on regular nets are significantly underestimating species diversity, most notably as these nets fail at sampling rare species. We show that incorporating monofilament nets into bat studies offers an opportunity to expand records of different guilds and rare bat species and to improve our understanding of poorly known bat assemblages while using a popular, relatively cheap and portable sampling method.",

Two species of Cynomops. paranus and planirostris, are both present in Peru and supported by our vouchers.

A pesar de que los murciélagos juegan un papel muy importante en la estructura y función de esas selvas se desconoce como varía su diversidad en tales ecosistemas. En este estudio examinamos los patrones de riqueza y abundancia de los murciélagos en una selva baja y una selva mediana en la Reserva de la Biosfera Chamela - Cuixmala, Jalisco, México. En el periodo de febrero de 1992 a enero de 1994 muestreamos 18 meses, 36 noches y 180 horas, en un esfuerzo equivalente a 16,416 m² de red para cada ambiente. En total capturamos a 338 ejemplares de 15 especies. Nuestra predicción de encontrar diferencias importantes en la estructura y diversidad de la comunidad de murciélagos en ambos ambientes fue apoyada por la información recabada. El hábitat con mayor riqueza específica fue la selva baja con 13 especies; en la selva mediana registramos solo 10 especies. El índice de diversidad fue de H’= 1.99 y H’= 1.40 para la selva baja y la selva mediana, respectivamente. El mayor número de individuos capturados fue en la selva baja. Las especies que capturamos únicamente en la selva baja fueron Carollia subrufa, Leptonycteris curasoae, Musonycteris harrisoni, Pteronotus davyi y P. parnelli, mientras que, en la selva mediana fue Rhogeessa parvula. Las especies más abundantes en los la selva baja fueron Artibeus jamaicensis, A. intermedius, Glossophaga soricina y Dermanuraphaeotis mientras que en la selva mediana sólo A. jamicensis y A. intermedius fueron abundantes. Palabras clave: Diversidad, abundancia, murciélagos, temporalidad, selvas secas, selva baja, selva mediana, Jalisco, México.Abstract:Tropical dry and semi-dry forests of western Mexico show contrasting structural and phenologic characteristics that result in important differences in the species diversity of many groups of plants and animals. Despite the importance of bats in the structure and function of these forests, the variation in diversity in these ecosystems is not known. This study examines the patterns of richness and abundance of bats in a tropical dry and tropical semi-dry forest in the Biosphere Reserve of Chamela - Cuixmala, Jalisco, Mexico. Between Februray 1992 and January 1994 we sampled 18 months, 36 nights and 180 hours, in an equivalent effort of 16,416 m² of mist-nets for each environment. In total, we captured 338 individuals of 15 species. Our prediction of finding important differences in the structure and diversity of the bat community in both environments was supported by our findings. The habitat with highest specific richness was the dry forest, with 13 species; in the semi-dry forest we only recorded 10 species. The diversity index was respectively H’=1.99 and H’=1.40 for the dry and semi-dry forest. The greatest number of individuals was captured in the dry forest. The species captured solely in the dry forest were Carollia subrufa, Leptonycteris curasoae, Musonycteris harrisoni, Pteronotus davyi and P.parnelli while in the semi-dry forest was Rhogeessa parvula. The species more abundant in the dry forest were  Artibeus jamaicensis A. intermedius, Glossophaga soricina and Dermanura phaeotis, while in the semi- dry forest only A. jamaicensis and A. intermeius were abundant.",

It is known that several species of bats are hosts of pathogenic Leptospira spp.; therefore, they participate in the epidemiological cycle and can generate transmission scenarios to people and animals. The aim was to detect the DNA of Leptospira spp. in bats captured in four sites from the Yucatán Peninsula, México. A kidney fragment was collected from the bats and used to extract genomic DNA. Using a PCR, the DNA of Leptospira spp. was detected. Fifty–four bats of the species Desmodus rotundus, Mimon cozumelae, Pteronotus mesoamericanus, Pteronotus fulvus, Nyctinomops laticaudatus, Peropteryx macrotis, Molossus nigricans, Molossus aztecus, Noctilio leporinus, Saccopteryx bilineata and Mormoops megalophylla were studied. The PCR yielded a total frequency of Leptospira spp. of 44.4% (24/54, 95% CI 36.2–71.7%). Species with at least one positive individual were D. rotundus, M. cozumelae, P. mesoamericanus, N. laticaudatus, P. macrotis, M. nigricans, N. leporinus, M. aztecus, and S. bilineata. A high frequency of Leptospira spp. was found in different species of bats belonging to several trophic guilds. The presence of Leptospira spp. in bats is relevant for Public and Animal Health because the evidence indicates that they can generate zoonotic transmission cycles.",

Research on bats and wetlands has mainly focused on constructed wetlands, and with a geographical emphasis on eastern United States and central Europe, whereas relatively little is known about the effects of wetland restoration on bats, especially in the boreal zone. We conducted a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) study in 21 wetlands. Using acoustic survey techniques, we collected information on bats both before and after restoration, with 7 of the 21 wetlands acting as control sites and 14 as impact (i.e., restored) sites. Acoustic surveys were conducted in May–September in the years 2018, 2019 (before restoration) and in 2021 and 2022 (after restoration). Species detection for each night was assessed by automated analysis of audio recordings. We assessed the presence and number of active minutes of the Northern bat (Eptesicus nilssonii) and the Myotis species group, using a generalized linear mixed model. Wetland restoration increased the acoustic activity of both taxa, but not their presence. Thus, restoration increased the usage of wetlands as a feeding site for bats. Our BACI study provides strong evidence that wetland restoration caused an increase in bat activity, and can be used as an effective tool for bat conservation.",

Depending on the diet, bats are classified as frugivorous, insectivorous, omnivorous, hematophagous, nectarivorous and carnivo­ rous. The seroprevalence of T. gondii was higher in insectivores bats than fructivores bats. Owls, eagles, and cats can be predators of bats. Bats may be important in the epidemiology of T. gondii because they can be sentinels and can spread infection. Viable T. gondii has been isolated from brain, heart and pectoral muscle of bats. ToxoDB genotypes #9, #10, #6, #19, #69, #162 were identified from bats tissues. Genotypes #9 is prevalent in Asia. Genotypes #6 is widely distributed across Africa and Brazil. This result was matched with genotypes distribution from other hosts. The present review summarizes worldwide information on the seroprevalence, molecular epidemiology, isolation, genotypes and clinical cases of T. gondii infection in bats. Further studies are needed to verify the validity of serological and molecular tests, and the transmission routes of T. gondii infection in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Wind energy is a major and rapidly expanding renewable energy source. Horizontal-axis wind turbines, the main tool in this industry, induce mortality in ﬂying animals and consequently bring about conservation concerns and regulatory restrictions. We utilized a unique combination of RADAR, LIDAR and ultrasonic acoustic recorders to test the utility of a novel technology meant to prevent wind turbine-related mortality in bats. Our drone-mounted deterrent device produces a pulsating combination of strong auditory and visual signals while moving through the air. LIDAR was used to assess the device’s impact below its ﬂight altitude and RADAR to assess its inﬂuence above its ﬂight altitude. Continuous acoustic recordings from ground level to ~400 m aboveground-level were used to monitor bat activity in the research site. We recorded the nightly altitudinal distributions of multiple bat species throughout the experiment. Analysis revealed a signiﬁcant change in activity while the deterrent was ﬂying compared to baseline conditions. We also recorded a signiﬁcant ~40% decrease below and a signiﬁcant ~50% increase above the deterrent’s ﬂight altitude during its operation compared to the post-ﬂight control. The tested technology is independent of wind farm activities and does not require modifying wind turbine form or operation procedures. The device differs from previously proposed solutions by being dynamic – moving in the airspace and emitting constantly changing signals – thus decreasing the probability of animal habituation. Our ﬁndings suggest that the deterrent could dramatically decrease wind turbine-related mortality by deterring bats from approaching rotor-swept airspace. Focused implementation in conditions where bat activity and energy production are in conﬂict may provide a practical, cost-effective mortality mitigation solution compared to current alternatives. Thus, our results should be considered by the wind-turbine industry and environmental monitoring and animal conservation organizations, as well as by regulatory agencies, when pursuing alleviation of wind turbine-related mortality.",

Its fauna is distinctive in possessing a mixture of Moluccan near-endemics, such as Pteropus chrysoproctus, along with Melanesian species, like Dobsonia beauforti, that reach their westernmost limit on Kofiau. Very little has been published on the terrestrial vertebrate fauna on Kofiau compared to the adjacent islands. This paper presents two surveys of the terrestrial mammal fauna of Kofiau Island, undertaken in 2011 and 2019, increasing the number of species recorded from the island from 1 to 20: one rodent, two marsupials and 17 bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Comparative analyses of bats indicate that hibernation is associated with increased longevity among species. However, it is not yet known if hibernation affects biological ageing of individuals. Here, we use DNA methylation (DNAm) as an epigenetic biomarker of ageing to determine the effect of hibernation on the big brown bat,\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              . First, we compare epigenetic age, as predicted by a multi-species epigenetic clock, between hibernating and non-hibernating animals and find that hibernation is associated with epigenetic age. Second, we identify genomic sites that exhibit hibernation-associated change in DNAm, independent of age, by comparing samples taken from the same individual in hibernating and active seasons. This paired comparison identified over 3000 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) in the genome. Genome-wide association comparisons to tissue-specific functional elements reveals that DMPs with elevated DNAm during winter occur at sites enriched for quiescent chromatin states, whereas DMPs with reduced DNAm during winter occur at sites enriched for transcription enhancers. Furthermore, genes nearest DMPs are involved in regulation of metabolic processes and innate immunity. Finally, significant overlap exists between genes nearest hibernation DMPs and genes nearest previously identified longevity DMPs. Taken together, these results are consistent with hibernation influencing ageing and longevity in bats.",

One of the essential adaptations that have allowed bats to dominate the night skies is laryngeal echolocation, where bats emit ultrasonic pulses and listen to the returned echo to produce high-resolution ‘images’ of their surroundings. There are two possible scenarios for the evolutionary origin of laryngeal echolocation in bats: (1) a single origin in a common ancestor followed by the secondary loss in Pteropodidae, or (2) two convergent origins in Rhinolophoidea and Yangochiroptera. Although data from palaeontological, anatomical, developmental and genomic studies of auditory apparatuses exist, they remain inconclusive concerning the evolutionary origin of bat laryngeal echolocation. Here we compared musculoskeletal morphogenesis of the larynx in several chiropteran lineages and found distinct laryngeal modifications in two echolocating lineages, rhinolophoids and yangochiropterans. Our findings support the second scenario that rhinolophoids and yangochiropterans convergently evolved advanced laryngeal echolocation through anatomical modifications of the larynx for ultrasonic sound generation and refinement of the auditory apparatuses for more detailed sound perception.",

            "abstractNote": "Detection of evolutionary shifts in sensory systems is challenging. By adopting a molecular approach, our earlier study proposed a sensory trade-off hypothesis between a loss of colour vision and an origin of high-duty-cycle (HDC) echolocation in Old World bats. Here, we test the hypothesis in New World bats, which include HDC echolocators that are distantly related to Old World HDC echolocators, as well as vampire bats, which have an infrared sensory system apparently unique among bats. Through sequencing the short-wavelength opsin gene (\n              SWS1\n              ) in 16 species (29 individuals) of New World bats, we identified a novel\n              SWS1\n              polymorphism in an HDC echolocator: one allele is pseudogenized but the other is intact, while both alleles are either intact or pseudogenized in other individuals. Strikingly, both alleles were found to be pseudogenized in all three vampire bats. Since pseudogenization, transcriptional or translational changes could separately result in functional loss of a gene, a pseudogenized\n              SWS1\n              indicates a loss of dichromatic colour vision in bats. Thus, the same sensory trade-off appears to have repeatedly occurred in the two divergent lineages of HDC echolocators, and colour vision may have also been traded off against the infrared sense in vampire bats.",

Hibernation allows a diverse range of small mammals to exhibit seasonal dormancy, which might increase survival and consequently be associated with relatively slow life histories. We used phylogenetically informed GLS models to test for an effect of hibernation on seasonal and annual survival, and on key attributes of life histories among mammals. Monthly survival was in most cases higher during hibernation compared with the active season, probably because inactivity minimizes predation. Hibernators also have approximately 15 per cent higher annual survival than similar sized non-hibernating species. As predicted, we found an effect of hibernation on the relationships between life history attributes and body mass: small hibernating mammals generally have longer maximum life spans (50% greater for a 50 g species), reproduce at slower rates, mature at older ages and have longer generation times compared with similar-sized non-hibernators. In accordance with evolutionary theories, however, hibernating species do not have longer life spans than non-hibernators with similar survival rates, nor do they have lower reproductive rates than non-hibernators with similar maximum life spans. Thus, our combined results suggest that (i) hibernation is associated with high rates of overwinter and annual survival, and (ii) an increase in survival in hibernating species is linked with the coevolution of traits indicative of relatively slow life histories.",

            "abstractNote": "Differential coexistence among species underlies geographical patterns of biodiversity. Understanding such patterns has relied either on ecological or historical approaches applied separately. Recently, macroecology and community phylogenetics have tried to integrate both ecological and historical approaches. However, macroecology is mostly non-phylogenetic, whereas community phylogenetics is largely focused on local scales. Here, we propose a conceptual framework to link macroecology and community phylogenetics by exploring the evolutionary context of large-scale species coexistence, introducing the phylogenetic field concept. This is defined as the phylogenetic structure of species co-occurrence within a focal species' geographical range. We developed concepts and methods for analysing phylogenetic fields and applied them to study coexistence patterns of the bat family Phyllostomidae. Our analyses showed that phyllostomid bats coexist mostly with closely related species, revealing a north–south gradient from overdispersed to clustered phylogenetic fields. Patterns at different phylogenetic levels (i.e. all species versus close relatives only) presented the same gradient. Results support the tropical niche conservatism hypothesis, potentially mediated by higher speciation rates in the region of origin coupled with shared environmental preferences among species. The phylogenetic field approach enables species-based community phylogenetics, instead of those that are site-based, allowing the description of historical processes at more appropriate macroecological and biogeographic scales.",

Where vocalizations are transmitted by vertical cultural inheritance, similarity will reflect co-ancestry, and thus vocal divergence should reflect genetic structure. Horseshoe bats are characterized by echolocation calls dominated by a constant frequency component that is partly determined by maternal imprinting. Although previous studies showed that constant frequency calls are also influenced by some non-genetic factors, it is not known how frequency relates to genetic structure. To test this, we related constant frequency variation to genetic and non-genetic variables in the Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (\n              Rhinolophus monoceros\n              ). Recordings of bats from across Taiwan revealed that females called at higher frequencies than males; however, we found no effect of environmental or morphological factors on call frequency. By comparison, variation showed clear population structure, with frequencies lower in the centre and east, and higher in the north and south. Within these regions, frequency divergence was directional and correlated with geographical distance, suggesting that call frequencies are subject to cultural drift. However, microsatellite clustering analysis showed that broad differences in constant frequency among populations corresponded to discontinuities in allele frequencies resulting from vicariant events. Our results provide evidence that the processes shaping genetic subdivision have concomitant consequences for divergence in echolocation call frequency.",

            "abstractNote": "Significance\n            Many animal species are known for unparalleled abilities to encode sensory information that supports fast, reliable action in complex environments, but the mechanisms remain often unclear. Here, we present a nonlinear principle for sensory information encoding in bats. Through fast ear motions, bats can encode information on target direction into time-frequency Doppler signatures. These species were thought to be evolutionarily tuned to Doppler shifts generated by a prey’s wing beat. Self-generated Doppler shifts from the bat’s own flight motion were, for the most part, considered a nuisance that the bats compensate for. Our findings indicate that these Doppler-based biosonar systems may be more complicated than previously thought because the animals can actively inject Doppler shifts into their input signals.\n          , \n            \n              Many animals have evolved adept sensory systems that enable dexterous mobility in complex environments. Echolocating bats hunting in dense vegetation represent an extreme case of this, where all necessary information about the environment must pass through a parsimonious channel of pulsed, 1D echo signals. We have investigated whether certain bats (rhinolophids and hipposiderids) actively create Doppler shifts with their pinnae to encode additional sensory information. Our results show that the bats’ active pinna motions are a source of Doppler shifts that have all attributes required for a functional relevance: (\n              i\n              ) the Doppler shifts produced were several times larger than the reported perception threshold; (\n              ii\n              ) the motions of the fastest moving pinna portions were oriented to maximize the Doppler shifts for echoes returning from the emission direction, indicating a possible evolutionary optimization; (\n              iii\n              ) pinna motions coincided with echo reception; (\n              iv\n              ) Doppler-shifted signals from the fast-moving pinna portion entered the ear canal of a biomimetic pinna model; and (\n              v\n              ) the time-frequency Doppler shift signatures were found to encode target direction in an orderly fashion. These results indicate that instead of avoiding or suppressing all self-produced Doppler shifts, rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats actively create Doppler shifts with their own pinnae. These bats could hence make use of a previously unknown nonlinear mechanism for the encoding of sensory information, based on Doppler signatures. Such a mechanism could be a source for the discovery of sensing principles not only in sensory physiology but also in the engineering of sensory systems.",

We describe P. nitelinea sp. nov. from western Colombia and Ecuador and provide emended diagnoses along with descriptions of P. aquilus, P. dorsalis, and P. umbratus.

Using sequences encoding 78% of the rabies virus genome, we explored the extent, repeatability and dynamic outcome of evolution associated with multiple host shifts among New World bats. Episodic bursts of positive selection were detected in several viral proteins, including regions associated with host cell interaction and viral replication. Host shifts involved unique sets of substitutions, and few sites exhibited repeated evolution across adaptation to many bat species, suggesting diverse genetic determinants over host range. Combining these results with genetic reconstructions of the demographic histories of individual viral lineages revealed that although rabies viruses shared consistent three-stage processes of emergence in each new bat species, host shifts involving greater numbers of positively selected substitutions had longer delays between cross-species transmission and enzootic viral establishment. Our results point to multiple evolutionary routes to host establishment in a zoonotic RNA virus that may influence the speed of viral emergence.",

Our article emphasizes the importance of the bat's vocal-motor system to spatial orientation by sonar, and we present this view in the context of three problems that the echolocating bat must solve: (\n              i\n              ) auditory scene analysis, (\n              ii\n              ) sensorimotor transformations, and (\n              iii\n              ) spatial memory and navigation. We summarize our research findings from behavioral studies of echolocating bats engaged in natural tasks and from neurophysiological studies of the bat superior colliculus and hippocampus, brain structures implicated in sensorimotor integration, orientation, and spatial memory. Our perspective is that studies of neural activity in freely vocalizing bats engaged in natural behaviors will prove essential to advancing a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying perception and memory in mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "Molecular and morphological data have important roles in\n illuminating evolutionary history. DNA data often yield well resolved\n phylogenies for living taxa, but are generally unattainable for\n fossils. A distinct advantage of morphology is that some types of\n morphological data may be collected for extinct and extant taxa.\n Fossils provide a unique window on evolutionary history and may\n preserve combinations of primitive and derived characters that are not\n found in extant taxa. Given their unique character complexes, fossils\n are critical in documenting sequences of character transformation over\n geologic time and may elucidate otherwise ambiguous patterns of\n evolution that are not revealed by molecular data alone. Here, we\n employ a methodological approach that allows for the integration of\n molecular and paleontological data in deciphering one of the most\n innovative features in the evolutionary history of mammals—laryngeal\n echolocation in bats. Molecular data alone, including an expanded data\n set that includes new sequences for the A2AB gene, suggest that\n microbats are paraphyletic but do not resolve whether laryngeal\n echolocation evolved independently in different microbat lineages or\n evolved in the common ancestor of bats and was subsequently lost in\n megabats. When scaffolds from molecular phylogenies are incorporated\n into parsimony analyses of morphological characters, including\n morphological characters for the Eocene taxa\n              Icaronycteris\n              ,\n              Archaeonycteris\n              ,\n              Hassianycteris\n              , and\n              Palaeochiropteryx\n              ,\n the resulting trees suggest that laryngeal echolocation evolved in the\n common ancestor of fossil and extant bats and was subsequently lost in\n megabats. Molecular dating suggests that crown-group bats last shared a\n common ancestor 52 to 54 million years ago.",

However, their significance for public health remains unclear since their seroprevalence as well as antigenic relationship with human-infecting HVs have not been investigated. In the present study archived tissues of 1,419 bats of 22 species from 6 families collected in 5 south and southwest provinces in China were screened by pan-HV RT-PCR following viral metagenomic analysis. As a result nine HVs have been identified in two bat species in two provinces and phylogenetically classified into two species, Laibin virus (LAIV, ICTV approved species, 1 strain) and Xuan son virus (XSV, proposed species, 8 strains). Additionally, 709 serum samples of these bats were also analyzed by ELISA to investigate the seroprevalence and cross-reactivity between different HVs using expressed recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (rNPs) of LAIV, XSV and Seoul virus (SEOV). The cross-reactivity of some bat sera were further confirmed by western blot (WB) using three rNPs followed by fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVNT) against live SEOV. Results showed that the total HV seropositive rate of bat sera was 18.5% (131/709) with many cross reacting with two or all three rNPs and several able to neutralize SEOV. WB analysis using the three rNPs and their specific hyperimmune sera demonstrated cross-reactivity between XSV/SEOV and LAIV/XSV, but not LAIV/SEOV, indicating that XSV is antigenically closer to human-infecting HVs. In addition a study of the distribution of the viruses identified an area covering the region between Chinese Guangxi and North Vietnam, in which XSV and LAIV circulate within different bat colonies with a high seroprevalence. A circulation sphere of bat-borne HVs has therefore been proposed.",

            "abstractNote": "Wind energy is a growing source of renewable energy with a 3-fold increase in use globally over the last decade. However, wind turbines cause bat mortality, especially for migratory species. The southwest United States has high bat species diversity and is an important area for migratory species, although little is known about their seasonal distribution. To examine potential risk to bats in areas proposed for wind energy development, we characterized bat occupancy spatially and temporally across northern Arizona, identifying use during summer when bats are reproductively active and fall during the migratory season. Our objectives were to determine occupancy of migratory species and species of greatest conservation need and develop a probability of occupancy map for species to identify areas of potential conflict with wind energy development. We selected 92 sites in 10 clusters with potential for development and used acoustic detectors to sample bats in the summer and fall of 2016 and 2017 for 6 nights per site per year. We predicted response of migratory bat species and species of special concern to 9 landscape variables using Program MARK. During summer, higher densities of forest on the landscape resulted in a higher probability of occupancy of migratory species such as hoary bats (\n              Lasiurus cinereus\n              ), silver-haired bats (\n              Lasionycteris noctivagans\n              ), big free-tailed bats (\n              Nyctinomops macrotis\n              ), and species of conservation need such as spotted bats (\n              Euderma maculatum\n              ). During the fall, higher concentration of valleys on the landscape predicted occupancy of hoary bats, big free-tailed bats, and spotted bats. High bat occupancy in the fall was also associated with higher elevation and close proximity to forests. We recommend that wind turbines be placed in open, flat grasslands away from forested landscapes and concentrations of valleys or other topographic variation.",

            "abstractNote": "Monitoring is necessary for the management of any threatened species if its predicament and status are to improve. Monitoring establishes baseline data for tracking trends in distribution and abundance and is a key tool for informing threatened species management. Across much of the Old World, bats in the genus\n              Pteropus\n              (Pteropodidae, Chiroptera) face significant threats from habitat loss, conflict with humans, and hunting. Despite conflict with humans and their threatened status, few\n              Pteropus\n              are being monitored. Often, this is because of difficulties associated with their high mobility, large and easily disturbed aggregations, and their use of unknown or remote habitat. Here we describe 10 years of results from the National Flying-fox Monitoring Program (NFFMP) for the grey-headed flying-fox, (\n              Pteropus poliocephalus\n              ) in Australia. Range-wide quarterly surveys were conducted over a three-day period since November 2012 using standardized methods appropriate to conditions encountered at each roost. For our analysis of the population and its trend, we used a state-space model to account for the ecology of the grey-headed flying-fox and the errors associated with the surveying process. Despite the general perception that the species is in decline, our raw data and the modelled population trend suggest the grey-headed flying-fox population has remained stable during the NFFMP period, with the range also stable. These results indicate that the species’ extreme mobility and broad diet bestow it with a high level of resilience to various disturbance events. Long-term, range-wide studies such as this one, are crucial for understanding relatively long-lived and highly nomadic species such as the grey-headed flying-fox. The outcomes of this study highlight the need for such systematic population monitoring of all threatened\n              Pteropus\n              species.",

            "abstractNote": "Edge effects, abiotic and biotic changes associated with habitat boundaries, are key drivers of community change in fragmented landscapes. Their influence is heavily modulated by matrix composition. With over half of the world’s tropical forests predicted to become forest edge by the end of the century, it is paramount that conservationists gain a better understanding of how tropical biota is impacted by edge gradients. Bats comprise a large fraction of tropical mammalian fauna and are demonstrably sensitive to habitat modification. Yet, knowledge about how bat assemblages are affected by edge effects remains scarce. Capitalizing on a whole-ecosystem manipulation in the Central Amazon, the aims of this study were to i) assess the consequences of edge effects for twelve aerial insectivorous bat species across the interface of primary and secondary forest, and ii) investigate if the activity levels of these species differed between the understory and canopy and if they were modulated by distance from the edge. Acoustic surveys were conducted along four 2-km transects, each traversing equal parts of primary and ca. 30-year-old secondary forest. Five models were used to assess the changes in the relative activity of forest specialists (three species), flexible forest foragers (three species), and edge foragers (six species). Modelling results revealed limited evidence of edge effects, except for forest specialists in the understory. No significant differences in activity were found between the secondary or primary forest but almost all species exhibited pronounced vertical stratification. Previously defined bat guilds appear to hold here as our study highlights that forest bats are more edge-sensitive than edge foraging bats. The absence of pronounced edge effects and the comparable activity levels between primary and old secondary forests indicates that old secondary forest can help ameliorate the consequences of fragmentation on tropical aerial insectivorous bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Urban expansion is a major threat to natural ecosystems but also creates novel opportunities that adaptable species can exploit. The grey-headed flying-fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) is a threatened, highly mobile species of bat that is increasingly found in human-dominated landscapes, leading to many management and conservation challenges. Flying-fox urbanisation is thought to be a result of diminishing natural foraging habitat or increasing urban food resources, or both. However, little is known about landscape utilisation of flying-foxes in human-modified areas, and how this may differ in natural areas. Here we examine positional data from 98 satellite-tracked P. poliocephalus for up to 5 years in urban and nonurban environments, in relation to vegetation data and published indices of foraging habitat quality. Our findings indicate that human-modified foraging landscapes sustain a large proportion of the P. poliocephalus population year-round. When individuals roosted in nonurban and minor-urban areas, they relied primarily on wet and dry sclerophyll forest, forested wetlands, and rainforest for foraging, and preferentially visited foraging habitat designated as high-quality. However, our results highlight the importance of human-modified foraging habitats throughout the species’ range, and particularly for individuals that roosted in major-urban environments. The exact plant species that exist in human-modified habitats are largely undocumented; however, where this information was available, foraging by P. poliocephalus was associated with different dominant plant species depending on whether individuals roosted in ‘urban’ or ‘non-urban’ areas. Overall, our results demonstrate clear differences in urban- and non-urban landscape utilisation by foraging P. poliocephalus. However, further research is needed to understand the exact foraging resources used, particularly in human-modified habitats, and hence what attracts flying-foxes to urban areas. Such information could be used to modify the urban foraging landscape, to assist long-term habitat management programs aimed at minimising human-wildlife conflict and maximising resource availability within and outside of urban environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Wind turbines represent a source of hazard for bats, especially through collision with rotor blades. With increasing technical development, tall turbines (rotor-swept zone 50–150 m above ground level) are becoming widespread, yet we lack quantitative information about species active at these heights, which impedes proposing targeted mitigation recommendations for bat-friendly turbine operation. We investigated vertical activity profiles of a bat assemblage, and their relationships to wind speed, within a major valley of the European Alps where tall wind turbines are being deployed. To monitor bat activity we installed automatic recorders at sequentially increasing heights from ground level up to 65 m, with the goal to determine species-specific vertical activity profiles and to link them to wind speed. Bat call sequences were analysed with an automatic algorithm, paying particular attention to mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis and Myotis blythii) and the European free-tailed bat (Tadarida teniotis), three locally rare species. The most often recorded bats were the Common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) and Savi’s pipistrelle (Hypsugo savii). Mouse-eared bats were rarely recorded, and mostly just above ground, appearing out of risk of collision. T. teniotis had a more evenly distributed vertical activity profile, often being active at rotor level, but its activity at that height ceased above 5 ms-1 wind speed. Overall bat activity in the rotor-swept zone declined with increasing wind speed, dropping below 5% above 5.4 ms-1. Collision risk could be drastically reduced if nocturnal operation of tall wind turbines would be restricted to wind speeds above 5 ms-1. Such measure should be implemented year-round because T. teniotis remains active in winter. This operational restriction is likely to cause only small energy production losses at these tall wind turbines, although further analyses are needed to assess these losses precisely.",
