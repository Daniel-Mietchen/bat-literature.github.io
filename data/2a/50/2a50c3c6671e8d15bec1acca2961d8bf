            "abstractNote": "Wind energy has been the fastest-growing renewable energy source in the world. Studies have estimated bat fatalities at wind facilities, but direct comparisons of results is difficult and can be misleading due to numerous differences in protocols and methods used. We had a unique opportunity to compare fatality estimates from three wind facilities in southeastern Wisconsin. These three facilities are located within two neighboring counties with similar land use and land cover, used similar post-construction study methodologies, have turbine models that are close in size and nameplate capacity, and all became operational within seven months of each other. Our objectives were to analyze bat mortality data across all three wind facilities to: 1) examine species composition; and 2) investigate whether select structural, habitat, and landscape features influence mortality at a fine and broad scale. Corrected estimates of bat mortality were higher than reported in most other previous research in Midwestern agricultural lands in the United States. Similarities within the data were shared by all three wind facilities, but differences across them included species composition of bat mortalities and raw and corrected number of bat carcasses recovered. Our analysis suggested that select habitat and landscape features were among the predictor variables that explained bat mortality at the broad scale.

Unfortunately, detailed information regarding seasonal distribution and movements is often lacking, thereby hampering the development of adequate conservation measures. In this study we used radio telemetry to track females of the endangered Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii) from autumn swarming sites to their summer maternity colony ranges. We were able to tag 22 individuals, 18 of which were subsequently recovered at nine roost sites up to 20.6 km away. Females from multiple colonies visited the same swarming site on a single night. Concurrently, we recovered females from a single maternity colony at different swarming sites on the same night. The catchment area of the investigated swarming sites measured 27.1 km2, and was skewed to the northwest. Tagged bats were recovered in forest fragments ranging in size from 5.42 to 128.98 ha. Notably, all but one of the recovered roosts were found in forests that have been continuously wooded since at least 1775. Surveys during the summer at these sites confirmed the presence of maternity colonies at six out of seven locations that could be investigated. Our study contributes to our understanding of swarming behavior and seasonal movement patterns, and exemplifies how these can be used to complete the year-round habitat use of bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Among the many anthropogenic modifications to earth’s ecosystems, habitat loss and degradation pose the most immediate threat to many biota. The predicted consequences of fragmented habitats include lower species diversity, smaller population sizes, disrupted gene flow, increased drift and inbreeding and increased differentiation between neighbouring populations; all of which are thought to be further enhanced in species with low dispersal abilities. These factors, especially when occurring in tandem, can lead to an increased risk of extinction. To examine the genetic consequences of habitat fragmentation we selected an isolated population of a sedentary woodland specialist species (Rhinolophus hipposideros) to act as an indicator of disruptions to landscape level connectivity. Based on 491 individuals from 37 colonies our results revealed the presence of a broad North-Range/South-Range differentiation within this species in Ireland; a finding supported across datasets (mtDNA and nuclear microsatellites) and analyses. Analyses of echolocation data and microsatellites suggested further differentiation of the northern-most colonies. A landscape genetics framework to assess the impact of habitat versus geographic distance on population differentiation showed that habitat features (at a five km resolution) were equally likely to be correlated with differentiation as geographic distance considered alone. Further differentiation of the geographically disjunct groups is likely to occur in the future. The viability of either group alone is uncertain given their restricted distribution, small population sizes (based on census data and Ne estimates) and isolation. Roost provision and habitat restoration in the geographic region separating the differentiated groups will be fundamental to the recolonization of this area and the reestablishment of connectivity between the regional groups.",

Echolocation calls were recorded between November and February, and bat activity was regularly detected on warm evenings, with sun set temperatures above 4.6°C during the night sampling, mostly in November (89.9%), only rarely in December (3.7%) and February (6.4%) and without activity detected in January. The most commonly recorded species were Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. pipistrellus, and P. kuhlii. Socialization activity was mostly concentrated in November (96.8%), only with rare records in February (3.2%) and absent in December and January. Regarding the best fitting average model, obtained by the Multi-Model Inference (MMI) method to explaining the variation of bat passes, the main positive influencing factors are related with the night period of the monitoring process and temperature, and the negative influence with the precipitation recorded in the last 48 hours before surveys. The MMI results for the variation of social calls revealed as significant positive influences the humidity, temperature and wind speed and as negative influence the precipitation recorded in the last 48 hours before surveys. We outline our study as a promising baseline to the studies of winter bat activity, demonstrating how the present and past weather conditions can play a major role in bat torpor breaks. Therefore, for conservation purposes, further winter acoustic research efforts should be consider mandatory for full understanding the bat activity patterns facing the potential impacts of global climatic changes expected to occur in the Mediterranean region.",

This is aggravated by the increasing risks on their populations, particularly in primary lowland forests, the most threatened habitat in the country, which these species inhabit and also where chiropteran diversity is highest. In this study, the spatial heterogeneity of fruit bats within a primary lowland forest in Palanan, Isabela, northeastern Luzon was investigated. In addition, habitat partitioning patterns were compared with wing morphology variations. Mist nets were used to sample two vertical strata and three forest landscapes. Wing loading and aspect ratio were measured for all species captured. A total of 1,243 fruit bats representing eight species were caught from a sampling effort of 398,736 m2·h. All species were captured in the canopy, while only six species were captured in the understory. All species were also captured along ridges and forest edges, while only seven were captured along streams. Based on permutational MANOVA, a significant difference was found between the species assemblages in the understory and canopy, but not among ridges, streams, and forest edges. At the population level, Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed on capture rates per species. All eight species exhibited strong preference for the canopy, while only two species were observed to have significantly different capture rates across forest landscapes. Wing morphology patterns based on wing loading and aspect ratio did not show consistent association with vertical strata preference. The varying capture rates of bats along ridges, streams and forest edges may have been influenced by their feeding behavior. This study demonstrates the spatial heterogeneity of fruit bats across vertical strata and across forest landscapes, the most significant of which is the preference for the canopy. Possible factors that could explain these patterns include fruit availability, a cluttered habitat, and tree species distribution, which should be assessed in future studies.",

They constitute an interesting assemblage of temperate species that remains poorly studied. Here we uncover ecomorphological patterns of Patagonian bats using craniodental morphology, aerodynamic measurements, and external bodily characters. Multivariate analysis was applied to characterize morphometric variation of each dataset separately and in combination. We explored the segregation of species in morphospace, and the importance of phylogeny in the assemblage organization. We used a phylogenetic comparative method to evaluate historical effects on the morphofunctional structure. Our results indicated that the species of the Patagonian assemblage segregate in dimensions of morphospace by size and morphology, which would be related to prey selection (trophic differences) and habitat use (different styles of flight). We also demonstrated the impact of different cladogenetic events of the evolutionary history of species on the structuring of the Patagonian assemblage, with the successive addition of non-overlapping, well-defined morphofunctional types imported from other South American regions, and whit speciation events that resulted in species-level endemisms (Myotis chiloensis, Histiotus magellanicus, and Lasiurus varius).",

Across taxa, this resource defence behaviour (RDB) is predicted to maximize male reproductive success. Although RDB is widely observed in polygynous societies, its significance as an alternative male mating strategy among randomly mating individuals (i.e., promiscuous) is a less explored topic in ethology, especially within Chiroptera. In this study, we elucidate the relationship between RDB (measured here as male tent defence behaviour) and the harem size associated with adult males of Cynopterus sphinx. From 12 independent resident male removal experiments, we found that inter-male aggressive combats often exclusively occur while defending foliage tents in mating seasons. Further, our harem census data of usurper males (during usurpation) and resident males (post release), suggests a significant bias among females to preferentially roost with the resident males. This preferential association between harem females and the resident males that almost always recovers the foliage tent from the usurpers, suggests that C. sphinx harem males use RDB as an alternative mating strategy to monopolize roosting resources and maintain large harems. However, further research is required to identify the direct effects of RDB on individual male reproductive success.",

            "abstractNote": "In many temperate zone bat species, large numbers of individuals aggregate in autumn at potential hibernacula such as caves, mines, and cellars, for a behaviour known as swarming. This autumn swarming probably serves two functions, the achievement of matings and the assessment of potential hibernation sites. Even though this remarkable behaviour has attracted a lot of research during the last decades, several central questions regarding the autumn swarming of temperate zone bats remain unanswered. One of them is how juvenile bats (defined here as young of the year) are able to find swarming sites, which are typically dozens of kilometres away from the maternity colonies where they had been born. In this study, we used a combination of field data and population genetic tools to assess whether the juveniles are likely to learn the location of swarming sites from their mothers. To obtain non-destructive wing-tissue samples for DNA-based maternity assignments, 170 Myotis daubentonii and 195 Myotis nattereri were captured during the swarming seasons in two subsequent years, at a large hibernaculum in Germany. Based on 14, respectively 13, highly polymorphic microsatellite loci, maternity assignment tests were conducted for all captured adult females and juveniles that had been born in the two respective years. For M. daubentonii we found four assigned mother-offspring pairs, whereas in M. nattereri, eight mother-offspring pairs could be assigned with high certainty. Moreover, among the latter species, in seven pairs the mothers and the assigned offspring were caught within ten minutes of one another on the same night. Using a simulation, we show that for M. nattereri, significantly more juveniles than expected are caught together with their mothers at the hibernacula. We discuss the implications of our findings with regard to understanding autumn swarming behaviour in temperate zone bats, as well as for the conservation of bats that depend on swarming sites for mating and hibernation.",

Studying the activity patterns of bats can help to understand ecological and behavioural aspects of bat assemblies, especially in the Neotropics, where the group presents high species richness. The activity patterns of five species of Neotropical bats, sampled in a Reserve in the Brazilian Northeastern Region, were analysed. A general trend emerged, with an activity peak in the first half of the nocturnal observation. The overlap of activity patterns in closely related species (Artibeus planirostris and A. lituratus) agrees with previous findings that the nocturnal activity peaks in frugivorous bats have not evolved to relieve competition. The present work provides the first whole-night activity data for Dermanura cinerea. The results demonstrate the importance of whole-night sampling studies; not only as an opportunity to assess different ecological and behavioural data but also to efficiently register the abundance and richness of the assembly.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are an excellent taxonomic group for research on elevational gradients and functional diversity, as they present a large number of species and functional traits. In general, elevation has a negative influence on bat diversity, but the effect is not necessarily linear. Often the effect of elevation on diversity may have a hump-shaped pattern, in which diversity metrics peak in intermediate elevations before decreasing at the highest parts of the elevational gradient. In this study, we investigated the effect of elevation on bat species richness, abundance, and functional diversity in Rio Preto State Park (RPSP), a protected area located in the Espinhaço mountain range, a region globally recognized for its high rates of biodiversity. We found that RPSP harbours 22 bat species, which represent 69% of the species occurring in the Espinhaço range and include species of conservation concern. Bat species richness and abundance was linearly and inversely correlated to elevation, whereas functional diversity had a hump-shaped pattern, with higher values found in the intermediate portion of the elevational gradient. Our findings agree with other studies showing the overall negative effect of elevation on bat diversity and contribute to the still sparse knowledge about the effect of elevation on bats in Brazil and in the Espinhaço range. Furthermore, our results suggest that natural environments in lower and intermediate elevations (< 1,100 m a.s.l.) in this mountain range may have high biodiversity value for bats, and actions aiming at their protection would complement the conservation efforts focusing on endemic species associated with higher habitats in the Espinhaço.",

Growing evidence suggests that movement of individuals among populations may be more strongly determined by ecological traits. We compared genetic and morphometric differentiation in four species of bats — Eonycteris spelaea, Cynopterus sphinx, Rhinolophus affinis and Hipposideros pomona — which differ in their flight capability and roosting requirement to understand their effects in shaping genetic structure. Hypervariable region I of the mitochondrial control region was amplified from 40 E. spelaea, 28 C. sphinx, 44 R. affinis and 57 H. pomona sampled from locations spread across the Andaman archipelago. Populations of E. spelaea were nearly panmictic; R. affinis were differentiated into two clusters, and H. pomona were differentiated into three clusters. Consistent genetic and morphometric clusters were obtained for C. sphinx and the genetic break for C. sphinx occurs between Middle and South Andaman Islands, coincided with the Jarawa Tribal Reserve. In conclusion, poorly-dispersing, caveroosting species show high population structure, but when flight capability is very well-developed, the effect of disjunct roost availability is offset. The genetic structure of C. sphinx where we expected panmixia, is possibly confounded by the colonization history of its two genetic lineages and its habitat use which may prevent significant gene flow between the two lineages.",

            "abstractNote": "Even though agricultural lands provide abundant food to aerial insectivorous bats (AIB), our understanding of how spatio-temporal factors affect their foraging behavior in these habitats is limited and mostly restricted to temperate regions. In this study, we examined species richness, composition and patterns of activity of AIB in rice fields in the northwestern Llanos of Venezuela. Between 2013 and 2014, we conducted acoustic monitoring of AIB in two rice fields with contrasting forest cover, throughout three phases of the life cycle of this crop (vegetative, reproductive, and ripening), during the dry and rainy season. Out of 108 h recorded, we processed 12,630 files and identified 15 species and 10 sonotypes of AIB from families Molossidae, Mormoopidae, Vespertilionidae, Emballonuridae and Noctilionidae. Molossus molossus and Myotis nigricans showed the highest levels of feeding and general activity across species. The index of general activity (IGA) of AIB was higher above rice fields with more surrounding forest cover, during the dry season and throughout the entire life cycle of the plant. Relative feeding activity (RFA) did not change with respect to forest cover, season or crop phase, but a significant effect of the interaction of these factors was observed on this variable. The response of IGA and RFA to forest cover, season or crop phase was different between M. molossus and M. nigricans and among functional groups. Our results indicate that rice fields in the Venezuelan Llanos can be active feeding grounds for open space and edge-habitat foraging species of insect-feeding bats. Forest patches can promote AIB activity by favoring foraging of ‘edge’ species above rice fields. Higher general activity of most AIB species during the dry season suggests that rice fields are used more intensively when insect populations decrease in semi-deciduous forest patches around them. Overall, our results suggest that availability of abundant feeding areas to AIB, provided by the rice fields, together with presence of artificial and natural roosts to these bats, could ensure year-round permanence of a rich ensemble of AIB in the rice field-forest landscape in the northwestern Llanos of Venezuela. Some of these species could be the subject of field experiments to test their value in the control of rice’s insect pest populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Conventional monitoring tools are seldom effective for studying the ecology of rare and elusive mammals. In the present study, we use automated ultrasound detectors to provide information about seasonal activity of the greater noctule bat (Nyctalus lasiopterus), the largest and one of least known European bats. We selected localities within Central Europe with diverse geomorphological contexts, including rivers of different sizes and mountain passes. The study demonstrates the capability of the automatic recording approach to achieve bioacoustic discrimination of this species, but also pointed to the persistent need of integrating results from automatic classification software applications with the feedback from manual approaches. The high throughput capacity of the assay proved to be efficient, and the regular occurrence of the species was identified at two localities. These locations are associated with two known and intensely used migratory corridors of winged animals going through Vltava River valley and Červenohorské Saddle in Jeseníky mountains, as illustrated also by the activity patterns of other migratory species. Together with the occurrence of spring and autumn peaks in activity, these findings are in concordance with the plesiomorphic condition in pipistrelloid bats, showing also migratory behavior, and represent further indirect evidence of migration of the greater noctule. This pattern could be facilitated by the trophic niche of the species, involving predation of migrating songbirds. Differences in phenology of migratory species observed at particular sites likely mirror position of the locality in relation to migration flyways, seasonal and geographic variation in prey availability and energy demands etc. Further application of bioacoustic monitoring and other tools is necessary to obtain detailed information about the range and movement ecology of the species in higher latitudes.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats and their ectoparasites are excellent model organisms to assess the conservation status of protected areas because both groups are speciose, and bats can be particularly affected by land use changes. The majority of bat studies conducted in Panama are clustered in protected areas around the Isthmus of Panama, while protected areas outside the Isthmus have not been studied in depth or remain largely unexplored. Coiba National Park is located on the Pacific coast of the country and is the fourth largest national park in Panama. Despite its distinct isolation from the mainland and the periodic dry spells it has undergone during the last 25,000 years, Coiba National Park has highly preserved forests. We provide the first study that assesses the structure of the bat assemblage of Coiba National Park, describe echolocation calls of some of its aerial insectivorous species, and contribute the first species list of ectoparasitic bat flies (Diptera: Streblidae). Using mist nets and acoustic monitoring techniques, we identified 30 bat species from 904 captures and 751 recordings. Artibeus jamaicensis and Carollia perspicillata were the most abundant species captured, while Myotis nigricans, Saccopteryx leptura and Molossus bondae were the most frequently recorded aerial insectivores. Associated with the bats we also identified 22 species of streblid flies, all representing new records for Coiba National Park. The host specificity was 98.2%, a high value compared to studies in other areas of Latin America. In total, we found eight new bat species for Coiba National Park, increasing the species list to 39, making it, with a rather limited study effort, the National Park with the fourth highest bat species richness recorded in Panama. We reckon that such levels of richness are correlated with the highly preserved forests of Coiba National Park.",

            "abstractNote": "The Amazon region is made up of a mosaic of important habitats scattered throughout the rainforests, which differ in vegetation structure, basal area, primary productivity, biomass and production of flowers and fruits. Consequently, species richness and abundance also vary between these habitat types, in part explaining the high levels of richness found in the Amazon region. Here, we sampled bats using mist nets in three Amazonian habitats to explore variation in richness, abundance and community composition between habitats and seasons, and test for variation in the number and composition of bats captured in different mist net shelves. Overall abundance was highest in Amazonian savannahs, which is probably due to these habitats being more complex at the landscape scale — being composed of areas of savannah interspersed with forest fragments, gallery forests and palm stands. Abundance was also higher in the rainy season in savannahs and terra firme forest, and in the dry season in campinarana. In all habitats, bats were most frequently captured between 0.7 and 2.4 m from the ground. These results have important implications for our understanding of the ecology of, and habitat use by bats in the Amazon, particularly in the less well-studied habitat types of Amazonian savannah and campinarana. In addition, knowledge of the distribution of bat captures between mist net shelves serves to highlight that nets need not be set so close to the ground to maintain sampling efficiency, which is important as it may help to reduce opportunistic predation events of individuals caught in the lowest mist net shelf.",

Thus, there is a need to develop methods to estimate the age of bats, and teeth are excellent means to do so. The work detailed here involves an assessment of age-related changes and variation in tooth wear, dentine growth layers, and pulp cavity size in two bat species with differing life history strategies, i.e. Nyctalus noctula (n = 149) and Eptesicus serotinus (n = 49). Both the gross morphology and the histology of teeth in both species were found to display age-related variation. Morphological indicators like tooth wear and pulp-cavity size showed considerable variation at the individual level, and corresponding with broadly defined age categories. Dentine growth layering was consistent with presumed age and had annual growth layers in both species, along with accessory layers. Aspects of interpreting growth layers and tooth wear based on photographs and histological preparations associated with observer bias are important to consider, as are the sampling of multiple readings.",

Considering the qualitative assay, off 27 bacterial isolates, three strains were observed to be the hyper producers of xylanase. The potent isolates were identified using biochemical as well as molecular characterization tools, and were categorized under Bacillus spp. Further, the production of extracellular xylanase was quantified up to 72 h using standard methodology. The hyper production of xylanase was observed in the order of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain LAA64 (998.32 ± 17.6 U/mL) > B. methylotrophicus strain DLA64 (937.89 ± 16.1 U/mL) and > B. velezensis strain DLLA28 (910.46 ± 14.5 U/mL) at 48 h of incubation period. Evidently, these novel strains were identified as promising source for xylanase yield. Xylanase represents one of the most important groups of industrial enzymes and thus xylanases obtained from Bacillus spp. suggest their wide applications in diversified industries.",

            "abstractNote": "Folivory in bats has been described as chewing bits of leaves to extract the liquids, and then discarding the remaining fibers in form of oral pellets. At least eight species of Neotropical fruit-eating bats have been reported to use folivory as a strategy potentially to provide bats with vitamins, micronutrients and proteins usually scarce in fruits, as well as secondary metabolites that stimulate or inhibit reproductive processes, or even as a supply of water. All reported cases of folivory in bats consist of short, descriptive natural history notes with few supporting details. In depth understanding of leaf consumption by bats is lacking. To bridge this gap, we studied two colonies of Artibeus living under different conditions in the Venezuelan Andes: an urban colony (A. lituratus) and a forest colony (A. amplus) whose individuals exhibited folivorous habits. We hypothesized that bats: (1) feed on leaves from many plant species, and more frequently eat certain plant species over others, (2) show monthly variation in leaf consumption, (3) eat specific parts of each leaf and discard the rest, and (4) within a plant species, eat the same part of each leaf. We collected leaves found below the roosting site of the colonies of both species and analyzed digital images of each leaf to quantify the consumed area. All leaves (n = 1,188) were classified and quantified in terms of the pattern of observed consumption (apical, basal, other). We found that both species of bats fed on leaves from certain plant species over others, showed monthly variation in leaf consumption, and on average consumed less than 50% of the leaf, equivalent to an area of 5–7 cm2 (n = 655). Maximum consumption of leaves was observed in both species in the weeks immediately prior to males exhibiting scrotal testes and females becoming palpably pregnant. Results from our study provide the first systematic and detailed assessment of folivory in bats, showing the use of leaves all year long by two bat species. Future research should investigate whether males and females consume leaves to the same extent, and on the chemical properties of consumed plant species.",

Streblidae is a family of bloodsucking flies specialized in parasitizing bats, thus forming an ecological network. The purpose of this study was to investigate the specialization and modularity of a bat fly antagonist ecological network in a tropical dry forest in northern Colombia. Bat hosts were sampled by using mist nets, while bat flies were collected directly from the hosts by using entomological forceps. The network was built with the Bipartite package from R software. The sampling effort resulted in 270 bat flies recorded on 45 host individuals. The network showed a high specialization (H2’ = 0.67) and a low connectance (C = 0.30). Paradyschiria parvuloides was the most specialized fly (d = 0.95). The interactions exhibited a high modularity (Q = 0.57), with five modules. This study confirms the high specialization between bats and Streblidae flies, which is influenced by factors such as fidelity to the refuge and habitat, and host abundance.",

Acoustic detection is a way of circumventing the difficulties of catching bats, and monitoring is usually done either with transects or fixed recording points, the latter generally being assumed to be superior. However, little has been done until now to assess each method’s ability to maximize the quality of recordings and the number of species detected, to account for the temporal variability of bat activity, and to account for the variability in habitats and the spatial patterns of bat activity. We tested whether transects could yield similar results as fixed points for every of those aspects of accurate and reliable bat monitoring. We found it to be true for recording quality and the detection of peaks of activity, but found that either method was little affected by weather and landscape attributes. We conclude that the use of transects is a valid choice for long-term monitoring, as it performs comparably to fixed recording points and maximizes the number of detections per sampling unit. However, transects tend to record a greater proportion of migratory bats than fixed recording points, a bias which should be considered in the assessment of the state of particular species’ populations.",

            "abstractNote": "As technology has evolved, bat researchers have relied more heavily on using acoustic techniques to collect data on bat communities. Acoustic data can be collected actively, where the researcher is present at the sampling point and follows the bat with the detector, or passively, where the researcher is not present and the detector is set out by itself. Active sampling can yield longer, clearer calls, and is only conducted during part of the night (usually from sunset to about 02:00 hours) for short bouts (20 minutes). By contrast, passive sampling can yield lower quality calls, but procedures are easily repeatable and data can be used to measure temporal variation in activity throughout the night and detect individuals and species that are missed during active sampling. Researchers are increasingly attempting to monitor and compare bat communities over time, including sites where both active and passive sampling have occurred. However, these two techniques can yield different detection probabilities and the extent to which data collected using these two techniques can be compared is unclear. Thus, in July 2017 we simultaneously collected acoustic data actively and passively to compare detection probabilities of bats at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, USA. Using Anabat Express detectors, we detected five species or species groups (Eptesicus fuscus/Lasiurus cinereus, L. borealis/L. seminolus, Perimyotis subflavus, Myotis austroriparius, and Nycticeius humeralis) using each method. Using single season occupancy modeling, we found that method (passive vs. active sampling) had a significant effect on detection probabilities of all species, and that passively sampling throughout the night yielded the highest detection probability for all species. As a result, if differences in detection probability are not taken into account, comparison of historical active datasets with current passive datasets could lead to different insights into habitat use by similar bat communities. Based on our findings, we recommend that researchers use passive sampling throughout the night when studying and monitoring bat communities.",

Sturnira parvidens inhabits tropical lowland forests and S. hondurensis montane cloud forests. Their populations are respectively separated by the intervening highlands or lowlands. We used mitochondrial DNA control region sequences to compare genetic structure among the populations of these two species in the region of the Gulf of Mexico. We also measured genetic connectivity among their populations and assessed the distribution model for each species. We found high genetic diversity in both species: the FST comparisons values were low to high in S. hondurensis and low in S. parvidens. For S. hondurensis, we found isolation by landscape resistance (IBR) where the highland habitat heterogeneity may have restricted gene flow among the populations of the Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra de Los Tuxtlas, Chiapas and Guatemala. For S. parvidens, the isolation is explained by geographic distance rather than by landscape heterogeneity.",

Identifying important bat foraging habitats and the ecological requirements and conservation status of prey provides evidence for appropriately targeted conservation management strategies. We examined the foraging habits of the barbastelle, Barbastella barbastellus, at the northern edge of its European range using a combination of radio tracking, to determine home range use and habitat selection, and DNA metabarcoding, to identify prey items consumed. Riparian vegetation and broadleaved woodland were the habitat types most strongly selected by foraging bats. Hedgerows within pastoral habitats were also important foraging features within the landscape. We identified 120 different prey items within faecal pellets, the majority of which were moths (97.5%). The large majority (97%) of prey items consumed have larval stages dependent on host plants that are typically found within habitats selected by foraging B. barbastellus. Almost half of all moth prey species identified have undergone considerable population declines in recent decades. We present the most comprehensive list to date of prey consumed by B. barbastellus and provide evidence that conservation management policies should target the protection and enhancement of key B. barbastellus foraging habitats within a 6.5 km sustenance zone around maternity roost sites. Riparian habitat, broadleaved woodland and linear landscape features such as hedgerows should be managed to improve their value to foraging B. barbastellus as well as the developmental stages of their preferred moth prey.",

            "abstractNote": "Phyllostomid bats display a variety of social structures and mating systems; the influence of these features on the distribution of genetic diversity within and between bat populations is currently unknown. Based on the mitochondrial DNA D-loop region, we investigated the relationship between genetic structure and social characteristics in four species of phyllostomid bats (Sturnira hondurensis, Artibeus jamaicensis, Carollia sowelli, and Dermanura tolteca) inhabiting Selva El Ocote Biosphere Reserve (REBISO). According to their ecological characteristics, we expected a relatively high genetic diversity and stable populations, as well as a weak genetic structure in S. hondurensis and C. sowelli, and a moderate one in A. jamaicensis and D. tolteca. The demographic history and mismatch distribution were inferred. Besides, we estimated the time elapsed from demographic change (in number of generations). Finally, we calculated standard genetic diversity indicators and determined the genetic structure, haplotype networks, and conducted spatial autocorrelation analyses. Genetic diversity was higher in S. hondurensis, intermediate in C. sowelli, and low in A. jamaicensis and D. tolteca. The neutrality tests indicated population expansion in A. jamaicensis, C. sowelli, and D. tolteca; S. hondurensis showed differentiation between populations with no apparent demographic changes. The extent of genetic differentiation was high in S. hondurensis, intermediate in C. sowelli, weak in A. jamaicensis, and nil in D. tolteca. The spatial autocorrelation revealed genetic structure at certain geographic distances in A. jamaicensis, C. sowelli, and S. hondurensis, while D. tolteca displayed a low structure at the greatest geographic distances. No clear relationship was evident between ecological attributes and genetic structure in the bat species studied, probably due to the slight differences in the ecological characteristics of these species. Further studies should include ecological factors such as resource availability and habitat selection, as well as nuclear markers, to obtain a biparental genetic estimation. This study highlights the need of conduct further research about the relationship of ecological and genetic traits of tropical bats in high-biodiversity reserves.",

In the present study, we evaluated the incidence of antimicrobial resistance, molecular mechanisms of resistance and virulence genes among 42 strains of Escherichia coli isolated from faecal samples from wild colonies of European free-tailed bats (Tadarida teniotis) in Portugal. High antimicrobial resistance rates for ampicillin (57.14%) and streptomycin (52.38%) were observed. Genes encoding resistance to antimicrobial agents were detected in most of the resistant isolates. The E. coli isolates were ascribed to phylogroups A (44.24%), B1 (16.67%), B2 (2.38%) and D (35.71%). The virulence gene fimA (alone or in association) was detected in 21 samples. This study shows the presence of antimicrobial resistance in commensal bacteria from wild European free-tailed bats populations. Future studies are necessary in order to investigate the main source of contamination (through the environment or the food chain) and identify how they can be contributing to the spread of those bacteria throughout the environment.",

            "abstractNote": "The annual life cycle of temperate bats is typically accompanied by seasonal movements. In autumn, individuals of several species display very active flying behaviour around preferred locations, often hibernacula, a behaviour called swarming. This behaviour is usually characterized by a strong male-biased sex ratio and is often considered to be related to mating. Alternatively, these groupings may be a social behaviour related to the location and quality assessment of hibernacula and may enable this information to be transferred to juveniles, the maternal guidance hypothesis. Our study reports the results of a weekly survey of a bat community in an abandoned mine in Switzerland from April to October 2009, a period longer than the swarming period. The site is characterized by numerous visiting species as well as a high number of common pipistrelle bats displaying autumnal swarming like behaviour at the entrance of the mines. Thirteen species were present at the site with a total of 1,589 individuals of which 1,404 (88%) were common pipistrelle bats allowing us to focus on intersexual and age variations in their arrival phenology. Although the recapture rate was too low to obtain a reliable population size estimator, our data suggest that the site attracts individuals from a large area, possibly from several different nursing colonies and therefore requires a national conservation status. Adult males were present at the site throughout the study period with a peak from mid-July to the end of August. Females arrived later and both sexes displayed a swarming like behaviour in July and August. During this period, the sex ratio was slightly female biased, an unexpected pattern when compared with other swarming species. The absence of a male-biased sex ratio suggests that swarming behaviour in pipistrelle bats may have functions other than mating. Juveniles of both sexes joined the site about two weeks later suggesting that the maternal guidance hypothesis also did not explain this phenology pattern. The number of days between recaptures was greater for males than females indicating that males stay longer or return more often to the sites than females. Further studies may bring insights to the understanding of the function of swarming in pipistrelle bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are the second most diverse and widely distributed group of mammals, and may be directly or indirectly involved in some zoonotic diseases. Their baseline hematological knowledge and health condition in natural populations are important parameters, but when bats and humans cohabitate common spaces such as houses, buildings, and recreational parks, these variables become essential. Blood samples of bats representing 16 species from families Phyllostomidae (nine species; n = 104 individuals), Noctilionidae (two species; n = 24), and Molossidae (five species; n = 9) were obtained from 137 individuals captured in humanrelated spaces mostly in Mérida state, Venezuela. Hematocrit (Hct), total white blood cell counts (WBC), and differential white blood cell counts (DWBC) were quantified, and profiles compared in groups with large samples sizes and unambiguous reproductive conditions. Also, a general examination of blood smears was performed to assess the viability of in situ hemopathogen identification. Hct (0 ± SEM) of bats was 51.0 ± 1.9% for Artibeus lituratus (n = 53) and 51.0 ± 3.8% for A. jamaicensis (n = 18), the two most common bat species captured. WBC were higher in Phyllostomidae than in the other two families, and most species exhibited a DWBC formula dominated by lymphocytes. Lactating and pregnant females of A. lituratus showed higher values of neutrophiles than males and non-reproductive females. Overall, blood cell morphology and hematological profiles were consistent with those of other species of bats and/or mammals. Hemopathogens were observed in 19 individuals from three species. In this study, we report Anaplasma-compliant observations in blood samples of bats, but this first report requires molecular validation and further research to expand the knowledge on hemopathogens of bats. Our research is an important contribution to the hematological characterization of common species of Neotropical bats, and the first in providing hematological data for six species from three families of bats.",

            "abstractNote": "The airspace of the lower troposphere is an important habitat for many animals, including open-space foraging bats. Yet, we are missing a detailed understanding of how bats forage in the seemingly unstructured open space. As part of an exploratory study, we present data on flight activity for Taphozous theobaldi (Dobson 1872), an aerial insectivore known to hunt in the open space close to mountain ridges in central Thailand. Using logger data from five individuals, covering a total period of 26 observation days, we show that T. theobaldi remained airborne for 4.8 ± 3.1 h per night (mean ± SD). We confirmed that T. theobaldi performed altitudinal flights with quick ascents, short horizontal flights followed by descents. Each night, T. theobaldi engaged on average in 2.9 ± 1.4 altitudinal flights during which they reached an average peak altitude of 306 ± 53 m above cave elevation. On average, bats spent about 14% of the total foraging time in altitudinal flights. We conclude that T. theobaldi is a regular, but most likely not an obligatory exploiter of high altitudes. We speculate that T. theobaldi may ascend to higher altitudes in search for insects, for example migrating or dispersing insects at higher air layers or swarms of hill-topping insects. Short altitudinal flights with fast ascents and descents (a slender bell-shaped flight trajectory over several 100 m altitude) may present a so far unrecognized flight behaviour of bats that may be more widespread among other aerial insectivores.",

            "abstractNote": "Although cliffs may play an important role in bat ecology (offering natural roosting sites and thermally favourable foraging habitat), there are surprisingly few systematic investigations of bat activity in cliff habitats compared to other habitats. We carried out systematic recordings of bat calls at inland cliff habitats (comprising natural cliffs and quarries) and compared them to three other habitat types (water bodies, settlements and forests) in order to better understand the importance of cliff habitats for bats. A total of 38,440 call sequences were recorded during this study. Overall bat activity at cliff habitats was comparable to activity at water bodies and settlements but was much higher compared to forests. Median activity in forests was only 6% of that in other habitat types. In total, we recorded a minimum of 19 bat species (16 determined to the species level and three representing indistinguishable species pairs). At cliff habitats, 18 species were recorded, representing at least 75% of the 24 bat species with recent records from Carinthia, Austria, including many threatened species. Two species exhibited a significant preference for cliffs over other habitat types: Eptesicus serotinus and Hypsugo savii, the latter of which is known to be a cliff habitat specialist. Bat assemblages in cliff habitats and settlements tended to be more similar compared to other habitat types, a finding that may contribute to our understanding of the urban ecology of bats. The results of our study emphasise the importance of inland cliff habitats for bats and thus, the preservation of abandoned quarries is a significant conservation measure for bats. Moreover, studies focusing on possible negative impacts of rock climbing on bat activity and roosting behaviour of bats are needed.",

More than half of all bat species roost in foliage. Within the Neotropics, 17 species of bat are known to modify foliage into structures referred to as ‘tents’. Of these species, Thomas’s fruit eating bat (Dermanura watsoni) uses the widest range of plant species for roosts, constructing five different tent types. However, the factors influencing the distribution and quantity of tents are not fully understood for this species. The aims of our study were to investigate whether (1) micro-habitat characteristics influence the number of tents on individual plants and (2) macro-habitat features influence the frequency of plants used for tent-roosting in the surrounding landscape. Our results demonstrate that the distribution of tents was influenced by proximity to freshwater, with 48.8% of tents within 100 m of freshwater resources. Additionally, D. watsoni constructed tents in sheltered habitats with a high cover abundance of trees. These types of habitat areas should be targeted for conservation efforts to conserve this species.",

            "abstractNote": "Many terrestrial vertebrate species are exhibiting geographic distribution changes including poleward range limit shifts in response to increases in regional temperature. Bats are a highly mobile taxa capable of rapid responses to changes in abiotic or biotic conditions. In North America, recent extralimital records of the non-hibernating Lasiurus seminolus (Seminole bat) have been attributed to climate change, however such attributions remain speculative and potentially subject to sampling bias in the form of increased recent sampling efforts at latitudes north of the historical range. We used historical occurrence records and simple environmental variables within a Maxent modeling framework to model the historical distribution of suitable areas for this species. We transferred the model using near current environmental conditions and measured the ability of the model to capture the apparent expansion in distribution using recent extralimital occurrence records. Our model transferred well over time concluding that the distribution expansion may be largely attributed to increasing minimum temperatures. We used the model to forecast the expansion in distribution of suitable areas at three 20-year intervals and various climate change scenarios and provide extrapolation risk maps for each scenario. Although increasing temperatures may increase potentially occupiable areas, the species is associated with forests and often roosts in pines (Pinus spp.). This suitable habitat is more limited to the northwest of the species’ range, which may constrain the future species expansion despite favorable temperatures. We demonstrated this effect by mapping limiting factors through future climate change scenarios. We discovered a broad shift of effects that constrained the distribution from minimum temperature to an abundance metric of evergreen cover type as time and climate change intensity increased. Although uncertainties exist, we predict further expansion of the Seminole bat widely over the next 60 years across the eastern United States where suitable habitat and climate conditions converge. Our results appear consistent with other bat species showing similar range extensions and in turn provide further evidence that bats may serve as bioindicators of global change.",

Wind energy is a leading cause of bat mortality globally, yet little is known about the impacts to bats in Africa. I studied these impacts in South Africa to enhance knowledge on wind energy impacts on African bats. I reviewed data from 59 studies published in scientific journals and technical reports of operational monitoring of bat fatalities at wind turbines. Bat fatalities occurred at all operating wind energy facilities in South Africa. Tadarida aegyptiaca accounted for the majority of carcasses, followed by Neoromicia capensis and Miniopterus natalensis. The majority of fatalities were of non-migratory species and occurred between February and April although bats were killed in all months. Bat fatality differed between wind energy facilities in terms of observed fatality/year, estimated fatality/year and estimated fatality/MW/year but these differences could not be explained by broad scale vegetation patterns. Total estimated bat fatality between 2011 and 2020 was 12,601 bats. Mean fatality/MW/year was 2.8 bats. I estimate that between 2013 and 2050, a minimum of 996,974 bats may be killed at South African wind energy facilities. My results present the first estimates of the scale of potential wind energy impacts to bats in South Africa and the African continent.",

            "abstractNote": "Movements of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in and out of the nursery roost at Stackpole (West Wales, U.K.) were monitored automatically from 1994 to 2018 with simultaneous measurements of roost and external air temperatures. Pups were counted manually in June–July and mean birth dates calculated. Maximal foraging times of the population between 16:00 h and 08:00 h and temperatures at midnight showed three types of activity. These types of activity explained why warmer springs were followed by earlier birth dates. When April was warmer the number of degree days, linked to the activity of night-flying insects, was higher so the maximal foraging times were longer. Hence, mean birth dates were earlier due to faster gestation. The indirect effect of degree days on the birth date, measured by the partial regression coefficient (ß = -0.321), was weaker than the direct effect (ß = -0.628) and the mediating effect of maximal foraging time was significant (P < 0.001). During May–June and June–July bats foraged mainly from dusk to dawn so there was little variation in the maximal foraging times of the population, and it did not significantly mediate the effect of temperature on birth date. Birth dates were later when the external temperatures in June–July were higher (ß = 0.309), but the effect was small (R2 = 9.5%). Path analysis further revealed that longer maximal foraging times of the population in April predicted the year-to-year changes in the number of births and subsequently the number of adult females. Maximal foraging times of the population in April were a major influence on birth timing and ultimately determined whether the population grew or declined.",

            "abstractNote": "Mist nets set at ground level is the traditional method of surveying bats and in the Amazon, almost half of the bat surveys used this methodology. The sole use of ground-level mist nets biases surveys because of the lack of records of aerial insectivorous bats, which forage above the canopy or in other open areas. Canopy mist nets, roost searches and acoustic surveys are methods to survey bat assemblages, but their efficiency compared to ground-level mist nets has not been fully evaluated in the Amazon, the world’s largest tropical rainforest. Here, we test how the complementarity of sampling methods contributes to the number of species recorded in bat surveys in the Amazonian rainforest. We simultaneously sampled bats using ground mist nets and ultrasonic recorders at the Ducke Reserve (Central Amazon) in Brazil and did a literature review of bat surveys conducted in the Amazon to assess how these methods have been used in field research during the recent decades. Forty-three bat species were identified using ground mist nets, and seventeen species and five acoustic sonotypes were identified using ultrasonic recorders in Ducke Reserve. The combination of ground mist nets and acoustic recorders registered the largest number of bat species. However, for phyllostomid species the sole use of mist nets was efficient in recording the highest number of species, whereas for aerial insectivores acoustic surveys was the most effective. Of the 54 bat surveys made in the Amazon, 27 localities used complementary methods: roost search, canopy mist nets, harp traps and acoustic surveys. The combination of ground and canopy nets, and ground nets with roost search did not record more phyllostomid bat species than the use of ground nets alone. However, the sole use of acoustic surveys recorded more aerial insectivorous species than any other combination of sampling methods. Using mist nets and acoustic surveys simultaneously, as in our study, results in a dramatic increase in species diversity and different guilds than using only mist nets in the Amazon. Canopy nets and roost search did not increase the total number of species or the number of phyllostomid species in bat surveys. By combining different survey methodologies, we can optimize the recorded diversity of bats, especially using both mist nets and acoustic monitoring.",

            "abstractNote": "Micronycteris sanborni is an insectivorous bat known from dry phytogeographic domains in South America, although its distribution range is not yet well known. Here, we modelled the distribution of this species based on seven bioclimatic and vegetation predictors associated with its occurrence, using 26 sites where the species was recorded in the Caatinga (16), Cerrado (7), Chiquitano Dry Forest (2) and Pantanal (1). We used four different algorithms to build an ensemble distribution model, to estimate habitat suitability throughout its geographic occurrence and the area of habitat available inside protected areas. Our models showed excellent performance and highlighted the main importance of four environmental variables (other mixed trees, deciduous broadleaf trees, evergreen broadleaf trees, and precipitation of driest quarter), which accounted for more than 80% of the species presence probability. The distribution model indicated the potential occurrence of M. sanborni consistently across the dry diagonal of South America, but adequate habitat areas covered mainly the Caatinga and the northeast of Cerrado rather than the southwest, where suitable habitats were scattered and discontinuous. Less than 10% of the total habitat predicted for M. sanborni corresponded to protected areas. Our results support that M. sanborni mostly depends on woody and less dry environments across the South America dry diagonal, which raises concerns about its vulnerability due to high deforestation in the southwest and because severe dryness is forecast for the coming decades in the Brazilian northeast.",

This crustacean, endemic to Lake Baikal, performs vertical migrations in the water column at night and sometimes forms mass accumulations near its surface. The observations presented expand the prey list of the ‘trawling Myotis’ and also supplement the picture of trophic relationships of the pelagic organisms of the ancient and deep Lake Baikal with terrestrial vertebrates.",

            "abstractNote": "Network analysis has been used for understanding complex systems in biology for decades. However, scant information is available for networks of antagonistic interactions. The aim of this study was to describe and compare bat-ectoparasite interaction networks in tropical dry forests (TFDs) in the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga biomes, which have contrasting environmental conditions and surrounding matrix. Bats and ectoparasites were sampled at six sites in northern and central Minas Gerais State, southeast Brazil. Network connectance, nestedness and number of compartments were compared between regions, as well as bat species richness, abundance and centrality, and ectoparasite specialization. The effect of bat phylogenetic relatedness on the similarity of their associated ectoparasite species was also tested. Bat-ectoparasite networks were nested, connected and highly compartmentalized in TDFs from both regions, with no significant differences in network structure. In addition, host species richness negatively influenced nestedness and connectance, but was positively related to compartment number. These findings are likely related to the high specialization observed for bat-fly species (usually one exclusive parasite species per host), resulting in networks with few interactions. Bat abundance positively affected bat-fly richness, indicating that resource availability is important in determining hostparasite relationships. Finally, phylogenetically related species of bats possessed more similar ectoparasite faunas, which may be associated with evolutionary responses of ectoparasites to escape defensive mechanisms of different bat species. Our results suggest that local bat-ectoparasite interactions are influenced by both ecological factors and evolutionary constraints, but the effects of environmental conditions on network topology deserved further detailed studies.",

Our work in the midwestern region in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, showed a high richness of the bat fauna, given the anthropic impact caused by mineral exploration and agricultural activities, thus leaving vegetation islands over karst areas in a vast anthropized matrix. Sampling at 12 sites resulted in 1,444 captures of bats, representing 30 species. Our beta diversity partitioning analyses indicated a pattern of turnover, i.e. species replacement, suggesting that these vegetation fragments may function as ecological springboards or stopping points.",

These stem from research showing the behavioural responses of bats to acoustic stimuli, and are used as bat-attractants, usually in an effort to catch bats. Through an online survey, we aimed to inform best practice by accumulating user experiences. We received 55 responses to the survey from 21 countries. Lures have been used across 34 countries, but predominantly in the United Kingdom, across the European Union, and throughout the USA during bat community-focused surveys. With growing research that lures may attract some species whilst deterring others, lures may be more appropriately used for species-specific focused projects, rather than broader, bat community-focused projects. Over half of survey respondents expressed ethical concerns surrounding the use of bat lures, stating that their use should be limited due to a lack of understanding of their effects, and that they may alter the behaviour of bats due to stress. We encourage practitioners to use lures with some caution, and test their utility so that over time we understand these potential concerns with more certainty. To this end, we also recommend guidelines be published for general ethical use, alongside standardised methods to deepen our future understanding of these devices and their effect on bat species globally.",

The logistic growth model provided the best line of fit to the changes in the forearm lengths, indicated by the lowest standard error. Over the 20-year study period, the mean values of the logistic growth parameters were asymptotic length (L∞) = 55.10 mm and growth constant (K) = 0.11 day-1. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the most significant predictors of the variance in L∞ and K (R2 = 58.7% and 54.3%, respectively) were the nursery roost temperatures at midnight, and the total foraging times of the adult bats during the night. If the juveniles were born early, when the roost temperature was colder, and the foraging times of the adults were shorter, then a lower value of K produced forearms that grew toward a longer L∞. If the juveniles were born late, when the roost temperature was warmer, and the foraging times of the adults were longer, then a higher value of K produced forearms that grew toward a shorter L∞. Reasons are proposed to explain the differences between the growth of early and late born individuals, including the effect of increased body mass associated with warmer roost temperatures and possible causes of longer foraging times.",

            "abstractNote": "Acoustic lures, using a range of bat social, feeding and distress calls, are being used increasingly to improve capture rates in surveys and ecological studies of bats globally. However, much information on their effectiveness is anecdotal. We tested the effectiveness of the Sussex Autobat acoustic lure system using a standard Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii) social call for catching two rare and endangered New Zealand bat species, the long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) and lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) during lactation and post-lactation periods. The long-tailed bat forages primarily along forest edges, whereas the lesser short-tailed bat forages largely within cluttered forest interiors. Harp traps were set in paired locations over 18 nights in each of the late-lactation and post-lactation periods with an equal treatment/control (lure/no lure) sampling design. Sixty-four long-tailed bats and 97 lesser short-tailed bats were captured, with 100% of long-tailed bats and 93% of short-tailed bats being caught while using acoustic lures. Lesser short-tailed bats were caught more frequently than long-tailed bats, perhaps reflecting the greater abundance of lesser short-tailed bats. Captures were biased towards juveniles and males in both species, regardless of sampling period. Capture rates using lures were about 100 times higher than catch-rates from ‘expert-placed’ traps. Further research is needed to determine (a) if calls of New Zealand bat species (or other calls) can be used to increase capture rates further, and (b) if capture rates of female bats can be improved.",

We monitored bat activity at four feeders with trail cameras or security cameras all night for 19–57 nights during the 2021 ‘nectar bat season’. As in previous years, peak visits occurred in midSeptember. Detailed analysis of data from one feeder on 22 nights indicated that non-adults (juveniles and yearlings) were visiting it and that visitation patterns were highly variable from night to night. Statistical analysis of these patterns revealed that clusters of bats were visiting this feeder more often than expected by chance, suggesting that bats are foraging in groups. Surprisingly, bats did not leave feeders once they were drained but continued to visit them for up to five hours each night. Energetic calculations suggest that some bats are potentially expending half of their foraging energy visiting empty feeders. Studies of individually tagged bats are needed to begin to understand this behavior.",

Fleshy fruits eaten by these vertebrates are widely distributed throughout angiosperm phylogeny. Similarly, a frugivorous diet has evolved independently many times in birds and mammals. Bird dispersal is more common than mammal-dispersal in all lineages of angiosperms, and we suggest that the evolution of bird fruits may have facilitated the evolution of frugivory in primates. The diets of fruit-eating bats overlap less with those of other kinds of frugivorous vertebrates. With a few exceptions, most families producing vertebrate-dispersed fruit appeared substantially earlier in earth history than families of their vertebrate consumers. It is likely that major radiations of these plants and animals have occurred in the past 30 Ma, in part driven by geological changes and also by the foraging behavior of frugivores in topographically complex landscapes. Overall, this mutualistic interaction has had many evolutionary and ecological consequences for tropical plants and animals for most of the Cenozoic Era. Loss of frugivores and their dispersal services will have a strong negative impact on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of tropical and subtropical communities.",

            "abstractNote": "Energy produced by wind farms has diverse positive environmental effects, but can also be related to negative impacts, including wildlife mortality through collisions with wind turbines. Bird and bat mortality caused by collisions with wind turbines can be estimated indirectly by counting carcasses within wind farms. However, carcass removal by scavengers often biases such measurements. In this study, we identiﬁed the main scavengers removing bird and bat carcasses in a tropical wind farm. A known fate analysis was done to assess the effect of carcass type (i.e., small bird, large bird, bat), vegetation type (i.e., secondary vegetation, croplands) and season (dry and rainy seasons of 2009) on carcass persistence rates. We identiﬁed three main scavenger groups, with mammals being the most abundant group. Our results show high rates of carcass removal relative to previous studies, especially for bats; there were fewer remaining carcasses after 20 days in our tropical site than in non-tropical environments reported elsewhere. We found a higher carcass persistence rate during the rainy season than in the dry season, possibly due to a greater abundance of food resources for scavenger organisms in the rainy season. Although we found some evidence for higher persistence rates for large bird carcasses than for small bird and bat carcasses during the rainy season, overall carcass type was not a strong predictor of persistence rates. Similarly, we did not ﬁnd a strong effect of vegetation type on carcass persistence rates. Results suggest that in order to estimate accurate bird and bat mortality in tropical wind farm areas, seasonality should be incorporated to correction factors of carcass removal rates.",
