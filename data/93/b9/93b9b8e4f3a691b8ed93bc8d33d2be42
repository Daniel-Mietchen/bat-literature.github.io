The goal of this paper was therefore to describe the helminth fauna of a common bat species from the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. We collected 63 individuals of the bat Tadarida brasiliensis in the municipality of Montenegro in March 2015 (33 males and 30 females; 41 adults and 22 juveniles). We identified 451 endoparasites belonging to eight species (i.e. Urotrema scabridum, Limatulum oklahomense, Postorchigenes paraguayensis, Parabascus limatulus, Ochoterenatrema sp., Vampirolepis decipiens, Tadaridanema delicatus, as well as one unidentified species representing the superfamily Microphalloidea). Based on their importance value, we classified two helminth species as ‘dominant’, four as ‘co-dominant’ and two as ‘subordinate’. Vampirolepis decipiens had both the highest prevalence (of 55.5%) and greatest abundance (3.52 parasites/host). We report for the first time P. limatulus in T. brasiliensis in Rio Grande do Sul. This study provides important base-line data to elucidate helminth infestations in T. brasiliensis in Brazil.",

Isolation calls are used by neonates to solicit maternal care. In some species, isolation calls contain individual signatures that allow the mother bat to distinguish its own offspring from others. Little is known, however, about whether echolocation precursors also contain individual signatures. This study examined the postnatal growth and ontogeny of vocalizations in free-ranging Kerivoula furva, a social bat that uses the furled leaves of banana plants as day roosts. We tested the hypothesis that echolocation precursors of K. furva pups contain individual signatures. We found pups of K. furva emitted both isolation calls and echolocation precursors on the day of birth, indicating the two types of call develop independently. The call parameters of the echolocation precursors changed as pups aged, with the frequency increasing and pulse duration decreasing. The echolocation precursors resemble adult echolocation calls when pups reach approximately 25−30 days old. The results also showed the parameters of echolocation precursors differ significantly among pups that roosted together. We suggest echolocation precursors might function as communication signals for mother-offspring recognition.",

Similarly, forests in South Africa form a valuable biome supporting unique biotic diversity, yet forest bat communities have not previously been surveyed. We sampled 17 forests, of seven forest types and three forest groups, in the Eastern Cape and southern KwaZulu-Natal provinces, located within the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany global biodiversity hotspot. We utilized capture and acoustic survey methods to compile the first bat species inventory for these forests. Species identification was performed with a combined approach of morphology, echolocation, and DNA barcodes. With this we contributed novel DNA barcodes to the Barcode of Life Data System. A total of 25 species was recorded, with range extensions southward into the Eastern Cape for six species, indicating the region to be more diverse than previously thought. Updated modelled distribution maps for these species are presented. We compiled the first reference call library of hand released bats for South African forest habitats, and the southeast region of the country. We compared species richness, diversity, and dissimilarity of the forest types and found that Scarp forests host the highest species richness and diversity. Patterns of species assemblage similarities between forest groups are attributed to forest biogeographical history and historical dispersal routes of forest fauna. A comprehensive survey, such as this, may assist in the compilation and implementation of forest conservation management plans and future monitoring programs.",

Here we assessed the influence of elevation and forest cover on occupancy and the effect of lunar illumination on detectability of bat species in the Northern Andes of Peru. We captured 1,052 bats, belonging to three families and 26 species, over two survey periods (2008−2010 and 2014−2015) at 14 sites. The most detected species were the frugivorous Artibeus glaucus, Carollia brevicauda, C. perspicillata, Platyrrhinus ismaeli, P. nigellus, Sturnira erythromos, and S. oporaphilum. Detection probability (p) of both Artibeus planirostris, C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata were significantly related to the survey period, while S. erythromos and S. oporaphilum detectability was associated with lunar illumination. Elevation was marginally positively associated with S. erythromos occupancy, with a moderate relative explanatory power based on AICc weight. We did not find support for an effect of forest cover on bat occupancy. The estimation of both bat occupancy (ψ) and detectability (p) provides the basis for the design of monitoring programs with a spatiotemporal approach and constitutes a critical component in the context of land-use change and changing climate. For bat species in montane habitats, we suggest that S. erythromos is a useful species for use in monitoring programs, based on both occupancy, and detection probability, as well as its adaptability to montane areas.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are the second most diverse and widely distributed group of mammals, and may be directly or indirectly involved in some zoonotic diseases. Their baseline hematological knowledge and health condition in natural populations are important parameters, but when bats and humans cohabitate common spaces such as houses, buildings, and recreational parks, these variables become essential. Blood samples of bats representing 16 species from families Phyllostomidae (nine species; n = 104 individuals), Noctilionidae (two species; n = 24), and Molossidae (five species; n = 9) were obtained from 137 individuals captured in humanrelated spaces mostly in Mérida state, Venezuela. Hematocrit (Hct), total white blood cell counts (WBC), and differential white blood cell counts (DWBC) were quantified, and profiles compared in groups with large samples sizes and unambiguous reproductive conditions. Also, a general examination of blood smears was performed to assess the viability of in situ hemopathogen identification. Hct (0 ± SEM) of bats was 51.0 ± 1.9% for Artibeus lituratus (n = 53) and 51.0 ± 3.8% for A. jamaicensis (n = 18), the two most common bat species captured. WBC were higher in Phyllostomidae than in the other two families, and most species exhibited a DWBC formula dominated by lymphocytes. Lactating and pregnant females of A. lituratus showed higher values of neutrophiles than males and non-reproductive females. Overall, blood cell morphology and hematological profiles were consistent with those of other species of bats and/or mammals. Hemopathogens were observed in 19 individuals from three species. In this study, we report Anaplasma-compliant observations in blood samples of bats, but this first report requires molecular validation and further research to expand the knowledge on hemopathogens of bats. Our research is an important contribution to the hematological characterization of common species of Neotropical bats, and the first in providing hematological data for six species from three families of bats.",

            "abstractNote": "The airspace of the lower troposphere is an important habitat for many animals, including open-space foraging bats. Yet, we are missing a detailed understanding of how bats forage in the seemingly unstructured open space. As part of an exploratory study, we present data on flight activity for Taphozous theobaldi (Dobson 1872), an aerial insectivore known to hunt in the open space close to mountain ridges in central Thailand. Using logger data from five individuals, covering a total period of 26 observation days, we show that T. theobaldi remained airborne for 4.8 ± 3.1 h per night (mean ± SD). We confirmed that T. theobaldi performed altitudinal flights with quick ascents, short horizontal flights followed by descents. Each night, T. theobaldi engaged on average in 2.9 ± 1.4 altitudinal flights during which they reached an average peak altitude of 306 ± 53 m above cave elevation. On average, bats spent about 14% of the total foraging time in altitudinal flights. We conclude that T. theobaldi is a regular, but most likely not an obligatory exploiter of high altitudes. We speculate that T. theobaldi may ascend to higher altitudes in search for insects, for example migrating or dispersing insects at higher air layers or swarms of hill-topping insects. Short altitudinal flights with fast ascents and descents (a slender bell-shaped flight trajectory over several 100 m altitude) may present a so far unrecognized flight behaviour of bats that may be more widespread among other aerial insectivores.",

            "abstractNote": "Although cliffs may play an important role in bat ecology (offering natural roosting sites and thermally favourable foraging habitat), there are surprisingly few systematic investigations of bat activity in cliff habitats compared to other habitats. We carried out systematic recordings of bat calls at inland cliff habitats (comprising natural cliffs and quarries) and compared them to three other habitat types (water bodies, settlements and forests) in order to better understand the importance of cliff habitats for bats. A total of 38,440 call sequences were recorded during this study. Overall bat activity at cliff habitats was comparable to activity at water bodies and settlements but was much higher compared to forests. Median activity in forests was only 6% of that in other habitat types. In total, we recorded a minimum of 19 bat species (16 determined to the species level and three representing indistinguishable species pairs). At cliff habitats, 18 species were recorded, representing at least 75% of the 24 bat species with recent records from Carinthia, Austria, including many threatened species. Two species exhibited a significant preference for cliffs over other habitat types: Eptesicus serotinus and Hypsugo savii, the latter of which is known to be a cliff habitat specialist. Bat assemblages in cliff habitats and settlements tended to be more similar compared to other habitat types, a finding that may contribute to our understanding of the urban ecology of bats. The results of our study emphasise the importance of inland cliff habitats for bats and thus, the preservation of abandoned quarries is a significant conservation measure for bats. Moreover, studies focusing on possible negative impacts of rock climbing on bat activity and roosting behaviour of bats are needed.",

An extinct Quaternary species, M. besaoka, was considered morphologically distinct from modern Macronycteris based on its robust mandibles and wider molars. Since its description, taxonomic and phylogenetic revisions have reshaped our understanding of Malagasy Macronycteris. This included the discovery of the cryptic species M. cryptovalorona and the recognition of two clades within M. commersoni. Recent augmentation of museum cranial collections of Malagasy members of the genus has permitted renewed investigation into morphological trends. Herein, we examine craniodental morphology of modern Malagasy Macronycteris spp., and investigate the validity of M. besaoka through nonparametric multivariate methods. The results of this study support M. besaoka as a valid species. Further, some specimens previously diagnosed as M. besaoka are best associated with modern M. commersoni from the dry bioclimatic zone. These results have implications for the history of the bat community at Anjohibe Cave, as well as the identification of other Macronycteris subfossils from dry western Madagascar.",

            "abstractNote": "Extensive areas of old forests have declined all over the temperate regions of Europe mainly due to extensive forestry. This is likely to have negative impact on bats that roost in trees, such as the western barbastelle Barbastella barbastellus. We investigated its selection of summer roosts in a commercially used landscape in southern Sweden. We captured and radio-tracked 14 bats and found 17 occupied roosts. Nine of the roosts, including two used by a maternity colony (ca. 30 females), were located between overlapping boards on the gables of barns. The remaining eight roosts, all used by single individuals, were under lose bark on thin trees (DBH = 0.2−0.35 m). All recorded roosts had entrances pointing downwards, were adjacent to deciduous trees providing protective darkness, and were in areas without artificial lighting. In the barns, the bats avoided the northern aspect, which is the lightest (sun sets in the NW and rises in the NE). Roost temperatures did not differ between tree- and barn roosts. Average ambient light intensity on emergence and return was 13.3 lux (SD = 10.1 lux). Roosts in trees and barns shared common physical characteristics, yet despite this both maternity roosts were located in barns, perhaps because such roosts had more space than available tree roosts. Our results suggest that in areas deprived of large trees and extensive old forest, barbastelle shows flexibility in roost selection, although they consistently avoid artificial lights of all kinds. An abundance of potential roosts in trees and buildings and absence of light pollution are therefore key elements in a holistic conservation program for this species.",

However, caves remain some of the least known and most threatened environments globally. Documenting the richness of bat species in caves is important not only to draw attention to the uniqueness and relevance of these roosts, but it also contributes to the identification of priority sites for the conservation of bats and the cave fauna dependent upon them. Here, we assessed and described an exceptionally high bat richness in a group of caves in southeastern Tocantins, central Brazil. Inventories carried out in 19 caves resulted in seven families and 31 bat species, of which three were new regional records. Twelve caves were used by threatened and endangered bat species, eight had high diversity indices, and seven caves had high species richness, including one cave that may hold a world record with 26 bat species found inside. The variation in beta diversity is mainly due to species turnover, which indicates that protecting the largest possible number of caves would be ideal for the most efficient conservation of local bat assemblages. The sampled region stands out for its high potential for the conservation of endangered species, and we strongly recommend the full protection of 15 caves classified as a priority for conservation.",

More than half of all bat species roost in foliage. Within the Neotropics, 17 species of bat are known to modify foliage into structures referred to as ‘tents’. Of these species, Thomas’s fruit eating bat (Dermanura watsoni) uses the widest range of plant species for roosts, constructing five different tent types. However, the factors influencing the distribution and quantity of tents are not fully understood for this species. The aims of our study were to investigate whether (1) micro-habitat characteristics influence the number of tents on individual plants and (2) macro-habitat features influence the frequency of plants used for tent-roosting in the surrounding landscape. Our results demonstrate that the distribution of tents was influenced by proximity to freshwater, with 48.8% of tents within 100 m of freshwater resources. Additionally, D. watsoni constructed tents in sheltered habitats with a high cover abundance of trees. These types of habitat areas should be targeted for conservation efforts to conserve this species.",

            "abstractNote": "Roads have a multitude of negative effects on wildlife, including bat casualties. Most bat species rely on life history traits characterised by high adult survival (associated with greater longevity) and low reproduction rates (hence slow population growth rates). Therefore, road kills are expected to negatively affect local abundance and bat population dynamics. Bat overpasses are among the proposed improvements intended to increase bat flight height to reduce collisions, but their effectiveness has rarely been tested. In this study, we performed a before-after analysis to assess the effectiveness of one bat overpass on bat flight height. We used a novel approach, the bat tracking toolbox (BTT), to reconstruct bat flight paths from thermal videos. We obtained 268 bat flight paths and our results showed that the flight height of bats increased significantly after the installation of the bat overpass. Considering that bat overpasses can help in some situations to increase habitat connectivity and reduce the collision risk, this mitigation measure needs to be further investigated in different contexts of road construction and/or road requalification.",

They were captured over one night each month (November 2016 to November 2017). Based on the monthly average precipitation, the dry (September to February) and rainy (March to August) months were grouped. Through external body morphology, females were classified as inactive, pregnant, lactating, and post-lactating. Only the inactive (n = 13) were euthanized for morphophysiological analyzes. Blood samples were obtained for estrogen measurement and, after euthanasia, the ovaries were collected and processed by routine histological techniques. In morphometry, were considered: the area of the ovary, the presence, and the area of the ovarian follicles (unilaminar and multilaminar primary, antral, and Graafian), as well as the quantification of the corpus luteum. In immunohistochemistry, PCNA (Proliferating cell nuclear antigen) was used. The results showed pregnant females only in dry months, however inactive, lactating, and post-lactating females were collected in dry and rainy months. Estrogen levels and the presence of positive PCNA cells were higher in the rainy months. The Graafian follicle occurred only in these months, whereas the corpus luteum was found in all specimens from the dry months. Although A. planirostris has a tendency to start gestation in dry months and mating from mid to the end of the rainy months, this species showed adaptability influenced by environmental variations throughout the reproductive cycle, indicating a aseasonal polyestry.",

            "abstractNote": "Nycteris madagascariensis is an enigmatic bat species, described as endemic to Madagascar and known only from two century-old specimens. Vigorous recent efforts to document this species on the island have proven unsuccessful. We extracted DNA from the fluid-preserved paratype of this taxon and used high-throughput sequencing methods to recover cytochrome b sequence data, which was overlaid on an extensive phylogeny of Afrotropical Nycteris. We also analyzed craniodental measurements of both Malagasy and Afrotropical Nycteris using principal components analysis and one-way ANOVAs. Both genetic and morphological analyses unequivocally place N. madagascariensis in a clade otherwise known only from eastern and coastal Kenya. Review of the collector’s notes and itinerary raises doubts on the accuracy of its having originated in Madagascar; the hypodigm was probably collected during his travels in coastal East Africa. We therefore place Nycteris madagascariensis G. Grandidier, 1937 in the synonymy of N. macrotis sensu lato and remove this species from the bat fauna of Madagascar.",

            "abstractNote": "The alteration of landscape by anthropogenic activity has reduced the foraging habitats of insectivorous bats. Thus it is important to understand the habitat selections of insectivorous bats and patterns of prey availability, especially in human-altered environments. We investigated bat activity in five classified habitats, namely: old-growth forest, remnant forest, citrus orchard, cornfield and paddy field in the forest-dominated Himalayan country of Bhutan. We monitored bat activity acoustically across 120 sites from May to November 2018. Thirteen different taxa and one unknown QCF bat were identified from 2,558 bat passes. Overall bat activity was dominated by open-space foragers such as Scotophilus kuhlii, Taphozous sp., Otomops wroughtoni and Nyctalus leisleri, showing comparative variations in habitat selection. But, Rhinolophus specifically, R. luctus was rarely present in open habitats such as cornfield and paddy fields, and was found to be one of the most abundant species in cluttered habitats, e.g., old-growth forest and remnant forest. Bat activity was higher in old-growth forest compared to paddy and remnant forest, but was not significantly different from cornfield and citrus orchard. Insect biomass positively correlated with bat activity. Our findings suggest that the habitat selection of insectivorous bats is influenced by prey abundance and habitat types. Although remnant forest was poorly associated with insect prey, the species richness of bats found there was almost equal to that of old-growth forest. Thus, remnant forest was found to be an important habitat, apparently serving as a corridor for the narrow-space foragers in the study landscape in Bhutan.",

            "abstractNote": "Mate attraction via chemosignalling is common in group-living mammals. In the greater short-nosed fruit bats, Cynopterus sphinx, it remains unclear whether males use chemosignals to attract females. Here, we use field observations to describe patterns of male chemosignalling in this species, then use preference test in captivity to infer the function of chemosignals. We observed that males engage in chemosignalling through wing fanning after marking their leaf ‘tent’ roosts with saliva. The male fanned each wing alternatively and vigorously and performed frequent tongue flicks to the wing membrane. Such behaviour is exhibited towards females that returned to the tent. Afterwards, the male embraced the female with both wings. Wing fanning and tent marking occurred more often during the mating season than the non-mating season. To infer the role of chemosignals in recruiting females, we performed two different choice tests. In the first test, we tested whether females preferred the tent containing cotton balls that were rubbed gently and repeatedly on the ventral side of the plagiopatagium of the male, versus a control tent without any conspecific odour. In the second test, we tested whether females preferred a tent that was marked by a male’s saliva versus a control tent without such markings. The result of both tests indicated that females recognized the saliva and ‘scent’ from the wings of males, since females always preferred tents with male chemosignals over the controls. Our findings suggest that the recruitment of females and subsequent formation of a harem in the greater short-nosed fruit bats is influenced by male chemosignals.",

Many studies have demonstrated how this approach causes sampling bias, is labor-intensive and increases the risk of white-nose syndrome fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, transmission among bats. Increasingly, acoustic devices are being employed to collect data on bat activity and richness. Community-based monitoring is an important data collection source for bat monitoring programs in countries such as the UK (National Bat Monitoring Program), whereby walking bat transects are conducted using bat detectors. Since the launch of smartphone devices to record and auto-identify bat echolocation calls, the quality of data collection that community members can collect has increased significantly, however, this approach is seldom used to generate data in scientific studies. In our study, we have showcased how our study design paired with state of the art acoustic monitoring devices, can be applied to community-based monitoring of bats across the world. Through employing smartphone acoustic devices, we have determined how primary and secondary vegetation cover are predictors of bat species occurrence and identified the importance of riverine and deciduous swamp habitats for rare bat species in southwestern Ontario.",

Currently, eight styles of tents are known, and their descriptions are based on leaf size, shape, and the number of cuts needed to create it. Here, we describe the preference for the construction, tent design, and occupation of palmate umbrella tents that A. watsoni built in two sympatric Carludovica species in a Costa Rican tropical rainforest. We predicted a preference by A. watsoni to build tents between the sympatric Carludovica species due to leaf differences or other variables of selection. We also explored the spatial distribution of multiple tent designs. Ten rectangular plots (500 × 20 m) were established, and we counted the number of plants, leaves, and tents of each plant species, as well as to explored the spatial distribution of the tent designs. We found a total of 1787 plants (9222 leaves) of C. drudei and 640 plants (3732 leaves) of C. rotundifolia. The proportion of tents per leaf in each plant species was significantly higher in C. drudei than in C. rotundifolia, and those differences were significant (Z = -2.83, d.f. = 4, P < 0.01). We described six tent designs for the umbrella architecture (semicircle, combined, heart, triangle, spatula, and partial). The abundance of these designs varied significantly between the Carludovica species. Our results suggest that A. watsoni exhibits a preference among sympatric plants of the same genus. However, this is a complex and dynamic process that depends on multiple variables. This is the first study systematically describing the tent designs that A. watsoni creates within the palmate umbrella tents. These findings contribute to the knowledge of tent roosting bats in the Neotropics and provide more insight into the complexity of their behavior.",

            "abstractNote": "Many terrestrial vertebrate species are exhibiting geographic distribution changes including poleward range limit shifts in response to increases in regional temperature. Bats are a highly mobile taxa capable of rapid responses to changes in abiotic or biotic conditions. In North America, recent extralimital records of the non-hibernating Lasiurus seminolus (Seminole bat) have been attributed to climate change, however such attributions remain speculative and potentially subject to sampling bias in the form of increased recent sampling efforts at latitudes north of the historical range. We used historical occurrence records and simple environmental variables within a Maxent modeling framework to model the historical distribution of suitable areas for this species. We transferred the model using near current environmental conditions and measured the ability of the model to capture the apparent expansion in distribution using recent extralimital occurrence records. Our model transferred well over time concluding that the distribution expansion may be largely attributed to increasing minimum temperatures. We used the model to forecast the expansion in distribution of suitable areas at three 20-year intervals and various climate change scenarios and provide extrapolation risk maps for each scenario. Although increasing temperatures may increase potentially occupiable areas, the species is associated with forests and often roosts in pines (Pinus spp.). This suitable habitat is more limited to the northwest of the species’ range, which may constrain the future species expansion despite favorable temperatures. We demonstrated this effect by mapping limiting factors through future climate change scenarios. We discovered a broad shift of effects that constrained the distribution from minimum temperature to an abundance metric of evergreen cover type as time and climate change intensity increased. Although uncertainties exist, we predict further expansion of the Seminole bat widely over the next 60 years across the eastern United States where suitable habitat and climate conditions converge. Our results appear consistent with other bat species showing similar range extensions and in turn provide further evidence that bats may serve as bioindicators of global change.",

            "abstractNote": "Short-tailed fruit bats typically breed twice a year, fitting a seasonal bimodal polyestry pattern in many ecosystems along their distributional range. For two species, Carollia perspicillata and C. benkeithi, reproductive timing was studied on a monthly basis and related to environmental seasonality (climatic factors and fruit resource availability) in a Peruvian premontane forest with a secondary succession plant composition. Sex, age and reproductive condition were assessed through morphological inspection. Plant species, whose fruits were known to be consumed by these bats, were scored for fruit resource availability. For C. perspicillata, lactation followed a bimodal pattern with peaks at the onset (September−October) and the middle of the rainy season (February–March). The proportion of lactating females was positively correlated with rainfall, temperature and fruit resource availability. In contrast, reproductive males, as indicated by descended testes, occurred during the dry season and its proportion was negatively correlated with rainfall. For C. benkeithi, records of reproductive females suggest that births also occur during the rainy season. This study supports the previously suggested synchronization of births with higher fruit resource availability for Carollia species, and contributes with information about the geographic variation of their reproductive phenology.",

Wind energy is a leading cause of bat mortality globally, yet little is known about the impacts to bats in Africa. I studied these impacts in South Africa to enhance knowledge on wind energy impacts on African bats. I reviewed data from 59 studies published in scientific journals and technical reports of operational monitoring of bat fatalities at wind turbines. Bat fatalities occurred at all operating wind energy facilities in South Africa. Tadarida aegyptiaca accounted for the majority of carcasses, followed by Neoromicia capensis and Miniopterus natalensis. The majority of fatalities were of non-migratory species and occurred between February and April although bats were killed in all months. Bat fatality differed between wind energy facilities in terms of observed fatality/year, estimated fatality/year and estimated fatality/MW/year but these differences could not be explained by broad scale vegetation patterns. Total estimated bat fatality between 2011 and 2020 was 12,601 bats. Mean fatality/MW/year was 2.8 bats. I estimate that between 2013 and 2050, a minimum of 996,974 bats may be killed at South African wind energy facilities. My results present the first estimates of the scale of potential wind energy impacts to bats in South Africa and the African continent.",

            "abstractNote": "Movements of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in and out of the nursery roost at Stackpole (West Wales, U.K.) were monitored automatically from 1994 to 2018 with simultaneous measurements of roost and external air temperatures. Pups were counted manually in June–July and mean birth dates calculated. Maximal foraging times of the population between 16:00 h and 08:00 h and temperatures at midnight showed three types of activity. These types of activity explained why warmer springs were followed by earlier birth dates. When April was warmer the number of degree days, linked to the activity of night-flying insects, was higher so the maximal foraging times were longer. Hence, mean birth dates were earlier due to faster gestation. The indirect effect of degree days on the birth date, measured by the partial regression coefficient (ß = -0.321), was weaker than the direct effect (ß = -0.628) and the mediating effect of maximal foraging time was significant (P < 0.001). During May–June and June–July bats foraged mainly from dusk to dawn so there was little variation in the maximal foraging times of the population, and it did not significantly mediate the effect of temperature on birth date. Birth dates were later when the external temperatures in June–July were higher (ß = 0.309), but the effect was small (R2 = 9.5%). Path analysis further revealed that longer maximal foraging times of the population in April predicted the year-to-year changes in the number of births and subsequently the number of adult females. Maximal foraging times of the population in April were a major influence on birth timing and ultimately determined whether the population grew or declined.",

            "abstractNote": "Mist nets set at ground level is the traditional method of surveying bats and in the Amazon, almost half of the bat surveys used this methodology. The sole use of ground-level mist nets biases surveys because of the lack of records of aerial insectivorous bats, which forage above the canopy or in other open areas. Canopy mist nets, roost searches and acoustic surveys are methods to survey bat assemblages, but their efficiency compared to ground-level mist nets has not been fully evaluated in the Amazon, the world’s largest tropical rainforest. Here, we test how the complementarity of sampling methods contributes to the number of species recorded in bat surveys in the Amazonian rainforest. We simultaneously sampled bats using ground mist nets and ultrasonic recorders at the Ducke Reserve (Central Amazon) in Brazil and did a literature review of bat surveys conducted in the Amazon to assess how these methods have been used in field research during the recent decades. Forty-three bat species were identified using ground mist nets, and seventeen species and five acoustic sonotypes were identified using ultrasonic recorders in Ducke Reserve. The combination of ground mist nets and acoustic recorders registered the largest number of bat species. However, for phyllostomid species the sole use of mist nets was efficient in recording the highest number of species, whereas for aerial insectivores acoustic surveys was the most effective. Of the 54 bat surveys made in the Amazon, 27 localities used complementary methods: roost search, canopy mist nets, harp traps and acoustic surveys. The combination of ground and canopy nets, and ground nets with roost search did not record more phyllostomid bat species than the use of ground nets alone. However, the sole use of acoustic surveys recorded more aerial insectivorous species than any other combination of sampling methods. Using mist nets and acoustic surveys simultaneously, as in our study, results in a dramatic increase in species diversity and different guilds than using only mist nets in the Amazon. Canopy nets and roost search did not increase the total number of species or the number of phyllostomid species in bat surveys. By combining different survey methodologies, we can optimize the recorded diversity of bats, especially using both mist nets and acoustic monitoring.",

            "abstractNote": "Micronycteris sanborni is an insectivorous bat known from dry phytogeographic domains in South America, although its distribution range is not yet well known. Here, we modelled the distribution of this species based on seven bioclimatic and vegetation predictors associated with its occurrence, using 26 sites where the species was recorded in the Caatinga (16), Cerrado (7), Chiquitano Dry Forest (2) and Pantanal (1). We used four different algorithms to build an ensemble distribution model, to estimate habitat suitability throughout its geographic occurrence and the area of habitat available inside protected areas. Our models showed excellent performance and highlighted the main importance of four environmental variables (other mixed trees, deciduous broadleaf trees, evergreen broadleaf trees, and precipitation of driest quarter), which accounted for more than 80% of the species presence probability. The distribution model indicated the potential occurrence of M. sanborni consistently across the dry diagonal of South America, but adequate habitat areas covered mainly the Caatinga and the northeast of Cerrado rather than the southwest, where suitable habitats were scattered and discontinuous. Less than 10% of the total habitat predicted for M. sanborni corresponded to protected areas. Our results support that M. sanborni mostly depends on woody and less dry environments across the South America dry diagonal, which raises concerns about its vulnerability due to high deforestation in the southwest and because severe dryness is forecast for the coming decades in the Brazilian northeast.",

This crustacean, endemic to Lake Baikal, performs vertical migrations in the water column at night and sometimes forms mass accumulations near its surface. The observations presented expand the prey list of the ‘trawling Myotis’ and also supplement the picture of trophic relationships of the pelagic organisms of the ancient and deep Lake Baikal with terrestrial vertebrates.",

            "abstractNote": "In the southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern USA, bat communities in high-elevation habitats tend to be relatively under-surveyed. High-elevation habitats may provide important habitat to certain species (i.e., migratory tree bats), and may serve as climate refugia during droughts or high temperatures. We conducted an opportunistic acoustic survey of bat communities in ten survey areas in high elevation (1,585–1,920 m a.s.l.) montane Picea rubens (red spruce)-Abies fraseri (Fraser fir) forest in the southern Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina. In each survey area, we randomly placed three full spectrum acoustic detectors (N = 30) during three seasons (spring, summer and fall) in 2015. We deployed each detector for two five-day periods during each season (n = 900 survey nights). Although we detected seven bat species/groups during the surveys, 73% of echolocation files were attributed to Lasiurus cinereus (hoary bat) and Lasionycteris noctivagans (silver-haired bat). Generally rare in the Appalachians and typically present only at low densities in the summer at mid- and low-elevations, both species were detected at all sites during all seasons. Overall, mean nightly activity of bats was higher in the summer than the spring or fall. We observed 3.7–5 times greater activity of L. cinereus in spruce-fir forests during the summer compared to spring and fall, whereas L. noctivagans had 1.3–5 times more activity in the summer compared to other seasons. After accounting for precipitation events, our finite mixture models showed that season, temperature, elevation, and canopy height influenced L. cinereus activity, whereas season and temperature affected L. noctivagans activity. Our observations suggest that high-elevation spruce-fir forests are providing summer foraging and possibly day-roosting habitat of tree bats not previously documented this far south in North America.",

However, scant information is available for networks of antagonistic interactions. The aim of this study was to describe and compare bat-ectoparasite interaction networks in tropical dry forests (TFDs) in the Brazilian Cerrado and Caatinga biomes, which have contrasting environmental conditions and surrounding matrix. Bats and ectoparasites were sampled at six sites in northern and central Minas Gerais State, southeast Brazil. Network connectance, nestedness and number of compartments were compared between regions, as well as bat species richness, abundance and centrality, and ectoparasite specialization. The effect of bat phylogenetic relatedness on the similarity of their associated ectoparasite species was also tested. Bat-ectoparasite networks were nested, connected and highly compartmentalized in TDFs from both regions, with no significant differences in network structure. In addition, host species richness negatively influenced nestedness and connectance, but was positively related to compartment number. These findings are likely related to the high specialization observed for bat-fly species (usually one exclusive parasite species per host), resulting in networks with few interactions. Bat abundance positively affected bat-fly richness, indicating that resource availability is important in determining hostparasite relationships. Finally, phylogenetically related species of bats possessed more similar ectoparasite faunas, which may be associated with evolutionary responses of ectoparasites to escape defensive mechanisms of different bat species. Our results suggest that local bat-ectoparasite interactions are influenced by both ecological factors and evolutionary constraints, but the effects of environmental conditions on network topology deserved further detailed studies.",

Our work in the midwestern region in the state of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, showed a high richness of the bat fauna, given the anthropic impact caused by mineral exploration and agricultural activities, thus leaving vegetation islands over karst areas in a vast anthropized matrix. Sampling at 12 sites resulted in 1,444 captures of bats, representing 30 species. Our beta diversity partitioning analyses indicated a pattern of turnover, i.e. species replacement, suggesting that these vegetation fragments may function as ecological springboards or stopping points.",

The employment of diversified methods to be able to detect species, and of adequate sampling efforts is crucial for estimating the richness of bats occurring in highly complex tropical forests. We herein analyzed the richness of bats from one of the largest remnants of the semideciduous Atlantic Forest from Southeastern Brazil, the state conservation park called Parque Estadual do Rio Doce (PERD), based on data from the 1990s and from 2012 to 2016. Based on mixed sampling techniques, including ground-level and canopy nets, acoustic surveys, and roost searching we have revealed that this single state reserve of PERD has the highest bat richness recorded to date among semideciduous Atlantic Forest locations. A total of 54 bat species have been recorded for PERD, including two recently described species from the genera Thyroptera (Thyropteridae) and Eumops (Molossidae). Our data reinforce the value of diversifying sampling methods and the role of PERD as key area for the conservation of the Atlantic Forest biome.",

Based on field surveys undertaken throughout the country in 2014–2020 and using morphological (external, cranial and dental characters), genetic and acoustic data, we document the first records of six bat species nationally (Rhinolophus marshalli, R. siamensis, Hipposideros halophyllus, H. lekaguli, Cassistrellus yokdonensis and Eptesicus pachyomus) and the second in-country record for an additional species (Saccolaimus saccolaimus). All of these taxa were encountered in Cambodia’s understudied border regions where literature for neighbouring territories suggests future field research will likely reveal other bat species presently unknown in the country. We also comment on the distribution and conservation status of the newly documented taxa, provide a revised checklist of the 80 bat species now confirmed in Cambodia and briefly consider the prospects for future discoveries and bat conservation in the country.",

These aspects are critical for the maintenance of genetic diversity in populations. Ectophylla alba is a fruit bat belonging to the family Phyllostomidae with specialized feeding and habitat requirements. Studies examining population genetics in this specialist bat are lacking. In this study, ten microsatellite loci were used to evaluate the current genetic structure of this bat species. Six localities in Costa Rica were evaluated. These localities are included in a landscape with remnants of lowland forests surrounded by cattle pastures, plantations, urban areas, and roads. Our results suggest a genetic population with moderate genetic diversity that was observed at most studied loci, with a statistically non-significant difference between the observed and expected heterozygosity. Most of the genetic variation was observed within rather than among sampled populations. The Mantel test showed a non-significant correlation between genetic diversity and geographic distance. These results suggest that E. alba populations have not shown an effect of habitat fragmentation in the studied area. We argue that the increase of forest patches is too recent to alter genetic diversity among sampled localities. Current migration among populations appears to be high enough to balance allele frequencies among localities.",

            "abstractNote": "External ears in mammals direct and enhance perception of sound. In bats, where navigation and foraging are strongly contingent on reception of sound, we would expect correlations between bat external ear morphology and echolocation signal structure, acoustic and aerodynamic properties, and foraging strategies. Using Web search engines, we collected peer-reviewed literature on these relationships, with the aim of summarising the knowledge on these correlations and establishing general form-function patterns. The literature on the relationship echolocation-ear, and foraging strategy was scant (six and ten publications, respectively). Fifteen more examined the aerodynamic properties and 46 the acoustic properties. Because of the complexity of the subject, few attempts exist that examine ear properties (acoustic, aerodynamic, shape) at the same time for more than a few species. The number of species so far examined represents less than 15% of the total number of species of bats. Although the available information did not allow to propose general patterns of morphological response of external ears to the factors examined, our findings suggested that further analyses of the relationship form-function in bat ears should consider the study of ears as integrated, multivariate morphological entities in which shape, aerodynamic characteristics, and acoustic properties, are an integrated, multivariate whole that ultimately contributes to the bat foraging behaviour.",

Migratory birds use stopover sites to rest and refuel for subsequent migratory flights, but it isn’t clear what bats do during their comparatively brief stopovers. We used acoustic monitoring to compare activity patterns of migrating silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and resident big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) at Long Point, Ontario, Canada. From September 1 to October 31 2020 we recorded 4,333 echolocation passes from our two focal species and quatified feeding buzzes in those recordings. Migratory L. noctivagans passed through in two waves, one of which had been identified by previous study, and a second suggesting that the migratory period may be longer than previously identified. Eptesicus fuscus was primarily active only in the early and late parts of the night, in contrast to the activity pattern of L. noctivagans which were similarly active and foraging at dusk and dawn, but also during the middle parts of the night. Our acoustic monitoring data complement previous data collected from bat captures and radiotelemetry to provide further insight into stopover behaviors and ecology of temperate migratory bats.",

These stem from research showing the behavioural responses of bats to acoustic stimuli, and are used as bat-attractants, usually in an effort to catch bats. Through an online survey, we aimed to inform best practice by accumulating user experiences. We received 55 responses to the survey from 21 countries. Lures have been used across 34 countries, but predominantly in the United Kingdom, across the European Union, and throughout the USA during bat community-focused surveys. With growing research that lures may attract some species whilst deterring others, lures may be more appropriately used for species-specific focused projects, rather than broader, bat community-focused projects. Over half of survey respondents expressed ethical concerns surrounding the use of bat lures, stating that their use should be limited due to a lack of understanding of their effects, and that they may alter the behaviour of bats due to stress. We encourage practitioners to use lures with some caution, and test their utility so that over time we understand these potential concerns with more certainty. To this end, we also recommend guidelines be published for general ethical use, alongside standardised methods to deepen our future understanding of these devices and their effect on bat species globally.",

            "abstractNote": "Lonchophylla is a genus of currently 13 nectar-feeding bat species found throughout Central and South America, including Lonchophylla mordax Thomas, 1903, a species endemic to Brazil. Currently nationally categorized as ‘Data Deficient’, L. mordax has several knowledge gaps, including basic ones on its natural history. Here, we provide information on L. mordax’s pattern of nocturnal activity, reproductive peak, sex and age ratios, its relationship with ectoparasites, as well as its distribution and taxonomy. Fieldwork was conducted in the Caatinga (seasonally dry tropical forest) in north-eastern Brazil between 2012 and 2015, during which we captured 110 L. mordax individuals. Our results showed that there was no significant difference in body mass or forearm length between males and females, with a sex ratio of 1:1. We obtained four adult individuals for every subadult captured. Lonchophylla mordax individuals were active throughout the entire sample night period but with a significant peak in activity in the first 30 min after sunset. The number of captures was strongly negatively correlated with minutes after sunset. Pregnant females were captured between July and February, and subadults were captured mainly in July and August, suggesting that the peak of births occurred at the end of the dry period and the beginning of the rainy period in the study area. Additionally, almost 70% of L. mordax individuals were parasitized by streblid flies, with no significant difference in parasite load observed across seasons, sexes, and ages. However, the individuals’ body condition index was negatively correlated with the parasite load. Natural history research, such as that described here, helps to fill knowledge gaps on L. mordax, including providing data for the decision-making in conservation plans. Moreover, we add information for a species-rich genus with closely related, but poorly-studied, species globally listed as threatened or near-threatened.",

            "abstractNote": "We addressed the question of why juvenile R. ferrumequinum that are born early (May to early June) in the nursery roost at Stackpole, West Wales, tend to have a higher forearm growth rate than individuals born later (late June to July). An appropriate nonlinear growth equation (either logistic, Gompertz, von-Bertalanffy, or asymptotic regression) was identified to fit the measurements of the forearms of juvenile R. ferrumequinum collected from marked individuals at the roost between 1994 and 2013. The logistic growth model provided the best line of fit to the changes in the forearm lengths, indicated by the lowest standard error. Over the 20-year study period, the mean values of the logistic growth parameters were asymptotic length (L∞) = 55.10 mm and growth constant (K) = 0.11 day-1. Multiple regression analysis indicated that the most significant predictors of the variance in L∞ and K (R2 = 58.7% and 54.3%, respectively) were the nursery roost temperatures at midnight, and the total foraging times of the adult bats during the night. If the juveniles were born early, when the roost temperature was colder, and the foraging times of the adults were shorter, then a lower value of K produced forearms that grew toward a longer L∞. If the juveniles were born late, when the roost temperature was warmer, and the foraging times of the adults were longer, then a higher value of K produced forearms that grew toward a shorter L∞. Reasons are proposed to explain the differences between the growth of early and late born individuals, including the effect of increased body mass associated with warmer roost temperatures and possible causes of longer foraging times.",

            "abstractNote": "A Rhinolophus ferrumequinum maternity roost in Pembrokeshire, West Wales, U.K. was monitored from 1994 to 2023, as part of the U.K. national survey between days 92–112 (1 April = day 1). The onset of births, determined from pup forearm lengths, occurred earlier than anticipated in five years from days 63–77, in 1997, 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2014. In those five years between 0.5–20.6% of the exit count would have been pups 28–35 days old, which were nearly adult size and able to fly outside the roost (9.5 ± 8.5%, 0 ± SD). Since 2014 the population exceeded 650 adult bats and there was insufficient time to measure pup forearm lengths whilst adults were out of the roost so alternative methods of estimating birth timing were devised. Nightly external activity periods at the maternity roost identified the date when births commenced and presumed foraging activity changed from pre-partum, when bats were absent from dusk to dawn, to post-partum when mothers returned to feed their pups. Changes in the onset of early births were statistically related to changes in the integrated air temperature, defined as the accumulated temperature above a threshold in April of 7°C (degree days). A significant (P < 0.01) polynomial equation explained a moderate proportion (R2 = 33.6%) of the non-linear increase in the integrated air temperature over time. The probability of an early birth onset (P) was predicted by a significant (P = 0.014) binary logistic model. The odds of an early birth onset, relative to a later birth onset, was elevated by 1.04 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.08) for every one degree day increase in integrated air temperature. The probability of an early birth onset increased from P = 0.107 when the integrated air temperature was 38.7 degree days up to P = 0.942 when the integrated air temperature was 152.0 degree days. At the principal U.K. maternity roosts integrated air temperatures in April were in the same ranges annually from 2011 to 2023. Therefore, monitoring of the integrated air temperature in April provides a simple noninvasive method to predict the extent and pace of the shift in birth timing of R. ferrumequinum in future associated with climate change.",

            "abstractNote": "Acoustic lures, using a range of bat social, feeding and distress calls, are being used increasingly to improve capture rates in surveys and ecological studies of bats globally. However, much information on their effectiveness is anecdotal. We tested the effectiveness of the Sussex Autobat acoustic lure system using a standard Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii) social call for catching two rare and endangered New Zealand bat species, the long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) and lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) during lactation and post-lactation periods. The long-tailed bat forages primarily along forest edges, whereas the lesser short-tailed bat forages largely within cluttered forest interiors. Harp traps were set in paired locations over 18 nights in each of the late-lactation and post-lactation periods with an equal treatment/control (lure/no lure) sampling design. Sixty-four long-tailed bats and 97 lesser short-tailed bats were captured, with 100% of long-tailed bats and 93% of short-tailed bats being caught while using acoustic lures. Lesser short-tailed bats were caught more frequently than long-tailed bats, perhaps reflecting the greater abundance of lesser short-tailed bats. Captures were biased towards juveniles and males in both species, regardless of sampling period. Capture rates using lures were about 100 times higher than catch-rates from ‘expert-placed’ traps. Further research is needed to determine (a) if calls of New Zealand bat species (or other calls) can be used to increase capture rates further, and (b) if capture rates of female bats can be improved.",

Anthropogenic change negatively impacts surrounding landscapes, but in some cases, lead to an increase in synathropy. Bats are one such group that often take advantage of human altered landscapes, roosting in anthropogenic structures such as buildings and transportation infrastructure. However, less is known about how non-traditional or artificial roost sites may affect persistence of synathropic bat species. We conducted a literature review to evaluate the ecological relationship between bats and artificial roosts, specifically transportation structures, as they are often the only roost structures available in some landscapes. Our evaluation revealed that numerous studies on artificial roost selection have been conducted in the eastern region of North America, as well as abroad. Use of transportation structures by bats varies across landscapes, specifically due to variation in annual climate, availability of natural roosts, and bridge structure design. This review enhances our understanding of bat roost ecology, possible pitfalls of synanthropic behaviour, and identify trends related to bat-bridge associations that may improve conservation outcomes for synanthropic species.",

We monitored bat activity at four feeders with trail cameras or security cameras all night for 19–57 nights during the 2021 ‘nectar bat season’. As in previous years, peak visits occurred in midSeptember. Detailed analysis of data from one feeder on 22 nights indicated that non-adults (juveniles and yearlings) were visiting it and that visitation patterns were highly variable from night to night. Statistical analysis of these patterns revealed that clusters of bats were visiting this feeder more often than expected by chance, suggesting that bats are foraging in groups. Surprisingly, bats did not leave feeders once they were drained but continued to visit them for up to five hours each night. Energetic calculations suggest that some bats are potentially expending half of their foraging energy visiting empty feeders. Studies of individually tagged bats are needed to begin to understand this behavior.",

            "abstractNote": "Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is the difference in body size between males and females. One of the most studied patterns in allometric size difference between sexes is Rensch’s rule, which describes an increase of SSD with increasing species size when males are the larger sex. However, few studies have tested this rule in bats, and morphological structures other than body size have rarely been included. The objective of this paper was to analyze the patterns of SSD across 28 New World bat species and assess their conformity to Rensch’s rule. To do this, I obtained measurements of forearm length, length of the third digit, and length of the fifth digit from 1,151 bat specimens, and through t-tests and reduced major axis regressions, I analyzed patterns of SSD and Rensch’s rule. I found high variation in size and wing morphology, with a modest female-biased size in more than half the species, which fails to support Rensch’s rule. Larger wing structures in females can improve flight performance to overcome aerodynamic challenges during reproduction when carrying pups and foraging for food. Mechanisms other than body size in females, geographic variation, and the set of species selected may explain the isometric pattern between sexes, which invalidates Rensch’s rule for Neotropical bats. Further studies should encompass a broader range of bat species from different lineages, but it is also necessary to analyze SSD based on various traits related to resource use, such as wing and nasal morphology, as well as include the influence of geographic variation and environmental factors.",

At 3–4 weeks of age, when the mothers leave the pups in the colony and fly off to forage, the offspring actively seek contact with other members of the group. Adult males show no sign of avoidance or aggression toward the infants. They sniff, groom and huddle with them. An infant can remain in physical contact with an adult male for more than 50% of the time its mother is away. We found significant differences in the time infants spent with the three adult males of the group. One of them showed a much higher affiliation with infants than the others. At 100–120 days of age, the infants feed on solid food and start to fly. At this point, adult males begin to react aggressively to young males, and adult males exhibit mating behavior with young females.",

Additionally, we tried to understand the mechanism of the environmental contamination of bats. Therefore, the digestive and respiratory tracts from 81 adult bats belonging to 25 species were extracted for analysis. Bats were captured in different locations in the Brazilian Amazon (Altamira, Bragança, Brasil Novo, Medicilândia, Nova Timboteua, Placas, São Félix do Xingu, Uruará and Vitória do Xingu, all in the state of Pará). The results showed that all species were contaminated with MPs in at least one of the analyzed systems. For the digestive system, the form of contamination occurs through bioaccumulation and biomagnification by the ingestion of contaminated food or water. In the case of the respiratory system, contamination occurs through the inhalation of MPs suspended in the atmospheric air. The different foraging characteristics of bats, the type of capture strategy for this food, and the type of habitat reinforce the idea that plastic contaminants are present in all environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Almost nothing is known about the communication calls of the Ussurian tube-nosed bat Murina ussuriensis. To determine social call types, we recorded various calls of M. ussuriensis under experimental conditions and then classified the social calls into different types: simple call, aggressive loud call, aggressive regular call (repeated), squawk call, and courtship call (repeated and complex). Simple calls in both sexes were FM sweep types, and they were used to respond to one another. Aggressive loud calls and aggressive regular calls were emitted by males. Bouts of two to five aggressive calls lasted 1–3 s. The number of aggressive regular calls per night increased when the distance between males was reduced. When dominance was established between males, aggressive loud calls or aggressive regular calls ceased. Squawk calls were emitted by the subordinate male when the dominant male approached. Courtship calls were emitted by both sexes. Courtship calls (repeated and complex) were emitted only by males, and bouts of two to nine courtship calls were 1–3 s long. Each of the calls contained two or three steep frequency-modulated syllables in quick succession, with a variety of calls emitted by each male. The number of courtship calls per bout increased when females were approached. The bats tended to use lower frequency signals for social calls with peak frequencies of approximately 21–34 kHz. This study provides the first report of the social calls of M. ussuriensis and demonstrates that this species uses a complex acoustic communication system.",

Previous observations of feathers found in feces led to the hypothesis that the birdlike noctule (Nyctalus aviator, Vespertilionidae) could prey on birds. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed fecal samples from six species (Barbastella pacifica, Murina hilgendorfi, Myotis frater, N. aviator, Plecotus sacrimontis, and Vespertilio sinensis) collected from central Hokkaido, Japan, via DNA barcoding. We identified the presence of the Middendorff’s grasshopper warbler (Locustella ochotensis) in the diet of a pregnant individual of N. aviator. All the other samples proved negative regarding bird prey DNA. This is the first time that the consumption of a bird by N. aviator is confirmed with molecular evidence. Our findings add invaluable insight into the diet of this bat and its potentially opportunistic foraging behavior.",

Fleshy fruits eaten by these vertebrates are widely distributed throughout angiosperm phylogeny. Similarly, a frugivorous diet has evolved independently many times in birds and mammals. Bird dispersal is more common than mammal-dispersal in all lineages of angiosperms, and we suggest that the evolution of bird fruits may have facilitated the evolution of frugivory in primates. The diets of fruit-eating bats overlap less with those of other kinds of frugivorous vertebrates. With a few exceptions, most families producing vertebrate-dispersed fruit appeared substantially earlier in earth history than families of their vertebrate consumers. It is likely that major radiations of these plants and animals have occurred in the past 30 Ma, in part driven by geological changes and also by the foraging behavior of frugivores in topographically complex landscapes. Overall, this mutualistic interaction has had many evolutionary and ecological consequences for tropical plants and animals for most of the Cenozoic Era. Loss of frugivores and their dispersal services will have a strong negative impact on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of tropical and subtropical communities.",

            "abstractNote": "Energy produced by wind farms has diverse positive environmental effects, but can also be related to negative impacts, including wildlife mortality through collisions with wind turbines. Bird and bat mortality caused by collisions with wind turbines can be estimated indirectly by counting carcasses within wind farms. However, carcass removal by scavengers often biases such measurements. In this study, we identiﬁed the main scavengers removing bird and bat carcasses in a tropical wind farm. A known fate analysis was done to assess the effect of carcass type (i.e., small bird, large bird, bat), vegetation type (i.e., secondary vegetation, croplands) and season (dry and rainy seasons of 2009) on carcass persistence rates. We identiﬁed three main scavenger groups, with mammals being the most abundant group. Our results show high rates of carcass removal relative to previous studies, especially for bats; there were fewer remaining carcasses after 20 days in our tropical site than in non-tropical environments reported elsewhere. We found a higher carcass persistence rate during the rainy season than in the dry season, possibly due to a greater abundance of food resources for scavenger organisms in the rainy season. Although we found some evidence for higher persistence rates for large bird carcasses than for small bird and bat carcasses during the rainy season, overall carcass type was not a strong predictor of persistence rates. Similarly, we did not ﬁnd a strong effect of vegetation type on carcass persistence rates. Results suggest that in order to estimate accurate bird and bat mortality in tropical wind farm areas, seasonality should be incorporated to correction factors of carcass removal rates.",

These networks develop the ecological processes that provide ecosystem services for human societies. Understanding the causes and consequences of changes in ecological networks due to landscape modification would allow us to understand the consequences of ecological processes. However, there is still few empirical data on the effects of network characteristics on the loss of natural environments. We investigated how bat–fruit networks respond to three landscapes representing the gradient of modification from pre-montane forest to a heterogeneous agricultural landscape in the Colombian Andes (continuous forests, forest fragments, and crops). We found that forest contained smaller bat–fruit networks than forest fragments and crops. Modified landscapes had similar ecological network structures to forest (nestedness and modularity), but crops contained less specialized networks compared to forests and fragments and the species role in these habitats were changed. The networks in the rural coffee landscape maintain their structure in the different transformation scenarios, indicating that seed dispersal services are maintained even in the most transformed scenarios. Although the number of species does not decrease due to transformations, species change their roles in the most transformed habitats. This result sheds light on the way that bat-fruit networks respond to anthropogenic transformations, showing higher stability than theoretically predicted.",

            "abstractNote": "The oil palm industry is one of the main economic drivers in Southeast Asia. The industry has caused tropical deforestation on a massive scale in producing countries, and this forest conversion to oil palm agriculture has decimated the habitat of numerous native species. Monoculture and polyculture practices are two distinctive oil palm production systems. We hypothesize that polyculture farming hosts a greater diversity of species than monoculture farming. Habitat complexity in smallholdings is inﬂuenced by multiple farming practices (i.e. polyculture and monoculture). However, little is known about the effects of such farming practices in smallholdings on mammalian biodiversity, and particularly frugivorous bats. Our study aimed to ﬁnd the best farming practice to reconcile oil palm production with biodiversity conservation. Mist-nets were used to trap frugivorous bats at 120 smallholdings in Peninsular Malaysia. We compared species richness and the abundance of frugivorous bats between monoculture and polyculture smallholdings. We investigated their relationships with vegetation structure characteristics. Our results revealed that species richness and abundance of frugivorous bats were signiﬁcantly greater in polyculture smallholdings than monoculture smallholdings. We also found that 28.21% of the variation in species richness was explained by in situ habitat characteristics, including the number of dead standing oil palms and immature oil palms, non-grass cover, height of non-grass cover, and farming practices. The in situ habitat quality was closely associated with oil palm farming management. Commercial growers should implement polyculture rather than monoculture farming because polyculture farming has positive effects on the abundance and species richness of bats in oil palm production landscapes.",
