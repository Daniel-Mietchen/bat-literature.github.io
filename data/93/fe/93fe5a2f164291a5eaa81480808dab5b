Geoffroy St.-Hilaire, 1805), and N. macrotis (Gray, 1840). Only N. macrotis and N. laticaudatus have been recorded from Argentina. We found that specimens of Nyctinomops captured in the province of Misiones, Argentina did not correspond to the characters of either species known from Argentina, and did not match characters of any other known species. Morphological, morphometric, and molecular analyses of these specimens revealed that they represent a new species, which we describe herein.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are speculated to have originated in bats. The mechanisms by which these viruses are maintained in individuals or populations of reservoir bats remain an enigma. Mathematical models have predicted long-term persistent infection with low levels of periodic shedding as a likely route for virus maintenance and spillover from bats. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells and MERS coronavirus (CoV) can co-exist\n              in vitro\n              . To test our hypothesis, we established a long-term coronavirus infection model of bat cells that are persistently infected with MERS-CoV. We infected cells from\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              with MERS-CoV and maintained them in culture for at least 126 days. We characterized the persistently infected cells by detecting virus particles, protein and transcripts. Basal levels of type I interferon in the long-term infected bat cells were higher, relative to uninfected cells, and disrupting the interferon response in persistently infected bat cells increased virus replication. By sequencing the whole genome of MERS-CoV from persistently infected bat cells, we identified that bat cells repeatedly selected for viral variants that contained mutations in the viral open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein. Furthermore, bat cells that were persistently infected with ΔORF5 MERS-CoV were resistant to superinfection by wildtype virus, likely due to reduced levels of the virus receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and higher basal levels of interferon in these cells. In summary, our study provides evidence for a model of coronavirus persistence in bats, along with the establishment of a unique persistently infected cell culture model to study MERS-CoV-bat interactions.",

We conducted a genetic survey of the federally endangered Florida bonneted bat (Eumops floridanus) sampled from its USA range in southern Florida. Florida bonneted bats are primarily found in four regions separated by approximately 100 to 250 km, including three western natural areas: Babcock Webb WMA (BW), Polk County (PC), and Collier County (CC) and one urban population on the east coast, Miami-Dade County (MD). We used 22 microsatellite loci and cytochrome b sequences to assess the extent of connectivity and levels of genetic diversity. Populations were highly differentiated at microsatellite loci (overall FST = 0.178) and model-based and ordination analyses showed that MD was the most distinct among pairwise comparisons. Regional populations were small (Ne < 100) with no evidence of inbreeding. Contemporary migration and historic gene flow suggested that regional populations have not frequently exchanged migrants, and thus the divergence among western regions was likely a result of genetic drift. Significantly, mitochondrial DNA revealed that haplotypes from MD were similar or shared with those recognized as Eumops ferox from Cuba and Jamaica, and divergent (1.5%) from the remainder of bonneted bats in Florida. Our data support the management of each of the four populations as distinct population segments, and that BW, PC and CC combined are on an independent evolutionary trajectory from bats in MD. Bonneted bats in Florida appear to harbor cryptic diversity that will require a reassessment of their taxonomy.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Molecular phylogenetics has provided unprecedented resolution in the ruminant evolutionary tree. However, molecular age estimates using only one or a few (often misapplied) fossil calibration points have produced a diversity of conflicting ages for important evolutionary events within this clade. I here identify 16 fossil calibration points of relevance to the phylogeny of Bovidae and Ruminantia and use these, individually and together, to construct a dated molecular phylogeny through a reanalysis of the full mitochondrial genome of over 100 ruminant species.\nResults: The new multi-calibrated tree provides ages that are younger overall than found in previous studies. Among these are young ages for the origin of crown Ruminantia (39.3–28.8 Ma), and crown Bovidae (17.3–15.1 Ma). These are argued to be reasonable hypotheses given that many basal fossils assigned to these taxa may in fact lie on the stem groups leading to the crown clades, thus inflating previous age estimates. Areas of conflict between molecular and fossil dates do persist, however, especially with regard to the base of the rapid Pecoran radiation and the sister relationship of Moschidae to Bovidae. Results of the single-calibrated analyses also show that a very wide range of molecular age estimates are obtainable using different calibration points, and that the choice of calibration point can influence the topology of the resulting tree. Compared to the single-calibrated trees, the multi-calibrated tree exhibits smaller variance in estimated ages and better reflects the fossil record.\nConclusions: The use of a large number of vetted fossil calibration points with soft bounds is promoted as a better approach than using just one or a few calibrations, or relying on internal-congruency metrics to discard good fossil data. This study also highlights the importance of considering morphological and ecological characteristics of clades when delimiting higher taxa. I also illustrate how phylogeographic and paleoenvironmental hypotheses inferred from a tree containing only extant taxa can be problematic without consideration of the fossil record. Incorporating the fossil record of Ruminantia is a necessary step for future analyses aiming to reconstruct the evolutionary history of this clade.",

            "abstractNote": "An issue arising from recent progress in establishing the placental mammal Tree of Life concerns the nomenclature of high-level clades. Fortunately, there are now several well-supported clades among extant mammals that require unambiguous, stable names. Although the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature does not apply above the Linnean rank of family, and while consensus on the adoption of competing systems of nomenclature does not yet exist, there is a clear, historical basis upon which to arbitrate among competing names for high-level mammalian clades. Here, we recommend application of the principles of priority and stability, as laid down by G.G. Simpson in 1945, to discriminate among proposed names for high-level taxa. We apply these principles to specific cases among placental mammals with broad relevance for taxonomy, and close with particular emphasis on the Afrotherian family Tenrecidae. We conclude that no matter how reconstructions of the Tree of Life change in years to come, systematists should apply new names reluctantly, deferring to those already published and maximizing consistency with existing nomenclature.",

Adult removal experiments on the terrestrial frog Hylophorbus rufescens and the undescribed arboreal frog Oreophryne sp. “A” demonstrate a significant positive effect of parental attendance on offspring survivorship and differential causes of egg mortality between microhabitats. Desiccation was the primary cause of egg mortality for the arboreal frog, whereas predation was the main source of mortality for the terrestrial frog. These selection pressures (desiccation and predation) are comparable to two of Wilson’s “prime movers” of the evolution of parental care (harsh environment and predation) and may have driven and/or are maintaining the evolution of parental care behaviors in these Papuan microhylid frogs. These results highlight microhabitat-specific selection pressures in the evolution and maintenance of parental care behaviors.",

Our search of literature showed that the author of the species name Rhinolophus hipposideros is André (1797); in the work Der Zoologe, oder Compendiöse Bibliothek des wissenswürdigsten aus der Thiergeschichte und allgemeinen Naturkunde published by 19 April 1797, André (1797: 65) used the name Noctilio Hipposideros and labelled it with“mihi”. André’s (1797) work takes priority over Deutsche Fauna oder kurzgefaßte Naturgeschichte der Thiere Deutschlands by Borkhausen (1797) to which the creation of the name Noctilio Hipposideros has been attributed; the publication date of the latter work for the purposes of zoological nomenclature is 30 September 1797. Revised dating is provided for the second volume of Bechstein’s translation of Pennant’s History of Quadrupeds to which the description of Rhinolophus hipposideros was also formerly assigned: Thomas Pennant’s allgemeine Uebersicht der vierfüßigen Thiere. It is shown to be published by 6 October 1799, although the book bears a title-page date 1800.",

            "abstractNote": "The apparent ability of bats to harbor many virulent viruses without showing disease is likely driven by distinct immune responses that coevolved with mammalian flight and the exceptional longevity of this order. Yet our understanding of the immune mechanisms of viral tolerance is restricted to a small number of bat–virus relationships and remains poor for coronaviruses (CoVs), despite their relevance to human health. Proteomics holds particular promise for illuminating the immune factors involved in bat responses to infection, because it can accommodate especially low sample volumes (e.g., sera) and thus can be applied to both large and small bat species as well as in longitudinal studies where lethal sampling is necessarily limited. Further, as the serum proteome includes proteins secreted from not only blood cells but also proximal organs, it provides a more general characterization of immune proteins. Here, we expand our recent work on the serum proteome of wild vampire bats (\n              Desmodus rotundus\n              ) to better understand CoV pathogenesis. Across 19 bats sampled in 2019 in northern Belize with available sera, we detected CoVs in oral or rectal swabs from four individuals (21.1% positivity). Phylogenetic analyses identified all RdRp gene sequences in vampire bats as novel α-CoVs most closely related to known human CoVs. Across 586 identified serum proteins, we found no strong differences in protein composition nor abundance between uninfected and infected bats. However, receiver operating characteristic curve analyses identified seven to 32 candidate biomarkers of CoV infection, including AHSG, C4A, F12, GPI, DSG2, GSTO1, and RNH1. Enrichment analyses using these protein classifiers identified downregulation of complement, regulation of proteolysis, immune effector processes, and humoral immunity in CoV-infected bats alongside upregulation of neutrophil immunity, overall granulocyte activation, myeloid cell responses, and glutathione processes. Such results denote a mostly cellular immune response of vampire bats to CoV infection and identify putative biomarkers that could provide new insights into CoV pathogenesis in wild and experimental populations. More broadly, applying a similar proteomic approach across diverse bat species and to distinct life history stages in target species could improve our understanding of the immune mechanisms by which wild bats tolerate viruses.",

Impaired immunity could be important for forecasting pathogen spillover, as many land‐use changes that generate mercury contamination also bring wildlife into close contact with humans and domestic animals. However, the interactions among contaminants, immunity and infection are difficult to study in natural systems, and empirical tests of possible directional relationships remain rare.\n                \n                \n                  We capitalized on extreme mercury variation in a diverse bat community in Belize to test association among contaminants, immunity and infection. By comparing a previous dataset of bats sampled in 2014 with new data from 2017, representing a period of rapid agricultural land conversion, we first confirmed bat species more reliant on aquatic prey had higher fur mercury. Bats in the agricultural habitat also had higher mercury in recent years. We then tested covariation between mercury and cellular immunity and determined if such relationships mediated associations between mercury and bacterial pathogens. As bat ecology can dictate exposure to mercury and pathogens, we also assessed species‐specific patterns in mercury–infection relationships.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Across the bat community, individuals with higher mercury had fewer neutrophils but not lymphocytes, suggesting stronger associations with innate immunity. However, the odds of infection for haemoplasmas and\n                    Bartonella\n                    spp. were generally lowest in bats with high mercury, and relationships between mercury and immunity did not mediate infection patterns. Mercury also showed species‐ and clade‐specific relationships with infection, being associated with especially low odds for haemoplasmas in\n                    Pteronotus mesoamericanus\n                    and\n                    Dermanura phaeotis\n                    . For\n                    Bartonella\n                    spp., mercury was associated with particularly low odds of infection in the genus\n                    Pteronotus\n                    but high odds in the subfamily Stenodermatinae.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and application\n                    . Lower general infection risk in bats with high mercury despite weaker innate defense suggests contaminant‐driven loss of pathogen habitat (i.e. anemia) or vector mortality as possible causes. Greater attention to these potential pathways could help disentangle relationships among contaminants, immunity and infection in anthropogenic habitats and help forecast disease risks. Our results also suggest that contaminants may increase infection risk in some taxa but not others, emphasizing the importance of considering surveillance and management at different phylogenetic scales.",

In this study, we examine relationships of P. mariannus across two island groups in the western Paciﬁc Ocean. Microsatellite data and mitochondrial sequences, from D-loop, cytochrome oxidase I, and cytochrome b, suggest that the population on the islands of Palau is genetically isolated from the populations in the Mariana Islands. Our data conﬁrm that the bats of Palau should be considered a separate conservation unit from the bats of the Mariana Islands, supporting the current subspecies separation of these two populations. Our results also suggest that there is gene ﬂow among islands within the Mariana archipelago and that the bats on these islands, currently classiﬁed as two subspecies, should be managed as a single conservation unit, although we refrain from suggesting taxonomic revisions until genetic and morphological data become available from geographically intermediate populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Accurate reconstructions of phylogeny are essential for studying the evolution of a clade, and morphological characters are necessarily used for the reconstruction of the relationships of fossil organisms. However, variation in their evolutionary modes (for example rate variation and character non-independence) not accounted for in analyses may be leading to unreliable phylogenies. A recent study suggested that phylogenetic analyses of mammals may be suffering from a dominance of dental characters, which were shown to have lower phylogenetic signal than osteological characters and produced phylogenies less congruent with molecularly-derived benchmarks. Here we build on this previous work by testing five additional morphological partitions for phylogenetic signal and examining what aspects of dental and other character evolution may be affecting this, by fitting models of discrete character evolution to phylogenies inferred and time calibrated using molecular data. Results indicate that the phylogenetic signal of discrete characters correlate most strongly with rates of evolution, with increased rates driving increased homoplasy. In a dataset covering all Mammalia, dental characters have higher rates of evolution than other partitions. They do not, however, fit a model of independent character evolution any worse than other regions. Primates and marsupials show different patterns to other mammal clades, with dental characters evolving at slower rates and being more heavily integrated (less independent). While the dominance of dental characters in analyses of mammals could be leading to inaccurate phylogenies, the issue is not unique to dental characters and the results are not consistent across datasets. Molecular benchmarks (being entirely independent of the character data) provide a framework for examining each dataset individually to assess the evolution of the characters used.",

Satellite telemetry was used on nine ﬂying-foxes of three species (Pteropus alecto n = 5, P. vampyrus n = 2, and P. neohibernicus n = 2) to determine the scale and pattern of their long-distance movements and their potential to transfer these viruses between countries in the region. The animals were captured and released from six different locations in Australia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and TimorLeste. Their movements were recorded for a median of 120 (range, 47–342) days with a median total distance travelled of 393 (range, 76–3011) km per individual. Pteropus alecto individuals were observed to move between Australia and Papua New Guinea (Western Province) on four occasions, between Papua New Guinea (Western Province) and Indonesia (Papua) on ten occasions, and to traverse Torres Strait on two occasions. Pteropus vampyrus was observed to move between Timor-Leste and Indonesia (West Timor) on one occasion. These ﬁndings expand upon the current literature on the potential for transfer of zoonotic viruses by ﬂying-foxes between countries and have implications for disease risk management and for the conservation management of ﬂying-fox populations in Australia, New Guinea, and the Lesser Sunda Islands.",

We present algorithms to automatically determine these distances as well as geometric correspondences. This approach is motivated by the aspiration of students of natural science to understand the continuity of form that unites the diversity of life. At present, scientists using physical traits to study evolutionary relationships among living and extinct animals analyze data extracted from carefully defined anatomical correspondence points (landmarks). Identifying and recording these landmarks is time consuming and can be done accurately only by trained morphologists. This necessity renders these studies inaccessible to nonmorphologists and causes phenomics to lag behind genomics in elucidating evolutionary patterns. Unlike other algorithms presented for morphological correspondences, our approach does not require any preliminary marking of special features or landmarks by the user. It also differs from other seminal work in computational geometry in that our algorithms are polynomial in nature and thus faster, making pairwise comparisons feasible for significantly larger numbers of digitized surfaces. We illustrate our approach using three datasets representing teeth and different bones of primates and humans, and show that it leads to highly accurate results.",

            "abstractNote": "Deforestation and the conversion of forests to agricultural areas lead to habitat loss and often create highly fragmented landscapes. Permeability and quality of the surrounding matrix determine the connectivity of re­ maining forest remnants. For mobile species, such as bats, the matrix is not necessarily an entirely in­ surmountable obstacle. We studied the effects of fragmentation on New-World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae), a highly diverse keystone taxon in the Neotropics. Bats were assessed in two highly fragmented systems varying in matrix quality: Forested islands surrounded by the water (I) and forest fragments embedded in a matrix of small-scale agriculture (A) together with a continuous forest as control (C). In total, we recorded over 2 years 5176 captures. Observed species richness was highest in continuous forest. Fragmentation reduced in both fragmented landscapes the bat diversity and led to characteristic changes in the bat assemblage, with gleaning animalivorous phyllostomids being most affected. The responses of bats to fragmentation were found to be not only guild - but also species-specific within the guild, a fact easily overlooked or misinterpreted when focussing solely on diversity indices or the response of bat guilds alone. Forest remnants can support a relatively speciose bat fauna, due to the heterogeneity of the inter-fragment matrix. On forested islands, however, isolation pro­ cesses lead to a decline in bat diversity, resulting in strongly impoverished bat assemblages favouring highly mobile species and habitat generalists. Conservation of the full local bat community of phyllostomids, including the vulnerable gleaning animalivorous phyllostomids, however, requires the protection of old-growth forests.",

            "abstractNote": "Rabies vaccination is a crucial part of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), but it tends to consist of long and costly regimens of intramuscular (IM) injections. Most human rabies deaths are caused by delayed access, unaffordability or ineffective delivery of PEP. Reducing these barriers is crucial to ensure that this incurable yet preventable disease does not cost lives. In 2022, WHO published new guidance towards the introduction or expansion of rabies vaccination into national immunization programmes to systematically drive down human rabies deaths effectively and cost-efficiently. Such guidance grounds on the latest scientific recommendation provided by WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts in 2018. WHO recommends a shortened 1-week rabies vaccination schedule, with visits on days 0, 3 and 7. On each visit, a 2-site intradermal (ID) injection (using only 0.1 ml of vaccine in each site) is administered. ID administration allows for vials to be shared among several patients within a 6-8 hours timeline. Compared to IM administration, ID is cost- and dose-sparing, even in low-throughput clinics. Additionally, this regimen requires only 3 visits to the healthcare facility, improving patient compliance. However, the uptake of this shortened ID regimen remains limited. It should now be a matter of urgency for Health Ministries in rabies-endemic settings to adopt the WHO-recommended shortened ID vaccination schedule and ensure appropriate medical training to improve PEP delivery. This will enable countries to improve PEP delivery and allow underserved populations to access affordable, life-saving rabies vaccines.",

Vertebrate prey most frequently eaten by C. auritus were murid rodents whereas V. spectrum consumed primarily passerine birds. The frequency of occurrence of food items did not differ signiﬁcantly with age or sex, at least for T. cirrhosus and C. auritus. Signiﬁcant seasonal variations in diet were observed only for C. auritus, which consumed more insects during the wet season. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm the importance of insects in the diet of T. cirrhosus and present new information on a diversiﬁed diet for V. spectrum and opportunistic feeding for C. auritus.",

This proposition ﬁrst envisioned by Forbes (1907) and then Diamond (1975) prompted the development of numerous modelling approaches (e.g. null model analysis, co-occurrence networks and, more recently, joint species distribution models). Both theory and experimental evidence support the idea that ecological interactions may affect co-occurrence, but it remains unclear to what extent the signal of interaction can be captured in observational data. It is now time to step back from the statistical developments and critically assess whether co-occurrence data are really a proxy for ecological interactions. In this paper, we present a series of arguments based on probability, sampling, food web and coexistence theories supporting that signiﬁcant spatial associations between species (or lack thereof) is a poor proxy for ecological interactions. We discuss appropriate interpretations of co-occurrence, along with potential avenues to extract as much information as possible from such data.",

Transmission mechanisms within bat populations remain enigmatic, precluding effective management of zoonotic infections. Vampire bats transmit rabies virus throughout Latin America, causing lethal human rabies and thousands of livestock deaths every year. By selecting among competing transmission models applied to spatially replicated, longitudinal field data, we find that most rabies virus exposures are nonlethal and instead immunize bats, thus facilitating viral persistence. Further, frequent interactions among bats from different colonies are necessary to maintain the chain of transmission. We also evaluate the efficacy of bat culling and demonstrate that it has minimal effects on seroprevalence when spatially coordinated control is absent.\n          , \n            Bats are important reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases, yet the mechanisms that allow highly virulent pathogens to persist within bat populations remain obscure. In Latin America, vampire-bat–transmitted rabies virus represents a key example of how such uncertainty can impede efforts to prevent cross-species transmission. Despite decades of agricultural and human health losses, control efforts have had limited success. To establish persistence mechanisms of vampire-bat–transmitted rabies virus in Latin America, we use data from a spatially replicated, longitudinal field study of vampire bats in Peru to parameterize a series of mechanistic transmission models. We find that single-colony persistence cannot occur. Instead, dispersal of bats between colonies, combined with a high frequency of immunizing nonlethal infections, is necessary to maintain rabies virus at levels consistent with field observations. Simulations show that the strong spatial component to transmission dynamics could explain the failure of bat culls to eliminate rabies and suggests that geographic coordination of control efforts might reduce transmission to humans and domestic animals. These findings offer spatial dynamics as a mechanism for rabies persistence in bats that might be important for the understanding and control of other bat-borne pathogens.",

            "abstractNote": "In bats, the wing membrane is anchored not only to the body and forelimb, but also to the hindlimb. This attachment configuration gives bats the potential to modulate wing shape by moving the hindlimb, such as by joint movement at the hip or knee. Such movements could modulate lift, drag, or the pitching moment. In this study we address: 1) how the ankle translates through space during the wingbeat cycle; 2) whether amplitude of ankle motion is dependent upon flight speed; 3) how tension in the wing membrane pulls the ankle; and 4) whether wing membrane tension is responsible for driving ankle motion. We flew five individuals of the lesser dog-faced fruit bat, Cynopterus brachyotis (Family: Pteropodidae), in a wind tunnel and documented kinematics of the forelimb, hip, ankle, and trailing edge of the wing membrane. Based on kinematic analysis of hindlimb and forelimb movements, we found that: 1) during downstroke, the ankle moved ventrally and during upstroke the ankle moved dorsally; 2) there was considerable variation in amplitude of ankle motion, but amplitude did not correlate significantly with flight speed; 3) during downstroke, tension generated by the wing membrane acted to pull the ankle dorsally, and during upstroke, the wing membrane pulled laterally when taut and dorsally when relatively slack; and 4) wing membrane tension generally opposed dorsoventral ankle motion. We conclude that during forward flight in C. brachyotis, wing membrane tension does not power hindlimb motion; instead, we propose that hindlimb movements arise from muscle activity and/or inertial effects.",

Although species that have a wide geographic distribution are frequently revealed to be polytypic, to date, no study has evaluated the taxonomic status of populations of Rhynchonycteris naso. Thus, the aim of this study is to address the patterns of phylogeographic structure and taxonomic subdivision of R. naso using molecular phylogenetics, morphometric data and ecological niche modeling. Phylogenetic results recovered using the genes COI, Cytb, Chd1, Dby, and Usp9x, supported the monophyly of the genus Rhynchonycteris, in addition, a deep phylogeographic structure was revealed by the mitochondrial gene COI for the populations of Belize and Panama in comparison to those of South America. The PCA, and the linear morphometry indicated an apparent differentiation between the cis-Andean and trans-Andean populations. Furthermore, according to the skull morphology, at least two morphotypes were identified. Ecological niche modeling projections in the present have shown that the Andean cordillera acts as a climatic barrier between these two populations, with the depression of Yaracuy (Northwest Venezuela) being the only putative climatically suitable path that could communicate these two populations. On the other hand, projections for the last glacial maximum showed a drastic decrease in climatically suitable areas for the species, suggesting that cycles of lower temperatures played an important role in the separation of these populations.",

This is especially problematic as they represent a substantial portion of undiscovered biodiversity, and have implications for not only species conservation, but even assaying potential risk of zoonotic spillover. Here, we use integrative approaches to delineate potential cryptic species in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophidae), evaluate the phenotypic disparities between cryptic species, and identify key traits for their identiﬁcation. We tested the use of multispecies coalescent models (MSC) using Bayesian Phylogenetic and Phylogeography (BPP) and found that BPP was useful in delineating potential cryptic species, and consistent with acoustic traits. Our results show that around 40% of Asian rhinolophid species are potentially cryptic and have not been formally described. In order to avoid potential misidentiﬁcation and allow species to be accurately identiﬁed, we identiﬁed quantitative noseleaf sella and acoustic characters as the most informative traits in delineating between potential cryptic species in Rhinolophidae. This highlights the physical differences between cryptic species that are apparent in noseleaf traits which often only qualitatively described but rarely measured. Each part of the noseleaf including the sella, lateral lappets, and lancet furrows, play roles in focusing acoustic beams and thus, provide useful characteristics to identify cryptic Rhinolophus species. Finally, species delimitation for cryptic species cannot rely on genetic data alone, but such data should be complemented by other evidence, including phenotypic, acoustic data, and geographic distributions to ensure accurate species identiﬁcation and delineation.",

Coronaviruses (CoV) have been detected in pteropodid bats from several Southeast Asian countries, but little is known about coronaviruses in the Indonesian archipelago in proportion to its mammalian biodiversity. In this study, we screened pooled faecal samples from the Indonesian colonies of Pteropus vampyrus with unbiased next-generation sequencing. Bat CoVs related to Rousettus leschenaultii CoV HKU9 and Eidolon helvum CoV were detected. The 121 faecal samples were further screened using a conventional hemi-nested pan-coronavirus PCR assay. Three positive samples were successfully sequenced, and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed the presence of alpha- and beta-coronaviruses. CoVs belonging to the subgenera Nobecovirus, Decacovirus and Pedacovirus were detected in a single P. vampyrus roost. This study expands current knowledge of coronavirus diversity in Indonesian flying foxes, highlighting the need for longitudinal surveillance of colonies as continuing urbanization and deforestation heighten the risk of spillover events.",

However, large-scale patterns in its evolution are largely unstudied. Here, we address several fundamental questions about the origins of acoustic communication in terrestrial vertebrates (tetrapods), using phylogenetic methods. We show that origins of acoustic communication are significantly associated with nocturnal activity. We find that acoustic communication does not increase diversification rates, a surprising result given the many speciation-focused studies of frog calls and bird songs. We also demonstrate that the presence of acoustic communication is strongly conserved over time. Finally, we find that acoustic communication evolved independently in most major tetrapod groups, often with remarkably ancient origins (~100–200 million years ago). Overall, we show that the role of ecology in shaping signal evolution applies to surprisingly deep timescales, whereas the role of signal evolution in diversification may not.",

Fundamentally lacking from this discussion is the ontogeny of how these two systems become functionally integrated producing an evolutionary developmental model. We build such a model by integrating growth and development of the cochlea, larynx, and sound production with the ontogeny of locomotion in newborn bats. In addition, we use available fossil and molecular data along with patterns of high frequency vocalization in extant mammals to model probable evolutionary transitions in bats. We find clear evidence that the ability to hear high frequency echolocation-like sounds preceded the ability to produce it and that a simple echolocation system was likely inherited from a shrew-like ancestor and was not an in situ evolutionary innovation of bats. Refinement of this system coevolved with sustained flight, both ontogenetically and evolutionarily, leading to the sophisticated echolocation observed today.",

            "abstractNote": "While sound is a signal modality widely used by many animals, it is very susceptible to attenuation, hampering effective long-distance communication. A strategy to minimize sound attenuation that has been historically used by humans is to use acoustic horns; to date, no other animal is known to use a similar structure to increase sound intensity. Here, we describe how the use of a roosting structure that resembles an acoustic horn (the tapered tubes that form when new leaves of plants such as\n              Heliconia\n              or\n              Calathea\n              species start to unfurl) increases sound amplification of the incoming and outgoing social calls used by Spix's disc-winged bat (\n              Thyroptera tricolor\n              ) to locate roosts and group members. Our results indicate that incoming calls are significantly amplified as a result of sound waves being increasingly compressed as they move into the narrow end of the leaf. Outgoing calls were faintly amplified, probably as a result of increased sound directionality. Both types of call, however, experienced significant sound distortion, which might explain the patterns of signal recognition previously observed in behavioural experiments. Our study provides the first evidence of the potential role that a roost can play in facilitating acoustic communication in bats.",

This survey of their placentation shows there is great variation even within families. As an example three subfamilies of tenrec have been examined. The interhemal region is cellular hemomonochorial in Echinops and Microgale but endotheliochorial in Micropotamogale. Golden moles, which are placed in the same order, have hemodichorial placentation. Many insectivores have complex arrangements for histotrophic nutrition involving columnar trophoblast cells. These range from areolae in moles through complexly folded hemophagous regions in tenrecs to the trophoblastic annulus in shrews. Of these placental characters, few offer support to current phylogenies. However, the case for placing hedgehogs and gymnures in a separate order (Erinaceomorpha) is bolstered by the presence of interstitial implantation, amniogenesis by cavitation, a hemochorial barrier and a prominent spongy zone; these features do not occur in shrews, moles or solenodons (Soricomorpha). Three insectivoran grade mammals deserve close attention as they have been selected for genome sequencing. One of these, the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), has not been studied with current methodology and renewed investigation of this or the closely related genus Atelerix should be a priority.",

            "abstractNote": "Anoura Gray, 1838 are Neotropical nectarivorous bats and the most speciose genus within the phyllostomid subfamily Glossophaginae. However, Anoura species limits remain debated, and phylogenetic relationships remain poorly known, because previous studies used limited Anoura taxon sampling or focused primarily on higher-level relationships. Here, we conduct the first phylogenomic study of Anoura by analyzing 2039 genomewide ultraconserved elements (UCEs) sequenced for 42 individuals from 8 Anoura species/lineages plus two outgroups. Overall, our results based on UCEs resolved relationships in the genus and supported (1) the monophyly of small-bodied Anoura species (previously genus Lonchoglossa); (2) monotypic status of A. caudifer; and (3) nested positions of “A. carishina”, A. caudifer aequatoris, and A. geoffroyi peruana specimens within A. latidens, A. caudifer and A. geoffroyi, respectively (suggesting that these taxa are not distinct species). Addi­ tionally, (4) phylogenetic networks allowing reticulate edges did not explain gene tree discordance better than the species tree (without introgression), indicating that a coalescent model accounting for discordance solely through incomplete lineage sorting fit our data well. Sensitivity analyses indicated that our species tree results were not adversely affected by varying taxon sampling across loci. Tree calibration and Bayesian coalescent analyses dated the onset of diversification within Anoura to around ~ 6–9 million years ago in the Miocene, with extant species diverging mainly within the past ~ 4 million years. We inferred a historical biogeographical scenario for Anoura of parapatric speciation fragmenting the range of a wide-ranging ancestral lineage centered in the Central to Northern Andes, along with Pliocene–Pleistocene dispersal or founder event speciation in Amazonia and the Brazilian Atlantic forest during the last ~ 2.5 million years.",

Unassociated postcranial fragments of the humerus and femur also represent a vespertilionoid, but appear to reflect a different, unidentified species. The new taxon, Quinetia frigidaria sp. nov., is referred to the genus Quinetia, previously known only from approximately contemporaneous deposits in Europe. The new species is larger than Quinetia misonnei from the early Oligocene of Belgium. It is similar in some morphological characters to Chadronycteris rabenae (Chiroptera incertae sedis) of the late Eocene (Chadronian) of northwestern Nebraska and to Stehlinia species (?Palaeochiropterygidae) from the Eocene and Oligocene of Europe, but differs from each in morphological details of the dentition and maxilla. An unassociated talonid of a lower molar from Fitterer Ranch shows myotodont morphology, unlike the nyctalodont lower molars in Q. misonnei, and thus represents a second chiropteran taxon in the fauna. Quinetia frigidaria is a member of a Paleogene radiation of bats near the low point of the Eocene-early Oligocene decline in global temperatures, increased seasonal aridity, and loss of tropical floras from midlatitude North America.",

            "abstractNote": "The mammalian nasal fossa contains a set of delicate and often structurally complex bones called turbinals. Turbinals and associated mucosae function in regulating respiratory heat and water loss, increasing surface area for olfactory tissue, and directing airflow within the nasal fossa. We used high-resolution micro-CT scanning to investigate a unique maxilloturbinal morphology in 37 species from the bat family Rhinolophidae, which we compared with those of families Hipposideridae, Megadermatidae, and Pteropodidae. Rhinolophids exhibit numerous structural modifications along the nasopharyngeal tract associated with emission of high duty cycle echolocation calls via the nostrils. In rhinolophids, we found that the maxilloturbinals and a portion of ethmoturbinal I form a pair of strand-like bony structures on each side of the nasal chamber. These structures project anteriorly from the transverse lamina and complete a hairpin turn to project posteriorly down the nasopharyngeal duct, and vary in length among species. The strand-like maxilloturbinals in Rhinolophidae were not observed in our outgroups and represent a synapomorphy for this family, and are unique in form among mammals. Within Rhinolophidae, maxilloturbinal size and cross-sectional shape were correlated with phylogeny. We hypothesize that strand-shaped maxilloturbinals may function to reduce respiratory heat and water loss without greatly impacting echolocation call transmission since they provide increased mucosal surface area for heat and moisture exchange but occupy minimal space. Alternatively, they may play a role in transmission of echolocation calls since they are located directly along the path sound travels between the larynx and nostrils during call emission.

            "abstractNote": "The novel β-coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, may pose a threat to North American bat populations if bats are exposed to the virus through interaction with humans, if the virus can subsequently infect bats and be transmitted among them, and if the virus causes morbidity or mortality in bats. Further, if SARS-CoV-2 became established in bat populations, it could possibly serve as a source for new infection in humans, domesticated animals, or other wild animals. Wildlife management agencies in the United States are concerned about these potential risks and have begun to issue guidance regarding work that brings humans into contact with bats, but decision making is difficult because of the high degree of uncertainty about many of the relevant processes that could lead to virus transmission and establishment. The risk assessment described in this report was undertaken to provide management agencies with an understanding of the likelihood that the various steps in the causal pathways would lead to SARS-CoV-2 infection of North American bats from people. This assessment focused on the active season for bats in the temperate zone of North America (April 15 through November 15), and used Myotis lucifugus (little brown bats) as a surrogate species. At the time of this work (April 2020), no empirical data about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on North American bats were available, so a formal process of expert judgment was used to elicit estimates of the underlying parameters. Twelve experts in bat ecology, epidemiology, virology, and wildlife disease from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia participated in the elicitation. A Monte Carlo simulation model was used to integrate the parameter estimates elicited from the experts and to predict the likelihood of exposure and infection in bats through a series of transmission pathways, with particular attention to capturing uncertainty in the predictions.\n\nGiven the current state of knowledge as expressed by the expert panel, the results of this assessment indicate that there is a non-negligible risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to bats. For example, if a research scientist were shedding SARS-CoV-2 virus while handling bats under the field protocols used in North America prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk model indicates that 50 percent (uncertainty, 15–84 percent) of those bats could be exposed to virus, and 17 percent (uncertainty, 3–51 percent) could become infected. Use of personal protective equipment, especially a respirator, is expected to reduce the exposure risk. The expert panel estimated that exposure risk from research scientists could be reduced 94–96 percent (uncertainty, 86–99 percent) through proper use of appropriate N95 respirators (a type of mechanical filter worn over the nose and mouth), dedicated clothing (such as Tyvek coveralls), and gloves. Should any North American bats become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the expert panel estimated that there is an approximately 33-percent chance the virus could spread within a bat population.\n\nThis study, conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, identified several critical uncertainties that could affect the estimate of risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 entering bat populations—notably, the underlying probability that a human would be shedding virus while working with bats, the likelihood of the virus replicating in bat tissue, and the likelihood of transmission of the virus within bat populations. Ongoing empirical work during May–October 2020 may shed light on these issues. Follow-up work is needed to better understand the probability of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to bats from the general public; the manner in which the probabilities of exposure, infection, and transmission would differ during hibernation compared to the breeding season; and the likelihood of important effects, like morbidity and mortality in bats, the possibility of zoonosis from a North American bat reservoir, and effects of and on other wildlife.",

            "abstractNote": "Kelba quadeemae\n              , a fossil mammal from the Early Miocene of East Africa, was originally named on the basis of three isolated upper molars.\n              Kelba\n              has previously been interpreted as a creodont, a pantolestid, an insectivoran, and a hemigaline viverrid. The true affinities of this taxon have remained unclear because of the limited material and its unique morphology relative to other Miocene African mammals. New material of\n              Kelba\n              from several East African Miocene localities, most notably a skull from the Early Miocene locality of Songhor in Western Kenya, permits analysis of the affinities of\n              Kelba\n              and documents the lower dentition of this taxon. Morphological comparison of this new material clearly demonstrates that\n              Kelba\n              is a member of the order Ptolemaiida, a poorly understood group whose fossil record was previously restricted to the Oligocene Fayum deposits of northern Egypt. Phylogenetic analysis supports the monophyly of the Ptolemaiida, including\n              Kelba\n              , and recovers two monophyletic clades within the order. We provide new family names for these groups and an emended diagnosis for the order. The discovery of ptolemaiidans from the Miocene of East Africa is significant because it extends the known temporal range of the order by >10 million years and the geographic range by >3,200 km. Although the higher-level affinities of the Ptolemaiida remain obscure, their unique morphology and distribution through a larger area of Africa (and exclusively Africa) lend support to the idea that Ptolemaiida may have an ancient African origin.",

            "abstractNote": "Significance\n            Melanin is a widespread pigment that provides black to reddish brown hues to organisms. Recent evidence has shown that melanin is retained in exceptionally preserved fossils, including feathered dinosaurs, allowing the reconstruction of ancient color patterns. However, little is known about the chemical preservation of melanin or its distribution in the fossil record. Here, we show that melanin is preserved in a number of soft-bodied fossils, but its burial under high pressure and temperature for millions of years alters its original chemistry. The widespread occurrence of melanin substantiates the applicability of reconstructing aspects of original color patterns and allows us to dismiss the alternative suggestion that these structures are microbial in origin.\n          , \n            In living organisms, color patterns, behavior, and ecology are closely linked. Thus, detection of fossil pigments may permit inferences about important aspects of ancient animal ecology and evolution. Melanin-bearing melanosomes were suggested to preserve as organic residues in exceptionally preserved fossils, retaining distinct morphology that is associated with aspects of original color patterns. Nevertheless, these oblong and spherical structures have also been identified as fossilized bacteria. To date, chemical studies have not directly considered the effects of diagenesis on melanin preservation, and how this may influence its identification. Here we use time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry to identify and chemically characterize melanin in a diverse sample of previously unstudied extant and fossil taxa, including fossils with notably different diagenetic histories and geologic ages. We document signatures consistent with melanin preservation in fossils ranging from feathers, to mammals, to amphibians. Using principal component analyses, we characterize putative mixtures of eumelanin and phaeomelanin in both fossil and extant samples. Surprisingly, both extant and fossil amphibians generally exhibit melanosomes with a mixed eumelanin/phaeomelanin composition rather than pure eumelanin, as assumed previously. We argue that experimental maturation of modern melanin samples replicates diagenetic chemical alteration of melanin observed in fossils. This refutes the hypothesis that such fossil microbodies could be bacteria, and demonstrates that melanin is widely responsible for the organic soft tissue outlines in vertebrates found at exceptional fossil localities, thus allowing for the reconstruction of certain aspects of original pigment patterns.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Molecular techniques are increasingly employed to recognize the presence of cryptic species, even among commonly observed taxa. Previous studies have demonstrated that bats using high-duty cycle echolocation may be more likely to speciate quickly. Pteronotus parnellii is a widespread Neotropical bat and the only New World species to use high-duty cycle echolocation, a trait otherwise restricted to Old World taxa. Here we analyze morphological and acoustic variation and genetic divergence at the mitochondrial COI gene, the 7th intron region of the y-linked Dby gene and the nuclear recombination-activating gene 2, and provide extensive evidence that P. parnellii is actually a cryptic species complex.\nResults: Central American populations form a single species while three additional species exist in northern South America: one in Venezuela, Trinidad and western Guyana and two occupying sympatric ranges in Guyana and Suriname. Reproductive isolation appears nearly complete (only one potential hybrid individual found). The complex likely arose within the last ~6 million years with all taxa diverging quickly within the last ~1-2 million years, following a pattern consistent with the geological history of Central and northern South America. Significant variation in cranial measures and forearm length exists between three of the four groups, although no individual morphological character can discriminate these in the field. Acoustic analysis reveals small differences (5–10 kHz) in echolocation calls between allopatric cryptic taxa that are unlikely to provide access to different prey resources but are consistent with divergence by drift in allopatric species or through selection for social recognition.\nConclusions: This unique approach, considering morphological, acoustic and multi-locus genetic information inherited maternally, paternally and bi-parentally, provides strong support to conclusions about the cessation of gene flow and degree of reproductive isolation of these cryptic species.",

            "abstractNote": "Phyllostomidae (New World leaf-nosed bats), the second most speciose chiropteran family, is one of the best-known and wellstudied chiropteran groups. Due to the ecological and morphological diversity of this family, comparative studies of phyllostomids abound in the literature, and numerous systematic and phylogenetic analyses have been published. Unfortunately, many of these studies have reached different conclusions concerning phyllostomid relationships, and have proposed different classification schemes. This has led to confusion, and highlighted the need for a well-supported and stable classification of the family, particularly at the level of subfamilies and tribes, areas of the greatest controversy. The goal of this paper is to provide morphological diagnoses of higher-level taxa (subtribes, tribes, and subfamilies). Herein we provide morphological diagnoses for 11 subfamilies (Macrotinae, Micronycterinae, Desmodontinae, Lonchorhininae, Phyllostominae, Glyphonycterinae, Glossophaginae, Lonchophyllinae, Carollinae, Rhinophyllinae, and Stenodermatinae), 12 tribes (Desmodontini, Diphyllini, Macrophyllini, Phyllostomini, Vampyrini, Choeronycterini, Glossophagini, Brachyphyllini, Lonchophyllini, Hsunycterini, Sturnirini, and Stenodermatini), and nine subtribes (Anourina, Choeronycterina, Brachyphyllina, Phyllonycterina, Vampyressina, Enchisthenina, Ectophyllina, Artibeina, and Stenodermatina).",

            "abstractNote": "Pteronotus davyi, Davy’s naked-backed bat, is a tropical bat whose current distribution in Mexico covers the watersheds of the Pacific and the Gulf coasts of Mexico, converges at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and continues into the Yucatan peninsula. We evaluated phylogeographic relationships among 18 populations in Mexico using data from the nucleotide sequence of the hypervariable II domain of the mitochondrial DNA control region from 105 specimens. Extant populations were distributed over 3 geographic regions (Pacific Coast, Gulf Coast, and Southeastern) that were delineated a priori according to floristic characteristics and biogeography. Coalescent simulations supported a phylogeographic model of 2 refugia situated in the south of Mexico (Arc and Soconusco refuges) during the late Pleistocene, followed by expansion into Pacific Coast, Gulf Coast, and Southeastern groups. The populations of the Southeast were genetically divergent from the Pacific and Gulf Coast populations, supporting the existence of 2 distinct lineages of P. davyi in Mexico, likely due to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec acting as a geographical barrier. Examination of our data revealed genetic differentiation of the Pacific and Gulf coastal groups but at a lower level relative to the Southeast. This pattern suggests that the Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, and Sierra Madre del Sur act as physical barriers to dispersal for P. davyi. DOI: 10.1644/08-MAMM-A-212R3.1.",

            "abstractNote": "Throughout evolution the foraging and echolocation behaviors as well as the motor systems of bats have been adapted to the tasks they have to perform while searching and acquiring food. When bats exploit the same class of environmental resources in a similar way, they perform comparable tasks and thus share similar adaptations independent of their phylogeny. Species with similar adaptations are assigned to guilds or functional groups. Habitat type and foraging mode mainly determine the foraging tasks and thus the adaptations of bats. Therefore, we use habitat type and foraging mode to deﬁne seven guilds. The habitat types open, edge and narrow space are deﬁned according to the bats’ echolocation behavior in relation to the distance between bat and background or food item and background. Bats foraging in the aerial, trawling, ﬂutter detecting, or active gleaning mode use only echolocation to acquire their food. When foraging in the passive gleaning mode bats do not use echolocation but rely on sensory cues from the food item to ﬁnd it. Bat communities often comprise large numbers of species with a high diversity in foraging areas, foraging modes, and diets. The assignment of species living under similar constraints into guilds identiﬁes patterns of community structure and helps to understand the factors that underlie the organization of highly diverse bat communities. Bat species from different guilds do not compete for food as they differ in their foraging behavior and in the environmental resources they use. However, sympatric living species belonging to the same guild often exploit the same class of resources. To avoid competition they should differ in their niche dimensions. The ﬁne grain structure of bat communities below the rather coarse classiﬁcation into guilds is determined by mechanisms that result in niche partitioning.",

Since 2007, seven new Malagasy Miniopterus species have been described compared to only two new species since 1936 from the Afrotropics. The conservative morphology of Miniopterus and limited geographic sampling in continental Africa have undoubtedly contributed to the deficit of continental species. In addition to uncertainty over species limits, phylogenetic relationships of Miniopterus remain mostly unresolved, particularly at deeper backbone nodes. Previous phylogenetic studies were based on limited taxon sampling and/ or limited genetic sampling involving no more than five loci. Here, we conduct the first phylogenomic study of the Afrotropical Miniopteridae by analyzing up to 3772 genome-wide ultraconserved elements (UCEs) from historic and modern samples of 70 individuals from 25 Miniopterus species/lineages. We analyze multiple datasets of varying degrees of completeness (70, 90, and 100 percent complete) using partitioned concatenated maximum likelihood and multispecies coalescent methods. Our well-supported, species-level phylogenies resolved most (6/8 or 7/8) backbone nodes and strongly support for the first time the monophyly of the Malagasy radiation. We inferred the crown age of African Miniopteridae in the late Miocene (10.4 Ma), while the main lineages of Miniopterus appear to have contemporaneously diversified in two sister radiations in the Afrotropics and Madagascar. Species-level divergence of 23 of 25 African + Malagasy Miniopterus were estimated to have 95 % HPDs that overlap with the late Miocene (5.3–10.4 Ma). We present ancestral range estimates that unam­ biguously support a continental African radiation that originated in the Zambezian and Somalian/Ethiopian biogeographic regions, but we cannot rule out back colonization of Africa from Madagascar. The phylogeny indicates genetic support for up to seven new species.",

Recently, bats have been used increasingly as model organisms for such studies because of their large number of species, high diversity of life-history strategies, and a comparatively detailed knowledge of their neuroanatomy. Here, we draw attention to inherent problems of comparative brain size studies, highlighting limitations but also suggesting alternative approaches. We argue that the complexity and diversity of neurological tasks that the brain and its functional regions (subdivisions) must solve cannot be explained by a single or few variables representing selective pressures. Using an example we show that by adding a single relevant variable, morphological adaptation to foraging strategy, to a previous analysis a correlation between brain and testes mass disappears completely and changes entirely the interpretation of the study. Future studies should not only look for novel determinants of brain size but also include known correlates in order to add to our current knowledge. \\Ve believe that comparisons at more detailed anatomical, taxonomic, and geographical levels will continue to contribute to our understanding of the function and evolution of mammalian brains.",

By exploring the demography of Milne‐Edwards' sifakas (\n              Propithecus diadema edwardsi\n              ), and comparing it to other well‐studied primates, we explore the effect of demographic and life‐history factors on social structure. Specifically, we compare lemur survivorship and fertility patterns to two published composite models: one created for New World and another created for Old World monkeys. Using longitudinal data collected on individual\n              Propithecus diadema edwardsi\n              from four study groups from 1986–2000 in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar, we quantify 1) group composition, 2) birth seasonality, 3) interbirth interval, 4) life‐table values, and 5) population growth estimates. The mortality, survivorship, and life‐expectancy schedules indicate high infant and juvenile mortality. Fertility remains high until death. The intrinsic rate of increase and net reproductive rate indicate a shrinking population. We suggest that high mortality rather than low fertility causes the observed population decline. While sifaka survivorship closely resembles New World patterns, fertility resembles Old World patterns, i.e., like New World monkeys, few sifakas survive to reproductive age, and those that do, reproduce at a slow rate resembling the Old World pattern. This necessarily impacts social structure. An adult sifaka at the end of her lifespan will have one only daughter who survives to reproductive age, compared to 3.4 for New World or 2.7 for Old World monkeys. Demography limits the formation of large kin‐based groups for sifakas, and survivorship and fertility patterns do not easily permit sifakas to form large same‐sex family groups.

            "abstractNote": "Species with specific roosting, foraging or breeding requirements are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and degradation. For bats, the availability and environmental condition of caves can be a limiting factor. The cave specialist Natalus macrourus (formerly Natalus espiritosantensis) is categorized as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List but as Vulnerable in Brazil, based on a projected population reduction and a decline in its area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat. There is a lack of knowledge about the species’ distribution, natural history and ecology, information that is required for conservation. Using new occurrence data and potential distribution modelling we evaluated the distribution of N. macrourus in Brazil, analysed pressures on and threats to the species, and assessed the species’ conservation needs. Natalus macrourus is positively associated with areas with higher probability of cave occurrence and negatively associated with areas of high variation in mean daily temperature and mean annual rainfall. Areas with high environmental suitability for N. macrourus correspond to only % of the potential distribution modelled. We estimate that the species has already lost % of its natural habitat and that there is , % of habitat remaining in areas with high environmental suitability. We calculated that approximately half of the caves in areas with high environmental suitability are ,  km from mining operations and only % of the species’ potential distribution lies within protected areas. Given the strong association of N. macrourus with caves, it is important to protect these habitats, and we recommend that caves where the species is present should receive immediate protection.",

Bats appear effectively to dominate the aerial nocturnal adaptive zones of fruit and insect eating, although they are more effective as small rather than as large insectivores. In most tropical locations, either owls or bats are regular consumers of fish; bats which feed on terrestrial vertebrates and the bird families Podargidae, Aegothelidae, and Nyctibiidae seem to occupy the adaptive zone of small owls, but these bats and birds are limited anatomically from replacing larger owls. Bat hawks (Falco rufigularis and Macheiramphus alcinus) and some carnivorous bats may be the only regular aerial predators of bats. The use that many bats make of night roosts as locations for food consumption, and the nocturnal roosting habits of some diurnal birds may represent adaptations for avoid. ing nocturnal, volant predators.",

There was marked seasonal variation in the prey taken, with bats and frogs dominating the biomass at different times. In November 1987, all-night radio-tracking over 15 bat nights revealed significant differences in habitat use between individuals, with one bat foraging along and over the Zambezi River, and another foraging in Acacia albida woodland and over the river. The bats alternated between foraging from continuous flight and making short flights from perches, although foraging over the river usually entailed continuous flight. Significant differences in the use of these foraging strategies between 1987 and an earlier study coincided with differences in November rainfall, and a drastic reduction in the amount of food the bats consumed daily.",

            "abstractNote": "Micronycteris is divided into four subgenera, Micronycteris, Leuconycteris, Xenoctenes, and Schizonycteris. The latter includes Micronycteris (Schizonycteris) minuta, Micronycteris (S.) schmidtorum, Micronycteris (S.) sanborni and Micronycteris (S.) yatesi. Little is known of the biology of M. (S.) sanborni, which is widely distributed in the dry forests of South America, but is known from only few sites. The scarcity of records of M. sanborni appears to be at least partly related to the difficulty of differentiating this species from the other members of the subgenus Schizonycteris. The present study identifies the key traits that distinguish this species from other Schizonycteris, reviews the geographic distribution of the species, and presents some notes on breeding patterns. Six new localities are presented for M. sanborni, and are analyzed together with those available in the literature, providing new insights into ecological and zoogeographic patterns. A number of the diagnostic features established by Simmons (1996) in the description of M. sanborni proved to have little taxo‑nomic value, especially for the differentiation of M. minuta and M. yatesi, which it closely resembles. The primary external difference is the pure white color of the ventral pelage and the proportion of the white base (2/3‑4/5) of the dorsal hair in M. sanborni, in contrast with dirty white or pale gray and a much shorter white base of the dorsal hair in the other species. A number of cranial traits are also important. The distributional data now indicate that M. sanborni occurs mainly in mesic and open areas, including disturbed habitats, in the Caatinga scrublands and the Cerrado savannas of northeastern Brazil, especially in areas with rocky outcrops. Micronycteris sanborni appears to be monoestrous, with births coincid‑ing with the rainy season.",

Although this new record does not extend the distribution of the species, it confirms its presence in Honduras and highlights the relevance of the protected area housing the species. With the current record of C. centralis, there are now 112 confirmed bat species for Honduras.",

            "abstractNote": "At the beginning of the century of extinctions, science has only inventoried a very small proportion of the living species of the globe. In order to face the taxonomic urgency that results from this taxonomic gap combined with the biodiversity crisis, zootaxonomy needs efficient, rigorous and automatic nomenclatural Rules, that allow to spend a minimal time on nomenclatural problems—rather than investing time, energy and money in renaming millions of already named taxa in order to follow alternative nomenclatural systems, e.g., “phylogenetic” ones, that furthermore do not show theoretical superiority to the current Linnaean-Stricklandian one. The current Code, result of a 250-year improvement process, is based on very sound and healthy Rules, being theory-free regarding taxonomy, relying on objective allocation of nomina to taxa by a system of ostension using onomatophores, and on an objective basic Principle, priority, for recognizing the valid nomen of a taxon in case of synonymy or homonymy. Nevertheless, this nomenclatural system is certainly not perfect. It should be modified at least in nine directions: (1) it should adopt a technical terminology avoiding possible misinterpretations from outsiders of the field and even from specialists, and allowing a precise formalisation of its mode of functioning; (2) its plan should be drastically modified; (3) its Principles should be redefined, and some added; (4) material evidence for the allocation of nomina to taxa through specimens deposited in permanent collections should be given more weight; (5) it should incorporate all nomina of higher taxa, providing clear and strict universal Rules for their naming, whereas conserving the traditional nomina largely used in non-specialized systematic literature; (6) it should allow for the recognition of many more ranks at lower nomenclatural levels, i.e., just above genus, between genus and species, and below species; (7) it should provide much more stringent Rules for the protection against priority of “wellknown” nomina or sozonyms; (8) various “details” should be addressed, various Rules and Recommendations changed before a new edition of the Code is published; (9) the procedure of implementations of changes in the Code should be modified in order to involve zootaxonomists of the whole world in the decisions. In several instances, the Rules of the Code should become much more compulsory for all zoologists, editors and publishers, to avoid the publication of endless and sometimes most detrimental discussions among taxonomists which give a poor image of nomenclature and taxonomy among the biological sciences, such as bitter discussions about the “best” nomen to be used under a so-called “usage” philosophy, or about nomina to be applied to higher taxa. Code-compliance in zootaxonomic publications should be highlighted, and editors and publishers should require from authors who follow alternative nomenclatural Rules (or no rule at all) to make it clear by using particular modes of writing their nomina. It is argued here that if the Code of the 21st century does not evolve to incorporate these changes, it will prove unable to play its role in front of several important recent theoretical and practical developments of taxonomy and run the risk of being abandoned by a part of the international community of zootaxonomists. The latter could then adopt alternative “phylogenetic” nomenclatural Rules, despite the severe practical problems and theoretical flaws posed by such projects. This would be most detrimental for all comparative biological disciplines including systematics, and even for the unity of biology. In the course of this discussion, a few recommendations are given concerning the standards and guidelines suggested by recent authors for a good, modern, integrative taxonomy.",

            "abstractNote": "In recent articles published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, Mark Springer and John Gatesy (S&G) present numerous criticisms of recent implementations and testing of the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model in phylogenomics, popularly known as ‘‘species tree” methods. After pointing out errors in alignments and gene tree rooting in recent phylogenomic data sets, particularly in Song et al. (2012) on mammals and Xi et al. (2014) on plants, they suggest that these errors seriously compromise the conclusions of these studies. Additionally, S&G enumerate numerous perceived violated assumptions and deﬁciencies in the application of the MSC model in phylogenomics, such as its assumption of neutrality and in particular the use of transcriptomes, which are deemed inappropriate for the MSC because the constituent exons often subtend large regions of chromosomes within which recombination is substantial. We acknowledge these previously reported errors in recent phylogenomic data sets, but disapprove of S&G’s excessively combative and taunting tone. We show that these errors, as well as two nucleotide sorting methods used in the analysis of Amborella, have little impact on the conclusions of those papers. Moreover, several concepts introduced by S&G and an appeal to ‘‘ﬁrst principles” of phylogenetics in an attempt to discredit MSC models are invalid and reveal numerous misunderstandings of the MSC. Contrary to the claims of S&G we show that recent computer simulations used to test the robustness of MSC models are not circular and do not unfairly favor MSC models over concatenation. In fact, although both concatenation and MSC models clearly perform well in regions of tree space with long branches and little incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), simulations reveal the erratic behavior of concatenation when subjected to data subsampling and its tendency to produce spuriously conﬁdent yet conﬂicting results in regions of parameter space where MSC models still perform well. S&G’s claims that MSC models explain little or none (0–15%) of the observed gene tree heterogeneity observed in a mammal data set and that MSC models assume ILS as the only source of gene tree variation are ﬂawed. Overall many of their criticisms of MSC models are invalidated when concatenation is appropriately viewed as a special case of the MSC, which in turn is a special case of emerging network models in phylogenomics. We reiterate that there is enormous promise and value in recent implementations and tests of the MSC and look forward to its increased use and reﬁnement in phylogenomics.",

Th is hypothesis found considerable support and eventually it may even turn out to be true, but at present it still needs more testing. It is only clear so far that the steppe whiskered bats from the western Eurasia and steppe whiskered bats from southern China are different, phylogenetically quite distant species. Th e study of variation and between-group differences of the steppe whiskered bats in morphological characters and molecular markers throughout the species geographic range is needed, and especially the comparison of their molecular genetic traits with those of M. davidii from the type locality (Beijing). Until such an analysis is done, taxonomic statements on the synonymy of the names M. aurascens and M. davidii are premature.",

The combination of the biodiversity crisis and the taxonomic gap results in taxonomic urgency. In this context, great attention should be paid to the nomenclatural rules helping taxonomists in their urgent task, rather than diverting their time and energy to secondary questions or debates. In zoology, the new criterion of ‘prevailing usage’, introduced in the 1999 edition of the Code of nomenclature to ‘protect’ some nomina, raises four kinds of problems: (1) it weakens the binding value and strength of the Code, thus indirectly bringing support to the development of alternative nomenclatural systems; (2) it encourages personal debates among taxonomists, giving undue importance to the ‘argument of authority’ in nomenclatural decisions; (3) it sends a wrong message to non-taxonomists as regards completion of the taxonomic work; (4) it acts as a threat against natural history museums, in devaluing onomatophores (type specimens), the conservation of which is one of their major ‘visible’ functions. In conclusion, it is suggested that ‘protection’ of some nomina ‘threatened’ by rules of the Code should be limited strictly to nomina well-known outside the small world of systematics. This would require new rules for the Code to clearly define categories of usage on the basis of objective criteria.",

The content of the samples, collected in October and November of 1995 and in September and October of 1996 and 1997, consisted mainly of bird feathers identi®ed as those of the robin Erithacus rubecula and the blue tit Parus caeruleus. The presence of feathers during the 3 consecutive years of the study period con®rms that the diet of the greater noctule in this area is not based exclusively on arthropods as was previously suggested.",

This poses a conservation concern in Asian karst areas which support high bat species diversity, yet are experiencing habitat loss and degradation and increasing pressure from tourism and extractive industries. As disturbance during crucial reproductive periods (late pregnancy, lactation and weaning) threatens reproductive success, we investigated the reproductive phenology of a bat assemblage at two karst sites in North Vietnam. Our results indicate that the timing of major reproductive events coincides among two cave-dwelling pteropodids, and among 26 cave and foliage dwelling rhinolophids, hipposiderids and vespertilionids. March–July is the primary reproductive period for all insectivorous species sampled, and protection of maternity roosts during this time is critical. Reproduction in cave-dwelling pteropodids spanned a greater period (March–December), due to two birth periods each year. Lactation in the three insectivorous families studied was positively correlated with rainfall and temperature, with weaning occurring during the peak wet season. The strong congruence in reproductive phenologies in our results and climatic homogeneity of North Vietnam (18–23°N) suggests that our study may have wider applicability within the region. Vietnamese caves support high bat diversity which is likely threatened by harvesting for consumption and tourism development nationwide. Studies to investigate and address these threats should be given high priority.",

We aimed to assess the dispersal and distribution of mtDNA lineages of G. soricina and evaluate the possible effect of vicariant events in the population history and dynamics. Glossophaga soricina presented two main highly supported mtDNA lineages, which diverged between »2.4 and 5 million years ago, probably following a vicariant event caused by the Andes ﬁnal uplift. The lower sea level during Pleistocene glaciations also made possible the occupation of Jamaica after an event of dispersion over the Caribbean Sea, although past climatic ﬂuctuations had little effect over population dynamics of G. soricina. Our results corroborate the idea that the Andes uplift played an important role in the evolution of Neotropical biodiversity. In this context we suggest that geographic events causing large scale environmental disjunction, such as the uplift of mountains, are more likely to restrict gene ﬂow amongst populations of tolerant species with broad geographic range than local climate driven environmental changes.",

Paracone and metacone have moved from a dilambdodont position in the middle of the tooth to the labial side of the tooth where they form the labial cutting edge. Along with the well-developed and close ﬁtting labial cutting edges of the premolars and canines, this cutting edge skirts nearly the entire perimeter of the palate. The labial rim of the lower teeth ﬁt inside the labial rim of the upper teeth like two cookie cutters nesting one inside the other. Frugivores have a greater allocation of tooth area at the anterior end of the toothrow, while animalivorous species have more at the posterior end of the toothrow. The area occupied by canines of predators of struggling prey is greater than that for bats that eat non-struggling prey like fruit. In addition, frugivores have wider palates than long while many carnivores have longer palates than wide. Omnivores appear to have a more equal allocation of space to more kinds of teeth, particularly the incisors and non-molariform premolars, on the toothrow than do frugivores or animalivores. The mechanical nature of different food items is discussed and the suggestion made that describing foods in terms of their texture may be more important in tooth design than whether they are fruit or insect or vertebrate.",

Skull proportions and tooth morphology are examined and interpreted functionally. Four wide- faced bats from four families are convergent in having wide skulls, large masseter muscle volumes and stout jaws, indicating a powerful bite. Three of the four also have long canine teeth relative to their maxillary toothrows. Carnivorous bats have more elongate skulls, larger brain volumes and larger pinnae. The wide-faced bats are all oral emitters and have heads positively tilted relative to the basicranial axis. The carnivorous species are nasalemitting bats and have negatively tilted heads. The orientation of the head relative to the basicranial axis affects several characters of the skull and jaws and is not correlated with size. The speculation that the type of echolocation may be more of a determinant of evolutionary change than the feeding mechanism is addressed. Wide-faced bats are thought to be capable of eating hard prey items (durophagus) and are probably non- discriminating, aurally less sophisticated insect generalists while the carnivorous and non-durophagus insectivorous bats may be more discriminating and aurally more sophisticated in what they eat.",

Murina cyclotis is the most widespread in the region, although DNA barcodes of specimens currently identified as M. cyclotis suggest high genetic diversity within southeast Asia with the possibility that the form found in Indochina is not the same as that from the type locality on the Indian subcontinent. We recognize M. peninsularis from peninsular Malaysia and Borneo as distinct from M. cyclotis. Murina huttoni is known from only one locality in Laos but has been reported from scattered localities elsewhere in southeast Asia including Vietnam and Thailand. Specimens previously reported as M. tubinaris from southeast Asia, including Laos, were recently recognized as a distinct species, M. cineracea; however, we suggest M. feae is the appropriate name for this species, based on examination of the holotype from Myanmar. Specimens formerly reported as M. aurata from Laos are now referred to the recently described M. eleryi from Vietnam. A specimen from northern Laos matches the description of M. harrisoni in morphology, while genetically it matches M. tiensa. Comparisons with additional material from Vietnam, as well as DNA from both type specimens, suggest that M. tiensa is a junior synonym of M. harrisoni. We also report M. harrisoni from Thailand and Myanmar, based on specimens originally published as M. leucogaster. The latter species is not otherwise known to occur in Thailand or Myanmar and should be removed from those countries’ lists. The recently described M. walstoni is here reported for the first time from Laos. Two additional species from Laos do not match any currently described species, and are here described as new; both are also reported from Vietnam and one from Cambodia.",

            "abstractNote": "The aim of this paper is to evaluate the taxonomic diversity of fossil and extant bats from the region of the Serra da Mesa in the State of Goias, Central Brazil. Quaternary fossils were obtained from four limestone caves, namely Igrejinha, Carneiro, Nossa Senhora Aparecida, and Itambé. Information on extant bat fauna used for comparison were obtained from literature and from the collection of Museu Nacional (Rio de Janeiro). The taxonomic identification of the fragments was based on a comparative study of the masticatory apparatus of extant and fossil bat species. A total of 430 fragments were identified, comprising 27 species: Anoura geoffroyi, Artibeus sp., Carollia sp., Chrotopterus auritus, Desmodus rotundus, Desmodus sp., Emballonuridae sp. indet., Eptesicus/ Histiotus, Glossophaga sp., Lionycteris spurrelli, Lonchorhina aurita, Micronycteris megalotis, Mimon bennetti, Mimon crenulatum, Molossidae sp. indet., Myotis sp., Natalus stramineus, Phylloderma sp. n., Phyllostomus discolor, Phyllostomus hastatus, Platyrrhinus sp., Pteronotus davyi, Pteronotus parnelli, Sturnira sp., Tonatia sp. n., Lophostoma silvicola, and Trachops cirrhosus. Phyllostomidae was the most speciose family, but surprisingly most of the fossil fragments were attributed to the families Natalidae and Mormoopidae. Both of which are rare in the area today. The population reduction of these hot-humid-cave dwelling species (Natalus and Pteronotus) may suggest the climate of the area was warmer and wetter during some interval of the Late Pleistocene or Early Holocene. This study presents the first record of the genera Lionycteris, Lonchorhina and Trachops from the Quaternary of South America. The diversity of Chiroptera found in Serra da Mesa is equivalent to that described for Bahia, which heretofore has the most abundant record for Quaternary bats from South America.",

The most recent morphological review of Micronycteris recognizes 9 species, including 4 dark-bellied species (hirsuta, matses, megalotis, microtis), and 5 pale-bellied species (brosseti, homezi, minuta, sanborni, schmidtorum). Specimens of Micronycteris from Ecuador are poorly represented in museum collections, and some important areas within the country have few voucher specimens. Only 3 species (hirsuta, megalotis, and minuta) have been recorded in Ecuador. We collected a small series (N = 10) of dark-bellied specimens of Micronycteris during the Sowell Expedition 2001 to northwest Ecuador. In this paper we assess the morphological and molecular interspecific variation within the genus, comparing our series to other Micronycteris found in Ecuador and other Latin American countries. In Ecuador we distinguish 3 morphotypes among darkbellied forms. With one exception, our specimens except are referable either to M. megalotis or M. hirsuta. The one exception is unlike any other recognized species of Micronycteris. We provide a set of characters useful to distinguish dark-bellied species of Micronycteris in Ecuador and describe a new species.",

Two of at least four bat-specific variants of rabies virus in Canada have killed humans. Rabies is usually transmitted by biting, but bats are small mammals so their bites may go unnoticed. People exposed to rabid animals should receive postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). With 60 known human deaths from 1950 to 2009, rabies is rare in Canada and the United States of America compared with India where it kills over 100 people annually. In Asia and Africa, most human rabies is acquired from dog bites. In Brazil, dog and bat bites together account for >80% of human rabies. In Canada, rabies is a disease primarily confined to wildlife (foxes, racoons, skunks, and bats). The public image of bats is negatively affected by their association with diseases. Too often bats are victimized by allegations of their role in deadly diseases such as rabies, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In general, bats are not dangerous, but humans should seek treatment if they are bitten by one. (Graphical abstract shows a 4-g elegant myotis biting MBF’s finger—photo by Sherri and Brock Fenton.)",

However, all earlier methods assume a given model of population size changes (such as sudden expansion), parameters of which (e.g., time and amplitude of expansion) are fitted to the observed distributions of nucleotide differences among pairwise comparisons of all DNA sequences in the sample. Our theory indicates that for any time-dependent population size, N(␶) (in which time ␶ is counted backward from present), a time-dependent coalescence process yields the distribution, p(␶), of the time of coalescence between two DNA sequences randomly drawn from the population. Prediction of p(␶) and N(␶) requires the use of a reverse Laplace transform known to be unstable. Nevertheless, simulated data obtained from three models of monotone population change (stepwise, exponential, and logistic) indicate that the pattern of a past population size change leaves its signature on the pattern of DNA polymorphism. Application of the theory to the published mtDNA sequences indicates that the current mtDNA sequence variation is not inconsistent with a logistic growth of the human population.",

These data hold immense but unrealized promise for science and society, including use in biogeographic research addressing issues such as zoonotic diseases, invasive species, threatened species and habitats, and climate change. Ongoing and envisioned changes in biodiversity informatics involving data providers, aggregators, and users should catalyze improvements to allow efficient use of such data for diverse analyses. We discuss relevant issues from the perspective of modeling species distributions, currently the most common use of Primary Biodiversity Data. Key cross-cutting principles for progress include harnessing feedback from users and increasing incentives for improving data quality. Critical challenges include: (1) establishing individual and collective stable unique identifiers across all of biodiversity science, (2) highlighting issues regarding data quality and representativeness, and (3) improving feedback mechanisms. Such changes should lead to ever-better data and increased utility and impact, including greater data integration with various research areas within and beyond biogeography (e.g., population demography, biotic interactions, physiology, and genetics). Building on existing pilot functionalities, biodiversity informatics could see transformative changes over the coming decade via a combination of community consensus building, coordinated efforts to justify and secure funding, and technical innovations.",

            "abstractNote": "Older studies have claimed that bats including the Megachiroptera (fruit bats or flying foxes) have pure-rod retinas and possess no cone photoreceptors. We have determined the presence and the population densities of spectral cone types in six megachiropteran species belonging to four genera: <i>Pteropus rufus</i>, <i>P. niger</i>,<i> P. rodricensis</i>, <i>Rousettus madagascariensis</i>, <i>Eidolon dupreanum</i>, and <i>Epomophorus gambianus</i>. Spectral cone types and rods were assessed immunocytochemically with opsin-specific antibodies. All six species have rod-dominated retinas but possess significant cone populations. The high rod densities (range 350,000–800,000/mm<sup>2</sup>, depending on species and retinal location) provide good scotopic sensitivity in these predominantly nocturnal animals. With the cones (density range 1,300–11,000/mm<sup>2</sup>, corresponding to 0.25–0.6% of the photoreceptors, depending on species and retinal location) the retinas also possess the prerequisite for vision at photopic light levels. The three <i>Pteropus</i> species have two spectral cone types, a majority of middle-to-long-wave sensitive (L-) cones, and a minority of short-wave sensitive (S-) cones, indicating the potential for dichromatic color vision. This conforms to the pattern found in most mammals. In contrast, <i>Rousettus</i>, <i>Eidolon</i> and <i>Epomophorus</i> have L-cones but completely lack S-cones, indicating cone monochromacy and color blindness. The discussion relates these findings to the visual behavior of fruit bats.",

To identify genetic changes associated with the development of bat-specific traits, we performed whole-genome sequencing and comparative analyses of two distantly related species, fruit bat Pteropus alecto and insectivorous bat Myotis davidii. We discovered an unexpected concentration of positively selected genes in the DNA damage checkpoint and nuclear factor κB pathways that may be related to the origin of flight, as well as expansion and contraction of important gene families. Comparison of bat genomes with other mammalian species has provided new insights into bat biology and evolution.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are recognized reservoirs for many emerging zoonotic viruses of public health importance. Identifying and cataloguing the viruses of bats is a logical approach to evaluate the range of potential zoonoses of bat origin. We characterized the fecal pathogen microbiome of both insectivorous and frugivorous bats, incorporating 281 individual bats comprising 20 common species, which were sampled in three locations of Yunnan province, by combining reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and next-generation sequencing. Seven individual bats were paramyxovirus-positive by RT-PCR using degenerate primers, and these paramyxoviruses were mainly classified into three genera (Rubulavirus, Henipavirus and Jeilongvirus). Various additional novel pathogens were detected in the paramyxovirus-positive bats using Illumina sequencing. A total of 7066 assembled contigs (≥200 bp) were constructed, and 105 contigs matched eukaryotic viruses (of them 103 belong to 2 vertebrate virus families, 1 insect virus, and 1 mycovirus), 17 were parasites, and 4913 were homologous to prokaryotic microorganisms. Among the 103 vertebrate viral contigs, 79 displayed low identity (<70%) to known viruses including human viruses at the amino acid level, suggesting that these belong to novel and genetically divergent viruses. Overall, the most frequently identified viruses, particularly in bats from the family Hipposideridae, were retroviruses. The present study expands our understanding of the bat virome in species commonly found in Yunnan, China, and provides insight into the overall diversity of viruses that may be capable of directly or indirectly crossing over into humans.",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: The order Picornavirales represents a diverse group of positive-stranded RNA viruses with small non-enveloped icosahedral virions. Recently, bats have been identified as an important reservoir of several highly pathogenic human viruses. Since many members of the Picornaviridae family cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals, this study aimed to characterize members of the order Picornavirales in fruit bat populations located in the Southwest region of Cameroon. These bat populations are frequently in close contact with humans due to hunting, selling and eating practices, which provides ample opportunity for interspecies transmissions.\nRESULTS: Fecal samples from 87 fruit bats (Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus), were combined into 25 pools and analyzed using viral metagenomics. In total, Picornavirales reads were found in 19 pools, and (near) complete genomes of 11 picorna-like viruses were obtained from 7 of these pools. The picorna-like viruses possessed varied genomic organizations (monocistronic or dicistronic), and arrangements of gene cassettes. Some of the viruses belonged to established families, including the Picornaviridae, whereas others clustered distantly from known viruses and most likely represent novel genera and families. Phylogenetic and nucleotide composition analyses suggested that mammals were the likely host species of bat sapelovirus, bat kunsagivirus and bat crohivirus, whereas the remaining viruses (named bat iflavirus, bat posalivirus, bat fisalivirus, bat cripavirus, bat felisavirus, bat dicibavirus and bat badiciviruses 1 and 2) were most likely diet-derived.\nCONCLUSION: The existence of a vast genetic variability of picorna-like viruses in fruit bats may increase the probability of spillover infections to humans especially when humans and bats have direct contact as the case in this study site. However, further screening for these viruses in humans will fully indicate their zoonotic potential.",

            "abstractNote": "Sapoviruses (SaVs) belong to the Sapovirus genus, in the family Caliciviridae. They have been associated with gastroenteritis in humans and in pigs but not in other animals. In addition, some strains from pigs, chimpanzees and rodents show close sequence identity with human SaVs thereby suggesting the possibility of interspecies transmissions. Bats are known to be a major reservoir of zoonotic viruses, however, very little is known about the genetic diversity of SaVs in bats. To explore the genetic diversity of bat SaVs, fecal samples of Eidolon helvum and Epomophorus gambianus were treated according to the NetoVIR protocol and sequenced by Illumina technology. Nearly complete genome sequences of six highly divergent SaVs and one partial SaV (only VP1 region) were identified in Eidolon helvum and based on sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis, they potentially represent two novel genogroups, only distantly related to known SaVs. Furthermore, comparing these sequences with currently used screening primers and probes indicated that the novel SaVs would not be detected in routine epidemiological screening studies in humans in case an interspecies transmission would occur. Therefore, we designed and validated new primers that can detect both human and bat SaVs. In this study, we identified multiple novel bat SaVs, however, further epidemiological studies in humans are needed to unravel their potential role in gastroenteritis.",
