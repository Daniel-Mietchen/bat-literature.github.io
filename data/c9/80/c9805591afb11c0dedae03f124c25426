A core team of three, including graduate students and volunteers, will work in three phases to complete initial survey and summer counts and then analysing data to ascertain regional and seasonal distribution patterns. Close collaboration with the Turkish Society for Preservation of Wildlife (DHKD) will help raise public awareness and formulate a conservation plan.",

In the Bwindi region of Uganda, a hot spot of mammalian biodiversity in Africa, human livelihoods are intimately connected with wildlife, creating potential for exposure to filoviruses.\nMethods.  We tested samples from 331 febrile patients presenting to healthcare facilities near Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Western blot, using recombinant glycoprotein antigens for Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), and Marburg virus. Behavioral data on contact with wildlife were collected to examine risk factors for filovirus seropositivity.\nResults.  All patients were negative for active filovirus infection, by PCR analysis. However, patients were seroreactive to SUDV (4.7%), EBOV (5.3%), and BDBV (8.9%), indicating previous exposure. Touching duikers was the most significant risk factor associated with EBOV seropositivity, while hunting primates and touching and/or eating cane rats were significant risk factors for SUDV seropositivity.\nConclusions.  People in southwestern Uganda have suspected previous exposure to filoviruses, particularly those with a history of wildlife contact. Circulation of filoviruses in wild animals and subsequent spillover into humans could be more common than previously reported.",

This paper presents a review of published records and voucher specimens in museum collections. We reviewed 39 references and identified 116 records concerning nine species belonging to five families. Fifteen of these records mention 71 specimens of six species in collections. Distribution maps of known locations are provided for each species. Most records (70%) date back more than 10 years and two species have not been recorded for more than 40 years. Based on the bat fauna of Oman, a more thoroughly investigated neighbouring country, the presence of at least nine other, still unrecorded, species is expected. The status of bats in UAE and their conservation concerns are discussed. We encourage further field studies of the bat fauna of UAE.",

            "abstractNote": "In large regions of the Pacific Northwest of the United States, harvest of forests has converted old-growth coniferous forests into a mosaic of young patches «90 years old) of differing size and age. We examined the consequences of these changes on the roosting habits of the silver-haired bat, Lasionycteris noctivagans, which preferentially uses older forests in other parts of its range in the Pacific Northwest. Bats were captured using mist nets and harp traps at streams, ponds, and road sites in 1992 and 1993. L. noctivagans was captured only over water. Fifteen of 30 L. noctivagans captured were equipped with radiotransmitters. A total of 15 roost sites used by 13 individuals was found. All roosts were <3.5 km from the initial capture site and were in dead or dying trees with exfoliating bark, extensive vertical cracks, or cavities. Fourteen roosts were in trees with diameter at breast height >30 cm. Height of roost trees ranged from 6.9 to 61.5 m, and estimated height of roosts of bats ranged from 6.1 to 15.2 m. Roost trees were significantly taller than neighboring trees, which may facilitate the location of roosts by bats. Analysis of a 15-m radius plot around each roost tree revealed that roost sites had significantly less closure of overstory canopy, less understory, and shorter understory vegetation than comparable random plots. Reduced overstory canopy and understory vegetation provide a less-cluttered environment for flight of bats, which may be particularly important for newly volant young. Recruitment and retention of snags and the maintenance of structural complexity in forest patches in upland as well as riparian areas are important for the conservation of species of bats in managed forests.",

Adult monkeys of both sexes were the primary participants in nest-raiding. At Santa Rosa, the original captor of the pup tended to eat the entire carcass, whereas at Lomas Barbudal, the monkeys rapidly became satiated and allowed another monkey to have the carcass. At Lomas Barbudal, there was a tendency for adult females to share preferentially with their own offspring, but only if the offspring were less than 1 year old. Dominance rank of the owner of the carcass relative to the rank of the beggar did not significantly affect the probability of willingly transferring meat to the beggar. In one of two years, carcass theft was more likely to occur when the thief was higher ranking than the carcass owner.",

No information was available on the importance of bird nests as breeding sites and only one species, the Chocolate Wattled Bat Chalinolobus morio, has been recorded hibernating in a nest. Bird nests in Australia provide roosting habitat for four threatened bats and may be important to the conservation of these species.",

The ﬁrst analysis of habitat selection by R. mehelyi is provided, and the hypothesis explored that despite their close relatedness, in sympatry the two bat species showed different habitat preferences. For both species, the least preferred habitats were open habitats such as scrubland, grassland and arable land. As found elsewhere, R. euryale preferred broadleaved woodland. In addition, R. mehelyi also foraged in habitats characterized by loose trees, such as the ‘dehesa’, a semi-natural oak savanna. The progressive disappearance of the dehesa, jeopardized by land-use change, may not harm R. euryale, but could represent a threat to R. mehelyi, which would then be restricted to dense woodland, possibly competing with other bat species, including R. euryale. To conserve both species, the maintenance of a variety of wooded habitats of differing density is recommended.",

A total of 45 individuals of N. geoffroyi and 27 C. gouldii were ®tted with radio-transmitters, resulting in the location of 139 and 89 roosts, respectively. Male N. geoffroyi roosted in trees, fallen and decayed timber and arti®cial structures. These roosts were low to the ground, mainly under bark and in cracks in timber. Roosts of female N. geoffroyi were located higher above ground, and all within trees. Maternity roosts were predominantly located in large dead trees, approximately twice the diameter of roost trees used by females outside the breeding season. No maternity roosts were found under bark, despite half the roosts used by non-breeding females being located in these situations. Both sexes roosted primarily in dead timber and used cavities where the narrowest dimension of the entrance was 2.5 cm. Most roosts of C. gouldii were in dead spouts on large, live river red gum Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees. Intraspeci®c differences in roost characteristics were less pronounced for this species. Despite access to the same roosting opportunities, there were marked differences in roost selection between N. geoffroyi and C. gouldii. Both species favoured large diameter trees, but differed signi®cantly for all other measured variables: type of roost structure, condition of roost tree (live or dead), height of roost tree, height of roost, and entrance dimensions. Although these species are among the most widespread bats in Australia and are often considered to be habitat `generalists', both displayed a high level of discrimination in the roosts used. Clearly, roosting requirements are a complex and important issue in the conservation of even the most common species of bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Fifty radio-tagged long-tailed bats Chalinolobus tuberculatus, belonging to three social groups numbering on average 72±132 bats each, ranged over an area of 11 700 ha in Nothofagus rainforest in the Eglinton Valley, Fiordland, New Zealand, during the austral summers of 1993±96. Bats were followed for 12.7  6.3 (s d) days. Home-range sizes were among the largest published for Microchiroptera. Median minimum convex polygons (100% MCPs) for adult males were 1589 ha (max = 5629 ha), 1361 ha for post-lactating females, and 657 ha for non-reproductive females. Ranges of lactating females (median = 330 ha), were signi®cantly smaller. Juveniles that were volant for < 2 weeks had the smallest ranges (median = 237 ha) but movements increased signi®cantly after c. 2 weeks to a median of 2006 ha. Movements were frequent and rapid within the range (790  471 s d m/15 min) and average range lengths were 3.3±10.9 km (max = 19 km). Despite their large home ranges, bats concentrated their activity (85% of ®xes) in small core areas that represented a mean of 5.7  1.5% (s d) of the 100% MCPs. Ranges of roosting sites were also small, averaging 9.4  1.8% (s d) of total range size. Bats followed similar movement patterns each night but core areas only overlapped by 43  14% (s d) from one night to the next. Moderately low levels of overlap of home ranges (31±68%) and of core areas (23±56%) among individuals of the same reproductive class suggest a degree of spatial segregation among bats from the same roosting group. A prediction that C. tuberculatus has large ranges to minimize overlap between foraging bats, re¯ecting scarcity of food, requires testing. Range sizes were probably underestimates of seasonal, annual, and life-time range requirements. Nevertheless, large range size and the degree of individual spacing implies that conservation areas designed for bats should be large and that protection of roosting areas alone would not be suf®cient to protect bat populations.",

Roosts were located primarily using radiotelemetry; although others were found by light tagging, visual location and nest searching techniques. In the main study site in the Richmond Range a total of 54 K. papuensis diurnal roosts were located, 96.5% occurring in the suspended nests of the yellowthroated scrubwren Sericornis citreogularis (Pardalotidae) (93%) and the brown gerygone Gerygone mouki (Pardalotidae) (3.5%). At Mt Baldy, K. papuensis displayed greater variation in day roost selection, although 73% were in S. citreogularis nests. In both sites, day roosts were con®ned to the lower stratum of rainforest with a small proportion in eucalypt tall open forest with a rainforest subcanopy. Diurnal roosts were located at distances varying from 20 to 1200 m to the nearest major vegetation ecotone, ranging from along watercourses upslope to ridgelines. Diurnal roosts were predominantly occupied by single bats, with a maximum group size of eight individuals. All roosts in hanging nests were modi®ed by the presence of a basal hole. Strong circumstantial evidence was provided that K. papuensis modi®ed these roost structures in a manner allied to tent-making bats. A single maternity roost was located in the hollow of a rainforest canopy tree, Flindersia australis (Rutaceae).",

We radio-tracked 73 bats during spring±autumn of 1993 ±1997 to 155 day roosts, all of which were in trees. One hundred and forty-nine roosts were in cavities: 84 in live trunks, 33 in dead trunks, 32 in large branches (seven in dead branches, 25 in live); and the remaining six (occupied by solitary bats) were beneath loose bark. We compared characteristics of the 84 roost cavities in live trunks with 57 random available cavities also in live trunks. Cavities used by C. tuberculatus were not a random subset of available cavities. In comparison to available cavities, bat roosts were all located in knot hole cavities, were high from the ground, and had little surrounding vegetation. All roosts were dry inside. Bats used a higher proportion of cavities which had medium sized entrances and internal cavities, and thicker cavity walls. A logistic regression model incorporating nine cavity variables classi®ed roost and available cavities correctly 97% and 91% of the time, respectively. Distance to the nearest vegetation, cavity condition (wet or dry inside), height from the ground, and to a lesser extent internal cavity height, explained signi®cant proportions of the variation between roost and available cavities. Bats changed roost sites virtually every day and it appeared that suitable cavities were abundant in the unlogged forests of the study area. It is unlikely that modi®ed forests and forests managed for timber production contain such a large pool of potential roosting cavities.",

The size of the range may have increased further if more individuals had been tracked, as three of the four colonies studied had not reached their asymptotes. The total home‐range area covered by four serotine colonies was 127.36 km\n              2\n              . Excluding non‐breeding bats, a density of one bat per 120 ha was estimated. However, actual density was likely to be higher if there were additional non‐breeding females and immatures that were not in nursery roosts. Colonial home ranges and core areas overlapped, with individuals from different colonies feeding at the same sites. Individual home ranges (\n              n\n              = 32) varied from 0.16 to 47.58 km\n              2\n              , but these were not used exclusively by one individual. Around the colonial core area and breeding roosts, home ranges were used by all individuals from a single colony. It is only further from the core area that ranges appeared to be used by individuals. The distance from roost to feeding areas varied by up to 7.4 km, but the bat usually commuted along lines of trees and hedges and over pastures. This resulted in greater distances being travelled than if they had flown by a direct route. On average, individuals commuted distances of 8 km each night between feeding areas, with a maximum distance of over 41 km. They visited between 0 and 10 feeding sites each night (mean = 2.89).",

These cavities (stem tents) in which the bats roost are usually about one metre deep and 30 cm in diameter. We observed groups of bats roosting in fully‐formed stem tents during the daytime, and the construction and subsequent occupancy of newly formed tent cavities. Stem tents are similar in principle to leaf tents except, instead of being formed when bats chew veins and the surrounding tissues of leaves, stem tents are formed in\n              C. urens\n              when bats completely cut several of the central flower/fruit strings. Flower/fruit strings are mostly severed when they are in an immature stage, at times when they are thin and widely spaced. Once these strings thicken and become heavily‐laden with mature fruits, bats cannot penetrate the cluster to sever them. Our observations suggest that a single male enters an immature flower or fruit cluster either from below or the sides and severs the central strings along the peduncle. In early phases of stem‐tent construction,\n              C. sphinx\n              severs flower/fruit strings at a rate of about one or two per day, and cluster alteration may continue upwards to two months. Only one immature flower/fruit cluster on a\n              C. urens\n              tree is available for alteration by bats at any given time. That this bat does not roost in the fruit/flower cluster during the day, when a tent is under construction, and the accumulation of chewed flower and fruit strings beneath such a cluster in the morning, suggests that tent construction by\n              C. sphinx\n              is a night‐time activity.",

This tendon locking mechanism is of importance as it enables bats to reduce the energetic cost of hanging from branches.

Although all these species occur in the southern savanna biotic zone of Africa, each varies in its ability to exploit the African rainforest, arid and desert biotic zones. The kidneys of the Megachiroptera were very different to those of the insect‐eating Microchiroptera, and these differences were related to the need of fruit‐bats to excrete the surplus water associated with their diet. The urine concentrating capacity of each species of Microchiroptera was predicted from the IM/C ratio. Family characteristics were examined, and the urine concentrating capacities of the Malawian bats were compared with bats from elsewhere, and with some rodents. The insect‐ eating Microchiroptera exemplified a very diverse range of IM/C ratios. The IM/C ratio of each species was compared with its drinking behaviour in captivity, diet, foraging strategy, flight, aspect ratio, domicile, roosting behaviour and habitat. It was hypothesized that the ability of insect‐eating Microchiroptera to conserve urinary water would be an advantage to species: (a) living in xeric habitats; (b) adapted for sustained high‐speed flight; (c) roosting in hot dry domiciles; (d) roosting in solitude; and (e) living at high altitudes where seasonal low temperatures induce torpidity. These hypotheses were tested, and it was concluded that, while the ability to conserve urinary water may have been an advantage in most of these situations, it was not essential.",

This study, undertaken in July‐August 1974 and 1975, is a preliminary attempt to elucidate how these species partition the resources available to them, with particular emphasis upon roosting habits, food resources, and temporal and spatial differences in foraging behaviour. All three species give birth towards the beginning of the wet season and are probably polyoestrus. The larger species,\n              Epomophorus gambianus\n              , does not appear to compete with the other two due to differences in roosting habits and the food resources available to it consequent upon its larger size. The two smaller species,\n              Micropteropus pusillus\n              and\n              Nanonycteris veldkampi\n              , are similar in size.\n              N. veldkampi\n              is presumed absent from Mole in the dry season when food is scarce; in the wet season it may minimise competition by being better adapted for nectarivory, foraging later, and foraging at a greater height than\n              M. pusillus.",

Both species roosted within the internodes of one species of bamboo, but were only once found together at roost. Roosting groups, which formed before entry in the morning, were not limited in size by the dimensions of the roost site. In both species the sexes exhibited different roosting behaviour, the males tending to be solitary and the females gregarious. Seasonal variations in associations occurred correlated with the reproductive cycle. Banding demonstrated that the populations were highly mobile, that the bats frequently changed roost sites, and that the roosting associations were of an ephemeral nature.",

These bats are locally abundant in the Panama Canal Zone, and commonly roost in buildings such as the laboratory on Barro Colorado Island where this study was carried out. Homing experiments showed this species to be capable of returning to the roost from distances up to 50 km, but not from 104 km. Night roosting was not observed.\n            \n            \n              Little is known of the food habits of\n              M. nigricans\n              , except that they are insectivorous and probably take some Lepidoptera. The young are left behind in the roost when the females leave to forage at night. Females nurse only their own young and are able to pick them out of a group of 50‐100 youngsters upon returning in the mornings. During the day the bats undergo behavioural thermoregulation in the roost. These movements result in a mixing of the sexes which are otherwise segregated inside the roost, and copulation occurs at this time.",

Balionycteris maculata roosted in cavities and formed small harem groups that consisted of one adult male accompanied by up to nine adult females and their dependent young. Both male and female bats foraged locally, within approximately 1 km of their roost sites. However, in contrast to females, which remained away from the roost site throughout the night, both harem and solitary adult males divided their nightly activity between foraging and returning to their roost sites. Individual females were also found roosting sequentially with up to three different males. Hence, these results suggest that B. maculata has a resource-defence polygynous mating system, in which the roost cavity may represent a critical and defendable resource by which males recruit and gain improved reproductive access to females. Roost cavities occupied by B. maculata were found within a number of different forest structures, including ant nests, termite nests and the root masses of epiphytes. The consistent shape and position of the cavities, along with a single observation of cavity enlargement, provide the first evidence of roost-cavity excavation, by a megachiropteran bat, within the nests of social insects. Although the cues by which females select their roost sites are unclear, some aspect of roost cavity size, or condition, may provide a possible means by which females can assess the reproductive fitness of potential mates.",

Tents were most common in palm leaves that have supporting petioles angled at 50-70? above the horizontal. The shape and volume of tents is influenced mostly by leaf morphology (leaf width and leaflet length) and age of the tent. Tent-crowns varied from being heart-shaped in S. mauritiiformis, oval or round in C. barbadensis and spade-shaped in M. flexuosa.

Overall, 4 of 26 species (15%) at one site, and 6 of 33 species (18%) at the other site were frugivores, while the remainder were insectivores. In terms of individuals, 7-12% of all captures were frugivores. However, the true proportion of frugivores at both sites was probably closer to 1%, because the sampling procedures were strongly biased towards frugivores. In contrast, previously published studies indicate that frugivores comprise 34-48% of species, and up to 80% of individuals in bat communities in the understorey of Neotropical forest. These results support the hypothesis, developed from studies of bird communities, that the understorey of Malaysian dipterocarp forest supports relatively few obligate frugivores, at least in non-masting years. However, further data are required on bats in the canopy, and on the foraging ranges of bats to compare the absolute densities of bats in Malaysian and Neotropical forests.",

The diet consisted of 3 kinds of ﬁsh (Zacco platypus, Carassius auratus, and Phoxinus lagowskii) and at least 7 orders of insects (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Homoptera, Ephemeroptera, Hemiptera, Diptera, and Hymenoptera). Fragments of ﬁsh accounted for 67.1% and fragments of insects for 28% (by volume) of the diet; Z. platypus was the dominant food (60.1%), followed by Coleoptera (13.1%). Signiﬁcant differences existed between the proportion of ﬁsh and insects in the diet; however, no seasonal variation in the diet was found over the course of the investigation. This suggests that at this study site in Beijing, M. ricketti was highly specialized in foraging on only 1 species of ﬁsh and relied less on insects as alternative food sources, despite their seasonally high abundance.",

A total of 371 roosts was monitored for 503 roost-days after radiotracking 58 bats. Bats were solitary (37.3%) or communal (62.7%). Colonies were small, averaging 34.7 bats ± 23.4 SD. Reproductive females dominated colonies, and males roosted more often by themselves. C. tuberculatus differed from other species of bats because roost-site lability was extremely high (70% of sites occupied for only 1 night), bats did not cycle around a small number of preferred roosts, females carried their young to a new roost each day, and individuals abandoned each roost simultaneously as a group. Rates of reuse were low, with 301 new roost trees found >3 years of study. All sex and age classes switched frequently between solitary and communal roosts. Solitary roosts were occupied for longer times than colonial roosts. Reproductive females predominately (although not exclusively) used colonies during pregnancy and lactation but were more often solitary during post-lactation. Ratio of communal to solitary roosts in nonreproductive bats remained the same throughout summer, but adult males switched to communal roosts more often during post-lactation, presumably to mate. We suggest that suitable roosts were abundant allowing C. tuberculatus to move frequently in response to social and thermoregulatory requirements. If the pool of suitable trees were reduced, population viability may be affected.",

            "abstractNote": "We analyzed infrared video recordings from a maternity roost in southwestern Arizona to determine social behavior and time and activity budgets of adult Leptonycteris curasoae (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) for 2 weeks late in the nursing period. Between 2000 and 0330 h, females nursed their young an average of two times for a total of ca. 52 min. Females nursed only their own babies; they occasionally interacted with other young and adults. most frequently by touching noses. Adults returned to and left their young independently of each other, not in synchronized fashion. Between 0500 and 1900 h, adults seldom interacted, although they were clustered tightly. Young were in a nursing position, presumably nursing, ca. 50% of the time. Adults never appeared to sleep and spent 74% of the day quietly alert and 24% grooming themselves. We observed no cooperative behavior such as allogrooming, communal nursing, or sharing of food at any time. We suggest that absence of stable associations of adults caused by long-:-distance migration and occasional changes in roosting sites has prevented evolution of overtly cooperative behavior in dayroosts of L. curasoae.",

            "abstractNote": "Use by bats of basal hollows in old-growth redwoods was indexed using the weight of guano collected on water-permeable screens (guano traps) installed inside the trees. Twentysix trees were systematically selected from a stand that flanks both sides of an interstate highway in Del Norte Co., California. Traps were checked for guano once a month for 18 months. The quantity of guano collected each month and that every tree was used suggests that the trees served either as day roosts by small numbers of bats or as temporary night roosts. Although bats could not be identified on the basis of characteristics of guano, three fecal morphotypes were identified. Guano was found in all 26 trees during most of the sample periods; the greatest deposition occurred May through August. Surprisingly, there was a substantial amount of fresh guano collected from most trees during winter months. When all trees were considered, weight of guano was not significantly related to diameter at breast height (dbh) of the tree during summer, winter, or annually, but was related to the internal· volume of the hollow during summer and annually. Trees closer to perennial streams had greater weight of guano, but only during summer. The most frequently used trees had greater hollow volumes, greater diameters, and were closer to water than the least-frequently used trees. Although other potential roost sites on redwood trees were not sampled, our work indicates that large hollows are important roost sites. The relationship between weight of guano and size of hollow suggests that forests lacking trees large enough to contain these hollows will provide fewer roosting opportunities that could affect the abundance and diversity of bats.",

Including estimates of tissue production and milk export, w calculated that the average requirement for assimilated energy was 48.9 and 105.1 kJ/day f pregnant and lactating females, respectively. About 2% of the total energy required dur pregnancy was placed into fetal tissue; milk energy accounted for 28% of the energy assimila during lactation. Daily water flux was 8.47 and 17.07 ml/day for pregnant and lactating fema respectively. We calculated that E. fuscus obtained >66% of its water preformed in the diet, 20-22% of daily water intake was from drinking. Urinary water was the largest component water efflux during pregnancy (72%) and lactation (56%); water exported in milk represent 22% of daily water efflux during lactation. Calculated evaporative losses for free-ranging E. fusc were half those predicted from laboratory measurements.",

This opportunisti wait predator typically forages from the crowns of Acacia tortilis and captures insects broad range of elevations by brief, precise interceptions. Lavia is monogamous. Memb pair roost together in a territory defended by the male, forage either separately or toget share the territory for some 3 months with the single young. Acacia tortilis responds dry-season rains by flowering and growing new leaves; attending brief bursts of insect may be of crucial importance to Lavia during dry-season energy bottlenecks. Many of distinctive aspects of the life history of Lavia-monogamy, territoriality, the division opportunistic foraging, a long mother-young association, and a close association betw and A. tortilis-probably are adaptations to recurring periods of energy stress.",

The bats changed roost sites most daily but did not move to sites closer to current feeding areas. Relatively sta groups of one male and two or three females with young used and reused seve foliage sites in areas of 0.5 to 2.5 ha and commuted to feeding areas up to 2.5 km aw Sit-and-wait predators like owls seem to be attracted to fruiting trees. The bats su pended or greatly reduced feeding passes to fruiting trees during periods of brigh moonlight, but searching and commuting flights occurred even in the brightest moo light. Predation pressure is implicated in the evolution of both foraging and roostin behaviors.",

            "abstractNote": "A nursery population of M. sodalis was discovered in Indiana and studied for 2 years. The nursery roost was located under the loose bark of a dead tree. Sometimes the bats temporarily moved to bark crevices of a living shagbark hickory tree. Weather strongly affected roost microclimate. The nursery tree was unshaded and received maximal solar warmth during clear, mild or hot weather, whereas temperature at the shaded alternate tree was more stable during spring and autumn cold. The nursery population consisted of adult females and young, and few males were netted in local foraging areas. Each female bore a single young and these incurred eight percent mortality between birth and weaning. Social behaviors included \"checking,\" mothers carrying young to an apparently warmer portion of the roost tree, and apparent motheryoung foraging flights as the young became volant. Unusually cool weather in summer 1974 slowed the growth of young; this delayed recruitment of flying young more than 2 weeks and the completion of migration by 3 weeks. The delay exposed some bats to freezing weather at the nursery and may have affected mortality, autumn mating, or fat storage for winter. No problems were evident during the favorable summer of 1975. Foraging habitat included the foliage of riparian and floodplain trees, and the 50 bats used a 0.82 kilometer (km) linear strip of creek. Similar habitat was used by two other populations in Ohio. Before young were volant, adults fed only about riparian trees; when young began to fly, feeding extended to solitary trees and forest edge on the floodplain. This reduced foraging density from 17 to 11 bats per hectare (ha). Suitable foraging habitat occurs over much of the eastern United States, and use of local trees for nurseries makes a large summer distribution possible. Humans also value floodplain habitat, and a land use conflict exists between the two species.",

            "abstractNote": "Nocturnal behavior of the African false vampire bat (Cardioderma cor) was studied in bushland in southern Kenya, East Africa. Observations were made with a night-viewing device, and work was concentrated on the foraging strategy. This bat roosts in hollow baobab trees in groups of up to some 80 individuals. At night each bat occupies an exclusive foraging area. Individuals spend considerable time singing and establishing their exclusive areas during the March-April wet season when food is abundant; these areas have greatest survival value toward the end of the long May-October dry season, when food is in short supply, foraging occupies nearly the entire night, and singing is infrequent. Nocturnal time budget is characterized by long periods spent perching in low vegetation and listening for terrestrial prey. Flights to capture prey and between perches are brief and short, usually lasting less than 5 seconds and covering less than 25 meters. Food is typically captured on the ground, and consists primarily of large, ground-dwelling beetles, but centipedes and scorpions, and on rare occasions small bats, are also taken. During parts of the rainy seasons leaf gleaning and aerial captures of insects are important; at these times katydids (Tettigoniidae), locusts (Locustidae), and sphinx moths (Sphingidae) are major food items. Pronounced seasonal shifts in foraging behavior associated with the bimodal pattern of rainfall are discussed, and the evolution of the bat's unusual style of foraging is considered.",

            "abstractNote": "The hypothesis is presented that, because roosts are of survival value and bats have various adaptations for coloniality, the distribution and abundance of colonial Nearctic bats is determined largely by the availability of suitable roosts. Nearctic bat faunal size is correlated with the presence or absence of structures used for roosting. Both faunal size and community diversity vary in a geographically patchy rather than clinal fashion, implying little correlation with length of the growing season or diversity of insect communities. High bat diversity characterizes areas where all types of roost structures occur, whereas some kinds of roosts are missing in places of low bat diversity. A species' \"contribution to diversity\" (H'n) shows in which parts of its range it is an important contributor to its community. Each species uses particular sorts of roosts, and in summer a roost typically contains only one species. High survival rates, strong site attachment, and low natality rates are striking demographic adaptations of the more colonial species. Probably the key benefits of roosts are physiological advantages ensuring optimal growth of embryos and young and successful overwintering. Possible physiological and behavioral adaptations that may enable bats to take full advantage of roosts are suggested. I anticipate that the interaction of physiological requirements with the opportunities provided by summer and winter roosts will dominate future explanations of the distribution and relative abundances of temperate zone bats. The importance of roosts indicates that roosts should be managed as a key feature of the habitat of bats whose populations are in need of protection.",

One hundred forty-two Ficus trees in 25 ha were mapped and their fruit production monitored for 2 yr. Radio-tracking observations of foraging A. jamaicensis revealed that each bat carries away 9 ? 2 figs per night, enough to provide 40% more than the 43.9 kJ needed daily for basal metabolism and minimum maintenance flying. The estimated 6 ? 2A. jamaicensis per ha carried away ?7% of the 200,000 figs (650 kg) produced annually per hectare. Artibeus jamaicensis appears to be the most important dispersal agent for fig seeds in this area.

            "abstractNote": "The foraging movements of a Neotropical frugivorous bat (Carollia perspicillata) were studied to better understand its impact on the plants it disperses and the factors influencing its foraging behavior. Radio telemetry was used during 2 wet seasons to monitor the bats' movements in a Costa Rican seasonal tropical forest. We monitored 24 individuals for periods of up to 19 nights. This sample size permitted a statistical analysis of the influence of bats' weight, bat's sex, moonlight, and the distribution of resources on foraging patterns. Carollia perspicillata is a refuging species: individuals dispersed from shared day roosts to feed at night, then returned after foraging. At night there were 3 major activity periods, but there was some activity all night. When foraging, each individual went to 2 to 6 feeding areas that were used consistently through the observation period. Each night it flew back and forth between areas. Searching for new feeding areas was uncommon. Average flight distances for individuals were 1.6 kilometres between the day roost and feeding areas, 1.5 km among feeding areas, and 1.6 km to gather fruits within feeding areas. The density at feeding areas decreased with distance from the day roost, as predicted by refuging theory. There was little overlap among different individuals' feeding areas, but the largest amount of overlap was adjacent to 1 day roost. Bats from the 2 major day roosts shared feeding areas only at locations midway between the roosts. Flight patterns were influenced by bats' weights, the patchiness of resources, and the amount of moonlight. From these and other observations, we infer that both predation and energetic considerNations affect C. perspicillata foraging. In addition, this species appears to respond to long-term factors as well as night-to-night conditions so that dynamic models will be necessary to describe its foraging. Key words: Bats; Carollia perspicillata; Chiroptera; coei'olution; Costa Rica; energetics; foraging; jrugivlorxy; neotropics; predation; radio telemetry; refuging; resource distribution.",

Chiropterans are known for hosting a large diversity of viruses, in some cases with little or no effect to their health. Here, we report on the results of a screening for DNA (Herpesviridae) and RNA viruses (Rhabdovirus and Pneumovirus), ﬁnding a high prevalence and wide diversity of both Beta- and Gamma-Herpesvirus in insectivorous and hematophagous bats of the southern cone of South America. Our ﬁndings suggest that bats in the southern neotropics harbor a high diversity of herpesviruses and, at least in some cases, the viral community in the bat species is more strongly associated with ecological traits of the hosts, rather than their taxonomy. The presence of a separate clade into the Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily in the common vampire bat suggests the independent circulation of herpesviruses in hematophagous and insectivorous bats and highlights the properness of these viruses to track vampire bats’ population structure for rabies studies. Hence, we suggest that as other pathogens viruses may be used to track the population dynamics of their hosts, including movement and demographics.",

Following two severe cyclonic storms, we examined their differential behavioral responses and evaluated the effectiveness of recently established reserves in providing refugia. Although the cyclones disrupted activity patterns and foraging behavior for both species, comparisons witl.h pre-storm data suggested that the more common, widely distributed P. tonganus experienced more severe population declines than the endemic P. samoensis. This differential mortality could be explained by a combination of ecological and behavioralfactors. P. tonganus had a greater tendency to enter villages to feed on fallen cultivated fruits, making it more vulnerable to human hunting and predation by domestic animals. In addition, P. samoensis appeared to use survival strategies not observed in P. tonganus. Leaves, which were far more available than flowers or fruits in the immediate post-storm period, comprised a major part of the post-storm diet of P. samoensis. This species also fed on the fleshy bracts of a storm-resistcant native liana, (Freycinetia reineckei). In contrast, a seasonally important food of P. tonganus is nectar from the delicate flowers of Syzygium inophylloides (asi), a canopy tree that is very vulnerable to wind damage and has become increasing scarce with the clearing of lowland forest. Rainforest reserves, established prior to the storms, served as adequate refugia for local P. samoensis populations, which appeared to feed relatively close to their roosts, primarily in native forest, but did not protect P. tonganus populations, whicb traveled outside reserves to forage in areas lacking hunting bans. Although wind damage was patchy and not consistent between storms, areas of high topographic complexity (e.g., volcanic cones and deep valleys) were the most likely to retain areas with some foliage and should be given priority in the design offuture reserves.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract—\n              Several phylogenies have been proposed for neotropical stenodermatine fruit‐eating bats (Phyllostomidae), based on detention, external morphology, osteology and chromosomes. However, these previous analyses did not incorporate fully the idea that relationships should be identified based solely on shared derived characteristics. A critique of past methodology and results, and an alternative phylogeny using a morphological data set supplemented with karyotypic information, is presented. In my analysis, there appear two main lineages. The eight genera of white‐shouldered bats form a monophyletic clade based on three synapomorphies (white patch of fur on shoulders, lack of a palatial extension with varying degrees of emargination and modified upper incisors); previous work suggested a paraphyletic relationship for this group. Furthermore, the monophyly of the four genera endemic to the Antilles is supported by two synapomorphies, suggesting a common origin as opposed to a multiple invasion for these genera. The appearance of the derived 2n = 30 and FN = 56 standard karyotype suggests that the morphologically distinct\n              Sturnira\n              forms the sister taxon to the remaining genera which are united by the synapomorphy of white facial stripes. This supports the inclusion of\n              Sturnira\n              within the stendodermatines and not in its own monotypic higher‐level taxon. My results do not refute the traditional systematic view of\n              Artibeus\n              (including\n              Dermanura, Koopmania\n              and\n              Enchisthenes\n              ) being monophyletic, and supports\n              Mesophylla\n              and\n              Vampyressa\n              being distinct non‐sister genera.",

We found a total of 21 roost trees: 14 roosts were beneath loose bark, 5 were in cavities excavated by woodpeckers, and 2 were in natural cavities. Entrance height increased with tree height, but roost entrances tended to be situated below the level of the canopy. Of the 22 tree and site variables examined, only 3 significantly discriminated between roost trees and available trees: tree height, distance to the nearest available tree, and percent canopy closure. Bats preferred tall trees associated with low percent canopy closure and a short distance to the nearest available tree. Bats roosted in western white pine, and to a lesser extent ponderosa pine and western larch, in intermediate stages of decay more often than would be expected at random. Bats switched roosts frequently. The distance between Subsequent roost trees was short, suggesting a degree of fidelity to a particular group of trees or area of forest. The number of days of rain during the roosting period significantly influenced the number of days spent in a particular roost, and thus ambient conditions may restrict the frequency with which bats can switch roosts.",

We examined the use of torpor during the day by male and female big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in the field during the female gestation, lactation, and postlactation periods. While both sexes used torpor, males used it significantly more often and used deeper torpor than did reproductive females, indicating that the costs of torpor are higher for reproductive females. We suggest that by using shallow torpor, females may gain some of the benefits of torpor while minimizing the fitness costs. The different patterns of torpor may be responsible for observed differences in day-roost location amongst males, reproductive females, and nonreproductive females. Males should choose roosts with lower ambient temperatures than do females in order to increase the energy savings of torpor. Males and nonreproductive females roosted away from the maternity colonies more often than did reproductive females. Within one maternity colony, males roosted in the west end of the colony, while females roosted in the east end. These patterns of roosting may be related to how the roost warms during the day.",

We used the wash-out rate of tritiated water from the body water pool to calculate daily water flux in 10 pregnant and 14 lactating little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus). Average water influx was 6.16 ± 0.47 (SE) mL/day during pregnancy and 6.91 ± 0.37 mL/day during lactation; average efflux was 6.27 ± 0.44 and 7.07 ± 0.36 mL/day during pregnancy and lactation, respectively. Using data from the literature, we partitioned daily flux into major components. Our calculations indicated that most (> 62%) water influx was preformed water in the insect diet. Drinking water represented 23–26% of daily influx. Although previous studies indicated that evaporative losses greatly exceeded urinary losses in laboratory-maintained M. lucifugus, urinary and evaporative losses were comparable in our free-ranging bats. Urinary losses represented 46% of water efflux during pregnancy and 35% during lactation. Over 80% of all water efflux occurs during the 8-h night.",

Although the species roosted in different locations (S. borbonicus in hollow mopane trees, R. hildebrandti in a hollow baobab tree, and T. midas in buildings), roost temperatures and the bats' body temperatures were generally similar. The S. borbonicus and T. midas flew continuously while foraging in pursuit of flying prey; the R. hildebrandti switched between continuous flight, and hunting from a perch also in pursuit of flying prey. All three species foraged for about 60 min nightly, but the T. midas ventured at least 10 km from their roosts, while for S. borbonicus and R. hildebrandti, comparable figures were 4 and 2 km, respectively. The three species showed a spectrum of wing morphology and echolocation call design features from clutter resistant (R. hildebrandti) to relatively clutter resistant (S. borbonicus) and clutter intolerant (T. midas) and the foraging areas used by the bats corresponded to these features. Rhinolophus hildebrandti foraged below the canopy in riverine forest and deciduous woodland, while S. borbonicus foraged around the canopy but not closer than 0.5 m to it, while T. midas foraged in the open well above the canopy. These differences are discussed along with variations in foraging behaviour in insectivorous bats.",

A total of 6400 bats was handled during studies of swarming at 10 hibernacula in Ontario and Quebec from 1966 to 1968. Juveniles comprised over 50% of the swarming population, and the proportion of females in this population was greater than that observed in hibernating populations. Two phases of swarming have been distinguished: the first, occurring in August, lacks both sexual activity and a hibernating population, and the second, which begins in September, involves both sexual activity and the buildup of a hibernating population. Possible functions of swarming are discussed.",

Techniques included radio-tracking in a tropical lowland forest in Panama and analysis of data from long-term studies in Panama and Venezuela. Day roosts of T. silvicola were in arboreal termite nests. T. cirrhosus roosted in a hollow tree. T. silvicola emerged late (ca 60 min after sunset), and foraged close to the roosts (maximum distance 200-500 m). T. cirrhosus emerged early (ca 30 min after local sunset), and foraged farther from its roost (>1.5 km). Both bats used small foraging areas (3-12 ha) in tall, open forest. They foraged in continuous flight (maximum 27-36 min) or in short sally flights (<1 minute) from perches (\"hang-and-wait\" strategy). The small foraging areas of these bats and their sedentary foraging mode most likely make them vulnerable to habitat fragmentation.",

This provided a rare opportunity to evaluate the eff infrequent but large scale and high intensity disturbance on tropical bat species. Data on demographic p of three common phyllostomid bats (Artibeusjamaicensis, Stenoderma rufum, and Monophyllus redmani) wer for three years prior and three years after the hurricane. Population levels as estimated by captures per ne all three species were affected by Hurricane Hugo. Populations of A. jamaicensis and M. redmani retu predisturbance levels within two years. In contrast, population levels of S. rufum declined to about 30 prehurricane levels and have not recovered after three years. Moreover, telemetry data indicate that fora home range size expanded to encompass an area approximately five times larger than its prehurricane size of foraging, in terms of time and energy, may be considerably elevated over prehurricane scenarios. In fact, a s change in the age structure of the population (juvenile individuals have been absent from the popula Hurricane Hugo) as well as significant decline in the percent of reproductively active females indicate a fa reproduce in the posthurricane environment.",

All were constructed in the terminal blade of unseparated pinnae in fronds of Astrocaryum macrocalyx Burret (Palmae). Tents generally were not found in fronds of A. macrocalyx shorter than 2 m or longer than 4 m, or in other species of palms or broad-leaved plants that have been reported to harbor tent roosts of bats. The proximal four to nine unseparated pinnae of the terminal blade were severed to form the tent. Tents averaged 50.7 cm long, 17.1 cm maximum width, and 16.7 cm maximum depth, and were an average of 2.33 m above the ground. From one to seven bats were present in the four occupied tents but were not present in a tent every day. The density of active tents was ca 0.74/ha.",

There was marked seasonal variation in the prey taken, with bats and frogs dominating the biomass at different times. In November 1987, all-night radio-tracking over 15 bat nights revealed significant differences in habitat use between individuals, with one bat foraging along and over the Zambezi River, and another foraging in Acacia albida woodland and over the river. The bats alternated between foraging from continuous flight and making short flights from perches, although foraging over the river usually entailed continuous flight. Significant differences in the use of these foraging strategies between 1987 and an earlier study coincided with differences in November rainfall, and a drastic reduction in the amount of food the bats consumed daily.",

Most clusters consisted of 2-14 pregnant or lactating females (and their young) and a single adult male. This suggests a harem type of social organization. Two types of non-harem groups represented by nonreproductive females or sexually mature males supports this conclusion. Although our observations do not permit distinction between alternative explanations for harem formation, they do indicate that successful harem aquisition and maintenance is age or size related. Older and heavier males had larger harems than younger or smaller harem males. The occurrence of harem groups in tree hollows (Morrison 1979) and in caves (this study) suggests that environmental factors promoting harem social organization in A. jaamaicensis can vary between populations.",

Herein we report tent-making by a fifth species, Artibeus jamaicensis (Chiroptera: Phyllostomatidae). In addition we report bat tents from Scheelea rostrata, Geonoma congesta, Bactris wendlandian, and Asterogyne martiana, four species of palms not previously known to harbor them. A review of the plants used by bats for tents reveals a preference for species with a broad leaf surface, though pinnate leaf forms may also be used. Tents may provide effective protection from predators through total concealment or through the disruptive pattern presented. Tents in species with broad leaves probably require less effort for construction and provide better protection from the weather.",
