In this study, R. ferrumequinum korai showed a distinct reproductive cycle, unlike other hibernating bat species. The testicular reproductive cycle of R. ferrumequinum korai consists of three main stages. The ﬁrst is the spermatogenesis stage (from April to September), including spermatocytogenesis (which appears from April to May) and spermiogenesis (from June to September). The activity of spermatogenesis was highest in August. The lumen of seminiferous tubules was open from mid-April to mid-October. It was closed from November to March of the following year. The second stage is the phagocytosis stage (from mid-October to mid-November), which is a puriﬁcation process to prepare for new spermatogenesis the following year. This period is called the cleansing period. The third is the dormant stage – that is, a state of holding only spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. It is an adaptation strategy to store energy for long periods of hibernation. Compared to previous studies, spermatogenesis period preceded 1 month earlier. This suggests that temperature increase can impact reproductive development and spermatogenesis.",

The caudal epididymal reproductive cycle consisted of two successive purge stages. The ﬁrst stage of sperm disappearance occurred from April to June. This was a preparation phase for accepting new sperm produced by spermatogenesis, and entailed removing long-stored spermatozoa from the cauda epididymis during the long hibernation period. The second stage of sperm disappearance occurred from July to August, to remove malformed spermatozoa and other residues that were formed during the spermatogenesis process. Therefore, cauda epididymis cleansing lasts about 5 months, from April to August. This period is called the cleansing period. Sperm destruction was achieved by regulating leukocyte phagocytosis and the secretion and uptake by epithelial cells of cauda epididymis. Compared to the author’s previous studies, morphological traits of the cauda epididymis changed 1 month earlier. This suggests that temperature increase can impact reproductive development of the epididymis. Caudal epididymal sperm did not show any sudden morphological change during the long hibernation period after mating. This might be related to a low metabolic rate during hibernation.",

            "abstractNote": "Closely related species have been used as representative systems to investigate the genetic mechanisms involved in the early stages of species differentiation. Previous studies have indicated that variation in gene expression might be a sensitive indicator of initial species divergence, although the role of expression divergence, and especially that associated with phenotypic variation remained relatively undefined. For three organs (cochlea, brain, and liver) from two closely related bat species (Rhinolophus siamensis and R. episcopus), the interspecific and intersubspecific gene expression profiles were compared using transcriptomics in this study. Striking organ specificity of expression was observed, and expression profiles exhibited similarities between cochlea and brain tissues. Numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for each organ in the interspecific comparison (cochlea/brain/liver: 1,069/647/692) and intersubspecific comparison (608/528/368). Functional enrichment analysis indicated vital variation in expression related to the immune system, ion activities, neuronal function, and multisensory system regulation in both comparisons. DEGs relevant to the variation in echolocation calls (RF) were found, and some of them were involved in the pivotal patterns of expression variation. The regulation of immune, ion channel, neural activity, and sophisticated sensory functions at the expression level might be key mechanisms in the early species divergence of bats, and the expression variation related to acoustical signal could have played a crucial part. This study expands our knowledge of gene expression and patterns of variation for three key organs to echolocation at both the interspecific and intersubspecific levels. Further, the framework described here provides insight into the genetic basis of phenotypic variation during the incipient stage of species differentiation.",

However, little is known about their roles in generating novel phenotypes and phenotypic variation during the course of animal evolution. Here, we, for the first time, characterized the miRNAs of the cochlea in an echolocating bat (Rhinolophus affinis). We sampled eight individuals from two R. affinis subspecies with significant echolocation call frequency differences. We identified 365 miRNAs and 121 of them were novel. By searching sequences of these miRNAs precursors in multiple high-­quality mammal genomes, we found one specific miRNA shared by all echolocating bats but not present in all other nonecholocating mammals. The targeted genes of this miRNA included several known hearing genes (e.g., KCNQ4 and GJB6). Together with the matched mRNA-­seq data, we identified 1766 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two subspecies and 555 of them were negatively regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). We found that almost half of known hearing genes in the list of all DEGs were regulated negatively by DEMs, suggesting an important role of miRNAs in call frequency variation of the two subspecies. These targeted DEGs included several important hearing genes (e.g., Piezo1, Piezo2, and CDH23) that have been shown to be important in ultrasonic hearing of echolocating mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "Because of its complicated systematics, the bent-winged bat is one of the most frequently studied bat species groups. In China, two morphologically similar bent-winged bat species, Miniopterus fuliginosus and Miniopterus magnater were identiﬁed, but their distribution range and genetic differentiation are largely unexplored. In this study, we applied DNA bar codes and two other mitochondrial DNA genes including morphological parameters to determine the phylogeny, genetic differentiation, spatial distribution, and morphological difference of the M. fuliginosus and M. magnater sampled from China and one site in Vietnam. Mitochondrial DNA gene genealogies revealed two monophyletic lineages throughout the Tropic of Cancer. According to DNA bar code divergences, one is M. fuliginosus corresponding to the Chinese mainland and the other is M. magnater corresponding to tropical regions including Hainan and Guangdong provinces of China and Vietnam. Their most recent common ancestor was dated to the early stage of the Quaternary glacial period (ca. 2.26 million years ago [Ma] on the basis of D-loop data, and ca. 1.69–2.37 Ma according to ND2). A population expansion event was inferred for populations of M. fuliginosus at 0.14 Ma. The two species probably arose in separate Pleistocene refugia under different climate zones. They signiﬁcantly differed in forearm length, maxillary third molar width, and greatest length of the skull.",

            "abstractNote": "Since European settlement in Australia, the geographical range of ghost bats (Macroderma gigas) has contracted northwards. Ghost bats are thought to occur in disjunct populations with little interpopulation migration, raising concerns over the current status and future viability of the southernmost colony, which has also been threatened by mining activity. To address these concerns, demographic parameters of the southernmost colony were estimated from a mark–recapture study conducted during 1975–1981. Female bats gave birth to a single young in late spring, but only 40% (22–70%, 95% CI) of females bred in their second year, increasing to 93% (87–97%, 95% CI) for females ≥ 2 years old. Sixty-ﬁve percent of juveniles caught were female. Annual adult survival ranged between 0.57–0.77 for females and 0.43–0.66 for males, and was lowest over winter–spring and greatest in autumn–winter. Juvenile survival for the ﬁrst year ranged between 0.35–0.46 for females and 0.29–0.42 for males. Adult survival varied among seasons, was negatively associated with rainfall, but was not associated with temperature beyond being lower in late winter. Poor survival may result from the inferior daytime roosts that bats must use if water seepage forces them to leave their normal roosts. Although these age-speciﬁc rates of fecundity and survival suggested a declining population, mark–recapture estimates of the population trend indicated stability over the study period. Counts at daytime roosts also suggested a population decline, but were considered unreliable because of an increasing tendency of bats to avoid detection. It is therefore likely that some assumptions in estimating survival were violated. These results provide a caution against the uncritical use of population projections derived from mark–recapture estimates of demographic parameters, and the use of untested indices as the basis for conservation decisions.",

            "abstractNote": "A vaccine that effectively protects immunocompromised patients against invasive aspergillosis is a novel approach to a universally fatal disease. Here we present a rationale for selection and in vivo testing of potential protein vaccine candidates, based on the modification of an immunodominant fungal allergen for which we demonstrate immunoprotective properties. Pulmonary exposure to viable Aspergillus fumigatus conidia as well as vaccination with crude hyphal extracts protects corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mice against invasive aspergillosis (J. I. Ito and J. M. Lyons, J. Infect. Dis. 186:869-871, 2002). Sera from the latter animals contain antibodies with numerous and diverse antigen specificities, whereas sera from conidium-exposed mice contain antibodies predominantly against allergen Asp f 3 (and some against Asp f 1), as identified by mass spectrometry. Subcutaneous immunization with recombinant Asp f 3 (rAsp f 3) but not with Asp f 1 was protective. The lungs of Asp f 3-vaccinated survivors were free of hyphae and showed only a patchy low-density infiltrate of mononuclear cells. In contrast, the nonimmunized animals died with invasive hyphal elements and a compact peribronchial infiltrate of predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Three truncated versions of rAsp f 3, spanning amino acid residues 15 to 168 [rAsp f 3(15-168)], 1 to 142, and 15 to 142 and lacking the known bipartite sequence required for IgE binding, were also shown to be protective. Remarkably, vaccination with either rAsp f 3(1-142) or rAsp f 3(15-168) drastically diminished the production of antigen-specific antibodies compared to vaccination with the full-length rAsp f 3(1-168) or the double-truncated rAsp f 3(15-142) version. Our findings point to a possible mechanism in which Asp f 3 vaccination induces a cellular immune response that upon infection results in the activation of lymphocytes that in turn enhances and/or restores the function of corticosteroid-suppressed macrophages to clear fungal elements in the lungs.",

            "abstractNote": "Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are one of many species within zoologic collections that frequently develop iron storage disease. The goals of this retrospective multi-institutional study were to determine the tissue distribution of iron storage in captive adult Egyptian fruit bats and the incidence of intercurrent neoplasia and infection, which may be directly or indirectly related to iron overload. Tissue sections from 83 adult Egyptian fruit bats were histologically evaluated by using tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, and Prussian blue techniques. The liver and spleen consistently had the largest amount of iron, but signiﬁcant amounts of iron were also detected in the pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, and lung. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 11) was the most common neoplasm, followed by cholangiocarcinoma (4). Extrahepatic neoplasms included bronchioloalveolar adenoma (3), pulmonary carcinosarcoma (1), oral sarcoma (1), renal adenocarcinoma (1), transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (1), mammary gland adenoma (1), and parathyroid adenoma (1). There were also metastatic neoplasms of undetermined primary origin that included three poorly differentiated carcinomas, a poorly differentiated sarcoma, and a neuroendocrine tumor. Bats with hemochromatosis were signiﬁcantly more likely to have HCC than bats with hemosiderosis (P ¼ 0.032). Cardiomyopathy was identiﬁed in 35/77 bats with evaluable heart tissue, but no direct association was found between cardiac damage and the amount of iron observed within the liver or heart. Hepatic abscesses occurred in multiple bats, although a signiﬁcant association was not observed between hemochromatosis and bacterial infection. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst publication providing evidence of a positive correlation between hemochromatosis and HCC in any species other than humans.",

The pellets collected at 152 sites in central and north-eastern Poland in the years 1990–2008 comprised 17,908 items of vertebrate prey, of which 115 (0.64%) were bats. Tawny owls caught 11 bat species, most frequently Nyctalus noctula, Plecotus auritus and Eptesicus serotinus. The analysis revealed habitat-related differences to the proportions of all tawny owl prey items accounted for by bats, being the highest in urban habitats (2.0%) and suburban forests (0.8%), and the lowest in forest interiors (0.1%). Bat frequency in the diet of tawny owls correlated negatively with that of other mammals pooled together with amphibians. Myotis nattereri and ‘‘aerial hawkers’’ (vs. ‘‘gleaners’’) were taken significantly more often in habitats associated with a large city (parks and suburban forests), and P. auritus in non-urban habitats.",

Diets were determined from microscopic analysis of fecal pellets and compared with arthropods collected in Malaise traps. Although lepidopterans comprised only 21.5% of the available prey, they occurred in > 90% of the pellets examined and accounted for > 85% of the volume of prey consumed. Dipterans, coleopterans, and homopterans occurred in 18.3%, 10.6%, and 6.7% of the feces, respectively, but each accounted for < 5% of the volume of prey consumed. Trichopterans, hymenopterans, and neuropterans also were found in feces but in trace amounts. Our results support the classification of C. t. ingens as a moth specialist, but additional insights are needed to fully understand how its feeding tactics conform to the allotonic frequency hypothesis (i.e., avoiding detection by eared moths). Conservation of this highly endangered North American bat will require, in part, maintenance of habitats capable of supporting abundant populations of Lepidoptera.",

Despite their prevalence in urban environments, limited research has been conducted to determine the features of buildings or of the surroundings that might affect the likelihood of a building being selected by Mexican free-tailed bats as a roost. Our study objectives were to improve the current understanding of Mexican free-tailed bat’s urban roosting preferences with regard to both microhabitat and macrohabitat. Between August 2010 and August 2012, we conducted acoustic surveys and emergence observations and examined 218 buildings in Waco, TX, USA. A total of 54 day-roosts for Mexican free-tailed bats was identified. At the microhabitat scale, modeling of building characteristics and opening characteristics showed that bats preferred to roost in tall and abandoned buildings. Roost exits were more likely the results of structural damage to buildings and less likely to have vegetation blocking the adjacent air space. Roost accessibility seemed to be more important than thermal condition in roost selection. At the broader macrohabitat scale, bats were more likely to roost in areas with lower income and were near tall buildings and water sources.",

Eared moths perform evasive flight manoeuvres upon hearing approaching bats, thereby substantially increasing survival probability. Accordingly, eared moths constitute only a minor portion of many bats’ diets. In contrast, the barbastelle bat\n                      Barbastella barbastellus\n                      almost exclusively feeds on eared moths by emitting low‐amplitude stealth echolocation calls that are undetectable by distant moths. While closing in on the prey, however, the calls might become audible. We thus hypothesised that barbastelle bats lower the source level of their calls even further while closing in, such that the level at the moth's ear remains below the moth's hearing threshold and the moth fails to elicit its evasive manoeuvre.\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    We tested these hypotheses by offering tethered moths to barbastelle bats in the wild and in captivity. We reconstructed the bats’ three‐dimensional flight paths based on time‐of‐arrival differences of the echolocation calls at four microphones, measured the received sound levels at the moth's position with an additional miniature microphone, and calculated call source levels.\n                  \n                  \n                    We show that barbastelle bats continuously reduced source level upon detecting a moth, thereby delaying the time and shortening the distance when the moth might detect the bat. The received level at the targeted moth never exceeded the moth's neuronal hearing threshold by more than 10 dB, which is likely sufficiently low to prevent moth evasive flight.\n                  \n                  \n                    Barbastelle bats emit low‐amplitude calls to counter moth hearing. Continued amplitude reduction during an attack extends the time before the prey becomes aware of the predator, if at all. In combination, these two strategies allowed barbastelle bats to access a food resource which is largely unavailable to competing species, thereby probably altering competition between sympatric predators.\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                A\n                plain language summary\n                is available for this article.",

            "abstractNote": "The remarkable high-frequency sensitivity and selectivity of the mammalian auditory system has been attributed to the evolution of mechanical amplification, in which sound waves are amplified by outer hair cells in the cochlea. This process is driven by the recently discovered protein prestin, encoded by the gene\n              Prestin\n              . Echolocating bats use ultrasound for orientation and hunting and possess the highest frequency hearing of all mammals. To test for the involvement of\n              Prestin\n              in the evolution of bat echolocation, we sequenced the coding region in echolocating and nonecholocating species. The resulting putative gene tree showed strong support for a monophyletic assemblage of echolocating species, conflicting with the species phylogeny in which echolocators are paraphyletic. We reject the possibilities that this conflict arises from either gene duplication and loss or relaxed selection in nonecholocating fruit bats. Instead, we hypothesize that the putative gene tree reflects convergence at stretches of functional importance. Convergence is supported by the recovery of the species tree from alignments of hydrophobic transmembrane domains, and the putative gene tree from the intra- and extracellular domains. We also found evidence that\n              Prestin\n              has undergone Darwinian selection associated with the evolution of specialized constant-frequency echolocation, which is characterized by sharp auditory tuning. Our study of a hearing gene in bats strongly implicates\n              Prestin\n              in the evolution of echolocation, and suggests independent evolution of high-frequency hearing in bats. These results highlight the potential problems of extracting phylogenetic signals from functional genes that may be prone to convergence.",

It is possible that variation may also exist between genders in the use of different prey types. However, until recently this idea was difficult to test owing to poorly resolved taxonomy of dietary studies. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing to describe gender-related variation in diet composition of the European free-tailed bat (\n              Tadarida teniotis\n              ), while controlling for effects of age and season. We analysed guano pellets collected from 143 individuals mist-netted from April to October 2012 and 2013, in northeast Portugal. Moths (Lepidoptera; mainly Noctuidae and Geometridae) were by far the most frequently recorded prey, occurring in nearly all samples and accounting for 96 out of 115 prey taxa. There were significant dietary differences between males and females, irrespective of age and season. Compared to males, females tended to consume larger moths and more moths of migratory behaviour (e.g.\n              Autographa gamma\n              ). Our study provides the first example of gender-related dietary variation in bats, illustrating the value of novel molecular tools for revealing intraspecific variation in food resource use in bats and other insectivores.",

In the mild winter of 1994–1995, ﬂight cage temperatures never fell below 10ЊC. Bats were never observed to enter sustained (over 2 d) torpor. They were also never observed to mate. Unmanipulated, sham-operated, and gonadectomized males and unmanipulated females were exposed to 6 d of 4ЊC. All individuals appeared torpid, and body temperatures of monitored bats fell at least 15Њ–20ЊC. Plasma androgen levels of torpid unmanipulated, sham-operated, and gonadectomized males averaged 25.4 { 9.2, 19.7 { 9.1, and 1.5 { 0.25 ng/mL, respectively, and did not differ signiﬁcantly from levels for the same groups 1 mo previous to induced torpor. When animals were returned to 23ЊC, 57% of unmanipulated, 40% of the sham-operated, and 33% of gonadectomized males displayed mating behavior upon arousal. Almost all matings occurred within 48 h of arousal, the majority in the ﬁrst 3 h. Males not exposed to low temperatures were not observed to mate. Although individuals from all three treatments mated, gonadectomized males averaged fewer mounts and copulations per individual. Androgen levels declined signiﬁcantly from torpor levels in all groups 48 h after arousal. Thus, an extended period of low body temperature and arousal appeared to be a short-term activator of sexual behavior in the big brown bat; unmanipulated males were more strongly affected by this stimulus than gonadectomized males.",

            "abstractNote": "The Cimicidae is a family of blood‐dependent ectoparasites in which dispersion capacity is greatly associated with host movements. Bats are the ancestral and most prevalent hosts for cimicids. Cimicids have a worldwide distribution matching that of their hosts, but the global classification is incomplete, especially for species outside the most common Cimicidae taxa. In this study, we place a little‐studied cimicid species, Bucimex chilensis, within a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Cimicidae by sequencing the genomic regions of this and other closely related species. For this study, we collected B. chilensis females from Myotis chiloensis in Tierra del Fuego, 1,300 km further south than previously known southernmost distribution boundary. We also sequenced COI regions from Primicimex cavernis, a species which together with B. chilensis comprise the entire subfamily Primiciminae. Using Bayesian posterior probability and maximum‐likelihood approaches, we found that B. chilensis and P. cavernis clustered close to each other in the molecular analyses, receiving support from similar morphological features, agreeing with the morphology‐based taxonomic placement of the two species within the subfamily Primiciminae. We also describe a previously unrecognized morphological adaptation of the tarsal structure, which allows the austral bat ectoparasite, B. chilensis, to cling on to the pelage of its known host, the Chilean myotis (Myotis chiloensis). Through a morphological study and behavioral observation, we elucidate how this tarsal structure operates, and we hypothesize that by clinging in the host pelage, B. chilensis is able to disperse effectively to new areas despite low host density. This is a unique feature shared by P. cavernis, the only other species in Primiciminae.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Bats (Order: Chiroptera), including those of the genus\n              Eptesicus\n              , have been reported to serve as reservoirs of several zoonotic viruses. Notably, bats have been reported to lack obvious symptoms of infection with such viruses and are thought to have unique immune system responses. However, the responses of their innate immune system, the first line of immunity, remain largely unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the expression profiles in two\n              Eptesicus\n              bat cell lines to investigate their innate immune responses. The gene expression profiles after polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)] induction were similar between the two bat cell lines, but uniquely upregulated differentially expressed genes were also identified. We also revealed that the upregulated genes of\n              Eptesicus\n              bat cells were distinct from those of human epithelial cells in response to induction. Moreover, the basal expression levels of several immune‐related genes were higher in bat cells than in human cells. We also identified unannotated novel transcripts that were upregulated after induction and novel microRNAs expressed in bat cells, some of which were upregulated by poly (I:C) treatment. This is the first report to illustrate the innate immune response in\n              Eptesicus\n              bat cells; therefore, this study provides basic and novel insights into bat innate immunity. Our data represent a valuable resource for future studies into bat immunity and the biology of\n              Eptesicus\n              bats.",

Analysing DNA in scats through metabarcoding can reveal dietary items not preserved in faeces but also resolve dietary preferences to species level. DNA metabarcoding analysis of scats collected from six individual long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) from Whirinaki Forest Park revealed a predominance of aquatic insects (Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera) and small-bodied moths (Lepidoptera). This contrasts with earlier studies of faecal remains in this species which revealed a strong preference for Dipterans and Coleopterans. The use of DNA metabarcoding may provide a better understanding of diets, as soft-bodied insects can be detected even when not apparent in physical examinations of scat, and thus will allow for more robust comparison of diﬀerences in diets between populations and seasons. The application of DNA metabarcoding is a simple but high-resolution tool to allow further study on dietary preference in this endangered species.",

For small hibernators, torpid metabolic rate is temperature dependent and thus hibernation in warm hibernacula is predicted to be energetically costly. This species, however, rarely feeds during the hibernation season to offset the expected high energetic costs. In this study we used a respirometry system to quantify physiological characteristics of euthermic and torpid H. terasensis in winter. We tested the hypothesis that H. terasensis exhibits metabolic inhibition during torpor. Our results showed that H. terasensis saved 94.6% energy by using torpor at air temperatures of 15uC, compared with its euthermic metabolic rate at that air temperature. Torpor metabolic rate declined with declining air temperature to around 14uC, but then increased at lower air temperatures of 10–14uC. Above 14uC , the slope of 213.0uK 6 1.4uK between metabolic rates and body temperatures in an Arrhenius plot (or Q10 5 4.4) suggests that, in addition to direct temperature effects, H. terasensis exhibited metabolic inhibition during torpor. A model used to evaluate energy expenditure of H. terasensis showed that at 20uC and 23uC a 55-g bat needs 194 kJ (4.9 g fat) and 273.2 kJ (6.9 g fat), respectively, to survive a 70-day hibernation period.",

Previous researchers have hypothesized that demographic characteristics of populations may shift with changes in environmental conditions, with self-regulatory ability increasing with environmental suitability. We studied responses of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) to habitat disturbance. Given that optimal habitat for this species is deciduous woodland, we predicted that populations in habitats disturbed by cutting woody vegetation would be lower and more variable in density than in undisturbed habitat, density and stability of populations in disturbed habitat would increase over time, survival would be higher in undisturbed than in disturbed habitat, and populations in undisturbed habitat would show a greater degree of self-regulation. This 6year study in western Pennsylvania involved 3 replicated study sites (each 3.8 ha), with woody vegetation removed on half of each site prior to beginning the study. Density in disturbed treatment averaged 65% of density in undisturbed habitat. There were no differences between treatments in survival or in population growth rates over time. Population trends over time were similar between treatments, populations in disturbed habitat did not become more stable with time, and density did not converge with that of undisturbed habitat. Although populations in the undisturbed habitat were clearly self-regulating, those in disturbed habitats were not. Despite expectations that demographic performance will align with environmental suitability, it may be difficult to ascribe a particular demography to a habitat generalist such as P. leucopus.",

Little is known about its ecology. We used morphological analysis of droppings from an urban semiarid Mediterranean landscape to determine seasonal differences in diet. We identified 15 insect prey types and found significant seasonal differences in the consumption of seven prey types. The diet of E. isabellinus was dominated by Scarabaeidae (Coleoptera) and Diptera, and there were seasonal changes in the consumption of Carabidae (Coleoptera), Lepidoptera and Cercopidae (Hemiptera). Shannon-Wiener and Levins’ indices showed that the diet was more diverse during the post-hibernation and pregnancy periods. Pianka’s index showed that there was relatively low dietary overlap between periods. The seasonal changes recorded between different physiological periods could be related to changes in the energetic needs of the individual or to variation in preyavailability. Although E. isabellinus mainly eats Scarabaeidae and Diptera, it can show flexibility for example by hunting insects that fly around blossoms such as chafers Melolontha spp.",

Here we investigated spatial patterns of total Hg (THg) in fur from 10 little brown bat maternity colonies across Nova Scotia, and assessed relationships with the acidity of nearby lakes and rivers. Total Hg concentrations were measured in fur samples from 149 adult female little brown bats. Values showed signiﬁcant variation among colonies (mean range 3.76−27.38 μg/g, dry weight), and 48% of individuals had Hg concentrations in excess of the 10 μg/g threshold associated with neurochemical changes in Chiroptera conspeciﬁcs (n = 26) from Virginia. Average surface water acidity parameters (pH and acid neutralization capacity) within an 8 km radius of each maternity roost showed strong negative associations with average colony fur THg concentrations. This suggests that freshwater acidity in foraging grounds explains much of the variation in average fur THg concentrations in little brown bat colonies.

Deficiency of IFN-gamma but not IL-17A enhanced susceptibility of control mice to both infections. However, vaccine-induced protective immunity against both infections required CD4+ T-cell-derived IFN-gamma and IL-17A, and functional phagocytic effectors. Vaccination primed Th1, Th17, and Th1/17 lymphocytes, which produced pro-inflammatory cytokines that enhanced phagocytic killing of both organisms. Vaccinated, infected mice had increased IFN-gamma, IL-17, and KC, increased neutrophil influx, and decreased organism burden in tissues. In summary, rAls3p-N vaccination induced a Th1/Th17 response, resulting in recruitment and activation of phagocytes at sites of infection, and more effective clearance of S. aureus and C. albicans from tissues. Thus, vaccine-mediated adaptive immunity can protect against both infections by targeting microbes for destruction by innate effectors.",

            "abstractNote": "Ceiba pentandra is a tropical tree with high rates of selﬁng in some populations. In mixed-mating species, variation in selﬁng is due to changes in adult density or variability of incompatibility systems. The effect of spatial isolation and phenology on selﬁng rates and pollen ﬂow distances was analyzed using microsatellites in a fragmented population of Ceiba pentandra, in southern Costa Rica. Adult trees within a heterogeneous landscape were classiﬁed as grouped or isolated. We compared selﬁng rates at the individual level, between isolation conditions and 2 yr (2007, 2009), which differed in the number of ﬂowering individuals. Mixed mating was estimated in both years (tm = 0.624–0.759). Trees mated predominantly by outcrossing, while only a few trees reproduced through selﬁng. Spatial isolation did not signiﬁcantly affect outcrossing rates. The progeny of grouped trees was mostly sired by near-neighbors (<1 km) and by long-distance pollen ﬂow events in isolated trees. A reduction in the number of ﬂowering individuals in 2009 reduced near-neighbor matings, increased selﬁng in grouped trees, and decreased the number of unsampled sires in the progeny. Comparing selﬁng rates on individuals that ﬂowered in both reproductive periods suggests a ﬂexible mating system. Variation in self-fertilization rates in this population appears to depend on variation of individual traits, such as genetic variability in self-incompatibility genes, but it is independent of landscape heterogeneity. In contrast, pollen ﬂow distances depend on local tree density as bats concentrate their foraging between near individuals to maximize energy efﬁciency.",

            "abstractNote": "Neotropical bats of the genus Carollia are widely studied due to their abundance, distribution and relevance for ecosystems. However, the ecomorphological boundaries of these species are poorly differentiated, and consequently correspondence between their geographic distribution, ecological plasticity and morphological variation remains unclear. In this study, patterns of cranial and mandibular morphological variation were assessed for Carollia brevicauda, C. castanea and C. perspicillata from Colombia. Using geometric morphometrics, morphological variation was examined with respect to: differences in intraspecific variation, morphological modularity and integration, and biogeographic patterns. Patterns of intraspecific variation were different for each species in both cranial and mandibular morphology, with functional differences apparent according to diet. Cranial modularity varied between species whereas mandibular modularity did not. High cranial and mandibular correlation reflects Cranium-Mandible integration as a functional unit. Similarity between the biogeographic patterns in C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata indicates that the Andes do not act as a barrier but rather as an independent region, isolating the morphology of Andean populations of larger-bodied species. The biogeographic pattern for C. castanea was not associated with the physiography of the Andes, suggesting that large body size does not benefit C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata in maintaining homogeneous morphologies among populations.",

However, long-term studies on the demographic consequences of human disturbances are unusual. We used 6 years (1995–2000) of mark-recapture data to investigate how climatic conditions, human disturbance and density affect sex- and age-speciﬁc apparent survival probabilities of the pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Schreber 1774) in a maternity colony. Our study demonstrated that density played an important role in population dynamics of pipistrelle bat and that its effect differed with respect to age and sex. Notably, human disturbance caused a strong decline of adult female survival, suggesting that perturbations have important consequences in bat-colony dynamics. Juvenile female survival was negatively inﬂuenced by density, being considerably lower in high densities. In contrast, juvenile and adult males were apparently not affected as they had constant survival probabilities. Although climatic factors can markedly affect population dynamics of temperate insectivorous bats, in this study, the weather conditions did not inﬂuence the survival rates of pipistrelle bats. We provide the ﬁrst report that demonstrates the density-dependent effect on bat survival. That is especially relevant to better understanding of the bat-population dynamics and to evaluate the consequences of human disturbance and their potential changes in the maternity colony structure.",

Coleoptera (31.07%) were Carabidae, Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, Tenebrionidae, Aphodidae, Scarabaeidae, and Histeridae. Hymenoptera (21.31%) were Formicidae, Myrmicidae and Vespidae, Diptera (13.78%) were Culicidae and Tabanidae, and Orthoptera (11.40%) were Acrididae and Gryllidae. The autumn-winter diet (October to December) included a large amount of Odonata, Scarabaeidae, Blattodea, Acrididae and Myrmicidae. The spring-summer diet (February to August) was characterized mainly by Chrysomelidae, Vespidae, Tenebrionidae, Aphodidae and Araneae. As other desert bat species A. tridens displays a combination of opportunism and selective predation depending on the abundance of insect groups.",

We used AnaBat II bat detectors, mist-netting, and radio-telemetry to collect preliminary data on the distribution and status of bats on the Chugach National Forest (CNF), their activity patterns, and their roosting and foraging habitats. Myotis spp. were detected at 20 of 25 acoustic sampling sites. Bat activity tended to be higher at water sites than at road or trail sites, and higher in hardwood stands than in conifer stands, although these differences were not statistically significant. Based on data recorded at a maternity roost, the total activity period for bats during July was approximately 5 h per night; no bat activity was observed prior to sunset or after sunrise at any of the sites. Hourly activity was not related to temperature, but activity ended earlier on cooler nights. An adult male Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus) was tracked to a day-roost in a large Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis) snag with sloughing bark. Most female Little Brown Myotis captured at a maternity roost were either lactating or post-lactating. These preliminary findings suggest that bats are common on the CNF, but more research is needed to determine their habitat associations and their responses to disturbances including forest management practices, fire, insect outbreaks, climate change, and disease.",

            "abstractNote": "One of the most significant changes to Earth's climate in recent decades has been an increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves. During heatwaves, animal's thermal window can be exceeded, and in extreme cases, mass mortality events have been observed. In 2018, a heatwave in north-­eastern Australia resulted in the death of approximately one-­third of the spectacled flying-­ fox (Pteropus conspicillatus) population at urban roosts in Cairns. The species has now been listed as endangered with future heatwaves considered the greatest threat to its survival. In this study, we investigated long-­term climatic trends for Cairns, paying particular attention to the frequency of extreme heat events from 1943 to 2022. We then characterized the microclimate of urban flying-­fox roosts during the Austral summers of 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 across Cairns to assess the long-­term feasibility of urban spectacled flying-­fox roosts. From the long-­term climate records, we observed an overall increase in Cairns' average annual temperature of 1.3°C from 1943 to 2022 and an increase in the number of excessively hot days per decade, from 16 in the first decade (1943–1952) to 67 in the last (2013–2022). We regularly detected maximum roost temperatures of 30–35°C during our study, with excessively hot days (>35°C) recorded more frequently than expected compared to Cairns's maximum temperatures from the last decade (2013–2023). We detected only 1 day where roost temperatures exceeded 40°C and no period that replicated the 2018 heatwave conditions. Furthermore, we found a significant negative relationship between roost ambient temperature and humidity, where the hottest days also coincided with those with the lowest humidity. Importantly, we found no difference in microclimate between roosts that were occupied and unoccupied by flying-­foxes during our study, suggesting that other environmental or behavioural factors are more influential for roost selection than the roosting microclimate. Ensuring the long-­term conservation of spectacled flying-­foxes under a changing climate will require the management of urban roosts to increase their thermal resistance to heatwaves, and more research is needed to identify the variables modulating this aspect.",

            "abstractNote": "Although bats are one of the most successful and diverse of mammalian orders, studies that focus upon bat endoparasites are limited. To further knowledge of bat parasitology, pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus) were acquired from across the Greater Manchester and Lancashire region of England and examined for gastrointestinal helminths using morphological and molecular analyses†. Sixty-eight of 90 adult/juvenile bats (76% prevalence) were infected with at least 1 species of helminth and mean helminth abundance was 48·2 (+ / − 7·0). All helminths were digenean trematodes and the following species were identiﬁed in 51 P. pipistrellus specimens (prevalence in parentheses): Lecithodendrium linstowi (80·4%), L. spathulatum (19·6%), Prosthodendrium sp. (35·3%), Plagiorchis koreanus (29·4%) and Pycnoporus heteroporus (9·8%). Statistical analyses, incorporating multifactorial models, showed that male bats exhibited a signiﬁcantly more aggregated helminth distribution and lower abundance than females. Positive associations were observed between L. linstowi and L. spathulatum, Prosthodendrium sp. and P. heteroporus and between L. spathulatum and P. koreanus. A revised phylogeny of bat-associated Lecithodendriidae, incorporating novel L. spathulatum and Prosthodendrium sp. 28S rRNA sequences, separated the controversial clade formed by L. linstowi and P. hurkovaae. Further studies are likely to assist the understanding of bat-parasite/pathogen relationships, helminth infracommunity structures and phylogenetics.",

The carcasses of larger mammals were heavily ravaged by carnivores. Nearly 10,000 small-mammal remains appear to be derived primarily from decomposed owl pellets. The rich avifauna includes at least 29 species, mostly nonaquatic forms. Modern analogs of the most abundant birds and of a variety of rodents are associated with mesic woodland environments distant from large water bodies. These findings support inferences from associated geological, isotopic, invertebrate, and large-vertebrate assemblages. The combined results suggest that\n              Ar. ramidus\n              occupied a wooded Pliocene habitat.",

Comparison between these two biogeographic systems provides an opportunity to investigate the relative role of isolation in phylogeographic patterns and to elucidate the importance of evolution and demographic history in population structure. Herein, we use a genotypeby-sequencing approach (GBS) to explore population structure within three species of mastiff bats (Molossus molossus, M. coibensis, and M. milleri), which represent different ecological histories and geographical distributions in the genus. We tested the hypotheses that oceanic straits serve as barriers to dispersal in Caribbean bats and that isolated island populations are more likely to experience genetic drift and bottlenecks in comparison with highly connected ones, thus leading to different phylogeographic patterns. We show that population structures vary according to general habitat preferences, levels of population isolation, and historical fluctuations in climate. In our dataset, mainland geographic barriers played only a small role in isolation of lineages. However, oceanic straits posed a partial barrier to the dispersal for some populations within some species (M. milleri), but do not seem to disrupt gene flow in others (M. molossus). Lineages on distant islands undergo genetic bottlenecks more frequently than island lineages closer to the mainland, which have a greater exchange of haplotypes.",

Here, we reported the complete mitogenome sequence of P. vampyrus, which was 16,554 bp and composed of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, and one control region, with a base composition of lower G+C content (41.5%). Like other bats, all genes were located on H-strand except for eight tRNA and ND6 genes. Most protein-coding genes started with an ATG codon except for ND2, ND3, and ND5, which initiated with ATA or ATT instead, and terminated with the typical stop codon (TAA/TAG) or a single T or an unexpected codon of AGG. Within the control region, 6 bp repeat (TACGCA) was appeared only nine times, much lower than other published Pteropus species. These results provided basic information for researching Pteropus vampyrus on genetics, phylogeny, and adaptive evolution.",

We examined roost use and selection by Rafinesque’s big-eared bat at the tree, stand, and landscape scales during the maternity season in pristine old-growth habitat in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina. We located 43 roosts (14 maternity, 29 solitary) through cavity searches and radio-telemetry. Maternity colonies and solitary individuals selected roosts based on similar characteristics. The best model explaining roost selection by all bats included tree and stand characteristics; landscape factors had little influence on roost use. Bats selected large diameter trees in areas with a high density of trees with cavities in the surrounding area. Most roosts (67.4%) were in water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) in semi-permanently flooded and saturated areas. Half of maternity roost cavities had upper bole openings whereas only 25.8% of solitary roosts had upper bole openings. Bats that roosted with maternity groups stayed in roosts for significantly shorter periods of time (1.3 ± 0.1 days) and used significantly more roost trees (5.0 ± 0.6 roosts) than adult males (3.8 ± 1.10 days, 2.3 ± 0.4 roosts, respectively). Maternity colony use of cavities with upper bole openings and shorter residency times suggest that predator avoidance may have been an important factor governing roosting behavior of maternity colonies in this area. Our results suggest that retention of large diameter, hollow trees in wetland areas will benefit Rafinesque’s big-eared bat individuals and maternity colonies in this area.",

Measurements were analysed by Chi-square, ANOVA, t-tests and regression to identify any relationship between the body mass index and the condition of canine and molar teeth, as well as in relation to sex and season.\nResults There was no statistically signiﬁcant relationship between a bat’s dentition state and the body mass index being used.\nConclusions In Townsville, the black ﬂying-fox appears to experience a rapid decline in dental condition over time. Despite this, there is little indication that loss of teeth results in a decline in body condition. We attribute this to the dominance of ﬂoral foods in the bats’ diet in Townsville and a lesser importance of hard fruit that requires intact dentition for consumption. Edentulousness on its own is not suﬃcient reason to euthanase black ﬂying-foxes in either Townsville or similar relatively dry localities where blossom dominates the ﬂying-fox diet.",

They have been used to investigate the physiological state and the adaptation of individuals to their habitat, changes in nutritional state of birds, body condition, the level of parasite infestation, male quality, the physical condition of nestlings, etc. In the present study we tested the role of haematological and plasma biochemistry values in burrowing parrots\n              Cyanoliseus patagonus\n              (Aves, Psittaciformes) for determining individual quality and condition. We measured triglyceride levels, plasma protein levels, plasma hue and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of nestlings and breeding adults in a colony in the north of Patagonia, Argentina. We found that plasma triglyceride levels strongly relate to changes in individual condition. Plasma levels of triglycerides were found to be strongly related to mass change, hatching order and brood size in nestlings. Levels of triglycerides were found to reflect reproductive effort in adults: males fledging larger broods had decreased levels of triglycerides. Adults with lower body condition had increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates. Plasma hue showed a strong relationship with an ornamental trait, the red abdominal patch of male adults, and with parameters of structural body size. Thus, we have shown that haematological and plasma biochemistry values, especially plasma levels of triglycerides, are good indicators of individual quality and condition in nestlings and breeding birds.",

Here we use morphology of echolocation calls to discriminate between Myotis spp. This method may be used to identify unknown roosts to species level. Echolocation calls of M. daubentonii, M. mystacinus and M. nattereri, were recorded in emergence flights from roosts. Images of echolocation calls were extracted for morphological analysis performed in SHAPE, a program that transforms two-dimensional outline data into Elliptic Fourier Descriptors. Species typical call shapes were described with Mahalanobis models. Discriminant Function Analyses (DFA) were applied with Mahalanobis scores of typical shape alone and with a spectral call parameter, maximum frequency. DFA achieved an overall correct classification rate of 88.9% using typical outline shapes alone. Correct classification of 100% of both M. daubentonii and M. mystacinus was achieved by both typical call outlines. For M. nattereri, 79.6% of calls were correctly classified by call morphology, but the addition of maximum frequency improved this to 96.3%. Shape analyses provide a quick and easy method of distinguishing Myotis species under field conditions and could be extended to include other species of bats that share conventional acoustic parameters.",

In this paper, the evaluation of habitat suitability of the Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) in the Wuling Mountains was studied. The global positioning system (GPS), remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) were used to obtain ground survey data and analyse the habitat factors driving the distribution of R. sinicus. The binary logistic regression model and the Maximum Entropy Model (MAXENT model) were used to analyse the habitat suitability of R. sinicus, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the models. The results showed that both models had high prediction accuracy, but the results of the MAXENT model were more stable than those of the binary logistic regression model when the sample size changed, indicating that the MAXENT model was the optimal method. Thena jack-knife test was used to determine the importance of the influencing factors. The results showed that the main factors influencing habitat selection were annual mean temperature, annual precipitation, the nearest distance from a settlement and vegetation fractional coverage (VFC). The suitable habitat was mainly distributed in the middle region of the study area. Marginally suitable habitat was located on the edge of suitable habitat, and unsuitable habitats were mainly distributed in the southern and northwestern regions.",

The Little Brown Bat (Myotis lucifugus) and Yuma Myotis (Myotis yumanensis) are sympatric in parts of their range in western North America, and they overlap in morphology, making them difficult to tell apart in the hand in some areas, such as the Pacific Northwest. We compared various methods of distinguishing between M. lucifugus and M. yumanensis to genetic results, using a blind test approach to remove observer bias. Using multiple independent observers, we used external morphology and echolocation-call structure to classify bats from a maternity colony consisting of both species. Genetic analysis confirmed 13 M. lucifugus and 40 M. yumanensis. Minimum echolocation-call frequency separated 100% of M. lucifugus from M. yumanensis using a cut-off of 43 kHz. All M. lucifugus had a minimum echolocation-call frequency #42.8 kHz, whereas M. yumanensis had a minimum frequency $44.55 kHz. There was some overlap in forearm length; a cut-off of 36 mm would have correctly identified 77% of M. lucifugus and 100% of M. yumanensis to species. Criteria based on subjective assessment of fur sheen and length as well as ear color were moderately successful (90.5 and 77% success by 2 separate observers) in distinguishing between the 2 species. The use of Munsell soil color charts and multivariate statistics to classify fur and membrane color and confirm species identification was not successful. Our results suggest that mean minimum call frequency alone is sufficient for distinguishing between M. lucifugus and M. yumanensis. Use of quantitative rather than qualitative criteria eliminates observer bias and appears to be better for identifying these 2 species.",

Whilst low severity fire has positive benefits for increased insectivorous bat activity and diversity, little information is available on the impact on rainforest specialised clutter dependant species such as the Golden-tipped Bat Phoniscus papuensis. Our aims were to assess the effects of fire on occupancy of habitat across the geographic range of P. papuensis in NSW, to determine the smaller scale effects of fire on use of diurnal roosts in rainforest through radio tracking and to trial the use of artificial structures to temporarily increase roost availability in burnt habitat. We observed that widespread fire encroaching on rainforest has a negative association with occupancy by P. papuensis, with this metric ~78% lower than in unburnt forest. In burnt areas, P. papuensis preferentially used unburnt refugia for their roosting sites in suspended bird nests and the loss of these habitat structures likely contributes to the disappearance of P. papuensis from the landscape. Artificial roosts were not used in the short-term (&lt; 2 years post fire) and do not appear to be a feasible management tool. With the increasing frequency and extent of wildfires the most important factor for P. papuensis to persist in the landscape into the future is the protection of its habitat through ensuring sensitive management of large tracts of connected rainforest to help buffer against the encroachment of future mega-fires.",

            "abstractNote": "The long-snouted bat (Platalina genovensium) is an endemic nectar-feeding bat from arid regions in western Peru and Chile. In certain areas of its distribution, it is likely the only bat pollinator and seed disperser of plants, and it is currently highly endangered. However, some aspects of its ecology, diet, and pollinator role remain unknown, especially in the unique and endangered lomas ecosystem. We conducted monthly evaluations of bats and plants over 15 months in the lomas of the National Reserve of Lachay (Peru) by sampling in three different plant communities along the Guayabito gorge. We collected fecal and pollen fur samples from 16 individuals of P. genovensium and recorded the phenology of its potential plant food resources. We differentiated fecal sample components and then identified and counted all pollen morphotypes in order to estimate their frequency and abundance in the samples. We also analyzed the niche breadth. Our results showed that the dietary components of P. genovensium included nectar, pollen, fruits, and insects, and that it utilized the cacti community for feeding. Pollen of the genus Haageocereus (Cactaceae) was the most frequent and abundant resource recorded, which was available all year long; moreover, the niche breadth analysis revealed that P. genovensium has a specialized diet on the Haageocereus cactus in Lachay. Finally, we suggest that P. genovensium could serve as a pollinator for Haageocereus acranthus, Haageocereus pseudomelanostele, and Puya ferruginea (Bromeliaceae) due to the large pollen loads it carries and the specific placement of pollen on different body zones.",

Allozyme variation revealed mean heterozygosity levels within islands of 0.047, which is near the mammalian average. However, heterozygosity tended to decline from west to east as populations approached the periphery of the species’ distribution, and was lowest in those islands that were separated by the greatest sea-crossing from source populations. There is extensive between-island genetic differentiation (mean FST = 0.40) and relationships between islands are associated with their arrangement in geographical space; genetic distance is correlated with geographical distance and the genetic arrangement of islands is associated with longitude. The arrangement of islands as indicated by variation in body and skull metrics is also associated with their geographical positions, and the metric and genetic measures are themselves associated. While other taxa in the region have shown genetic-geographical concordances, R. afﬁnis is the only one that displays concordant patterns in metrical features. These patterns in biological diversity are interpreted as arising from the sequential island population structure and clines in key biogeographic gradients.",

We identified various roosts used by R. ferrumequinum within the park and investigated their microclimatic parameters (temperature, relative humidity and daily temperature excursion). We monitored roost use for one year and found it not only to be influenced by season and the microclimatic conditions of different roosts, but also by occasional stress conditions such as disturbance by predators. We also studied nightly emergence behavior, specifically we considered how this is influenced by climatic (temperature, relative humidity and evening light intensity) and demographic (presence of pups, subadults and colony size) parameters. The colony always performed a pre-emergence behavior and we found that its onset occurred earlier at higher temperatures, lower evening light intensity, in larger colonies and in the presence of pups. High temperature and low evening light intensity also resulted in a longer nightly emergence, which was also identified in larger colonies and when subadults were present. This study highlights the importance of the conservation of multiple roosts within the distribution range of R. ferrumequinum nurseries. Additionally, we demonstrated how certain climatic and demographic factors influence both pre-emergence and emergence behavior.",

The mitochondrial genome is composed 22 tRNA genes, 13 protein-coding genes, and two rRNA genes. Molecular phylogeny of the order Chiroptera based on the maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference trees supports the classification of R. amplexicaudatus to genus Rousettus and family Pteropodidae. Furthermore, both trees support the modern division of order Chiroptera into the Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera clades.",

In addition, tree roosts were searched using ultrasound detectors at three sites. A total of 35 roosts in natural crevices were found using radio telemetry and through searches with ultrasound detectors and 31 of these roosts were in hollow trees, the majority in aspens Populus tremula L. (n = 30). Some tree roosts were even used by the northern bat Eptesicus nilssonii (Keyserling & Blasius 1839) which is considered a house-dwelling species in Norway. Aspens have some qualities preferred by bats and were both warmer and safer than other hollow tree species in this study area. Bat boxes are used as maternity roosts mainly by soprano pipistrelles at these latitudes, thus at present, there is no suitable alternative to hollow trees that would satisfy all tree-dwelling bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Many mammals hibernate during winter, reducing energy expenditure via bouts of torpor. The majority of a hibernator’s energy reserves are used to fuel brief, but costly, arousals from torpor. Although arousals likely serve multiple functions, an important one is to restore water stores depleted during torpor. Many hibernating bat species require high humidity, presumably to reduce torpid water loss, but big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) appear tolerant of a wide humidity range. We tested the hypothesis that hibernating female E. fuscus use behavioural flexibility during torpor and arousals to maintain water balance and reduce energy expenditure. We predicted: (1) E. fuscus hibernating in dry conditions would exhibit more compact huddles during torpor and drink more frequently than bats in high humidity conditions; and (2) the frequency and duration of torpor bouts and arousals, and thus total loss of body mass would not differ between bats in the two environments. We housed hibernating E. fuscus in temperature- and humidity-controlled incubators at 50% or 98% relative humidity (8°C, 110 days). Bats in the dry environment maintained a more compact huddle during torpor and drank more frequently during arousals. Bats in the two environments had a similar number of arousals, but arousal duration was shorter in the dry environment. However, total loss of body mass over hibernation did not differ between treatments, indicating that the two groups used similar amounts of energy. Our results suggest that behavioural flexibility allows hibernating E. fuscus to maintain water balance and reduce energy costs across a wide range of hibernation humidities.",

Bats of the genus Myotis include insectivorous, facultatively piscivorous, and piscivorous species. We tested the hypothesis that facultatively piscivorous (five Myotis species) and piscivorous species (M. vivesi) present cranial morphological and functional changes with respect to insectivorous taxa (16 Myotis species). Cranial shapes in skull and mandible modules were described with four geometric landmark configurations in these dietary groups. Gape capacity was measured with the stretch factors for temporal and masseter muscles. Geometric configurations from two skull and two mandible shapes were analyzed to detect differences in cranial morphology in relation to diet. Differences in cranial morphology were found between piscivorous and insectivorous species involving the mandibular process where masticatory muscles are attached. Linear regression analysis of Procrustes distances and gape capacity showed that the shape of the mandibular process region was highly correlated with the stretch factor of the masseter muscle in piscivorous and facultatively piscivorous species. These results suggest differences in cranial morphology and performance among diets but the hypothesis of gradual changes in cranial shape among diets was only accepted for the mandible and not for the skull. Myotis vivesi appears to improve mechanical advantage of masticatory muscles at lower gapes, presumably allowing more efficient chewing of slippery prey.",

            "abstractNote": "Introduction: Bats are a diverse group of mammals that have unique features allowing them to act as reservoir hosts for several zoonotic pathogens such as Leptospira. Leptospires have been classified into pathogenic, intermediate, and saprophytic groups and more recently into clades P1, P2, S1, and S2, being all the most important pathogenic species related to leptospirosis included within the P1/pathogenic clade. Leptospira has been detected from bats in several regions worldwide; however, the diversity of leptospires harboured by bats is still unknown. Aim: The aim of the present study was to determine the genetic diversity of Leptospira spp. harboured by bats worldwide.\nMethods: A systematic review was conducted on four databases to retrieve studies in which Leptospira was detected from bats. All studies were screened to retrieve all available Leptospira spp. 16S rRNA sequences from the GenBank database and data regarding their origin. Sequences obtained were compared with each other and reference sequences of Leptospira species and analysed through phylogenetic analysis.\nResults: A total of 418 Leptospira spp. 16S rRNA sequences isolated from 55 bat species from 14 countries were retrieved from 15 selected manuscripts. From these, 417 sequences clustered within the P1/pathogenic group, and only one sequence clustered within the P2/intermediate group. Six major clades of P1/pathogenic Leptospira spp. were identified, three of them composed exclusively of sequences obtained from bats.\nConclusion: We identified that bats harbour a great genetic diversity of Leptospira spp. that form part of the P1/pathogenic clade, some of which are closely related to leptospirosis-­associated species. This finding contributes to the knowledge of the diversity of leptospires hosted by bats worldwide and reinforces the role of bats as reservoirs of P1/pathogenic Leptospira spp.",

Using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), we provide molecular evidence for Pd on four big brown bats overwintering in heated buildings in New Brunswick, Canada. Two of the affected individuals also had very mild, focal, pustular, fungal dermatitis identified microscopically. A third bat, which was qPCR Pd-negative, had similar fungal lesions. Despite determining that these fungal lesions were caused by a suspected ascomycete, the intralesional fungi were not confirmed to be Pd. These findings demonstrate that bats overwintering in heated buildings and other above-ground sites may have subclinical or preclinical WNS, or be contaminated with Pd, and could play a role in local dispersal of Pd. Our inability to determine if the ascomycetes causing pustular lesions were Pd highlights the need for ancillary diagnostic tests, such as in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry, so that Pd can be detected directly within a lesion. As the host–pathogen relationship for Pd evolves, and where bat species are exposed to the fungus under varying temperature regimes, lesions may become less stereotypic and such tests could help define these changes.",

The nightly exodus of Chaerophon plicatus from this site is an economically valuable tourist attraction, and must impose significant controls on the regional ecology. Monitoring ecosystem health requires monitoring bat population size, but no quantitative assessments for the Gomantong colony are available in the literature. Traditional censusing techniques (based on packing density and roost area or on roost exodus counts) yield notoriously unreliable results. Here we have applied innovative image analysis and counting techniques to videographic, photographic and terrestrial laser scanning data obtained in July 2012. The colony exits in a consistent stream along a narrow exit trajectory. The laser scanning of the large cave entrance allowed precise measurement of bat position. Video data provided 0.02-second time resolution. Average flight speed was calculated (10.38 ± 0.85 m/sec), bat exit rate was estimated at three minute intervals (peaking at 14,000 bats/minute) and then summed over the 40 minutes of bat flight. The resultant colony size estimate of 275,625–276,939 (95% confidence interval) individuals of C. plicatus in Gomantong Caves in 2012 demonstrates that the technique is viable, provides a realistic basis for ecosystem management, and can be repeated to monitor ecosystem change. The estimated insect consumption by the colony of this size is 927 ± 191 metric tons of insects per year over an estimated 270 km2 area, a very important component in maintaining ecosystem stability in the Gomantong Forest Reserve and the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, as well as pest control over the large agricultural tracts of the region.",

Populations at high latitudes face four challenges: a shorter active season and shorter nights during the active season (less time to accumulate fat), a longer hibernation period (larger fat store needed), and colder nights (reduced prey availability). Mating also occurs during the prehibernation period, placing time constraints for mating and fattening on northern populations. We tested the hypothesis that these factors constrain prehibernation foraging in northern populations of little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte, 1831)). We measured plasma triglyceride concentration to study prehibernation fueling rates of a population near the northern range limit of the species and compared our results with previously published results from a more southern population. In contrast to bats at the lower latitude, we found consistently low concentrations of plasma triglycerides, indicating a low fuelling rate throughout the prehibernation p...",

The need for migratory stopover sites to rest and refuel, such as used by birds, has been repeatedly suggested, but not previously tested empirically in bats.\n            \n            \n              2.\n               We studied migrating silver‐haired bats (\n              Lasionycteris noctivagans\n              ) at Long Point, ON, Canada. We used digital radio‐transmitters to track 30 bats using an array of five towers that effectively covered the entire region (\n              c.\n              20 × 40 km). We measured stopover duration and departure direction, and documented movement patterns, foraging activity and roost sites. We measured body composition on arrival using quantitative magnetic resonance and simulated long‐distance migration using observed body composition to predict migration range and rate.\n            \n            \n              3.\n               Migration occurred in two waves (late August and mid‐September). Most bats stayed 1–2 days, although two remained >2 weeks. One third of the bats foraged while at the site, many foraging opportunistically on nights when rain precluded continued migration. Bats roosted in a variety of tree species and manmade structures in natural and developed areas. Half of the bats departed across Lake Erie (minimum crossing distance\n              c.\n              38 km) while half departed along the shoreline.\n            \n            \n              4.\n               Simulations predicted a migration rate of\n              c.\n              250–275 km per day and suggest that all but one of the bats in our study carried sufficient fuel stores to reach the putative wintering area (estimated distance 1500 km) without further refuelling.\n            \n            \n              5.\n               Our results suggest that migrating bats stopover for sanctuary or short‐term rest as opposed to extended rest and refuelling as in many songbirds. Daily torpor could reduce energy costs when not in flight, minimizing the need for extended stopovers and allowing bats to potentially complete their migration at a fraction of the time and energy cost of similar sized birds.",

We characterized levels of genetic diversity and population structure of the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte, 1831)) in eastern Canada to infer the extent to which oceanic straits may be barriers to movement. To quantify metrics of gene ﬂow and infer movement dynamics, we genotyped 679 M. lucifugus at nine nuclear microsatellites (nDNA) and sequenced a portion of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We found high levels of genetic diversity and little population structure, with ≈13-fold higher differentiation of mtDNA than nDNA markers, suggesting that structuring patterns largely result from female philopatry. Discriminant analysis of principle components suggested that the subtle underlying structure was not concordant with sampling site. Regional differentiation (FST, Dest, Mantel test residuals) is mostly consistent with genetic isolation by distance. However, samples from Newfoundland showed genetic differentiation over and above the effects of distance, lower levels of genetic diversity, and less genetic connectivity with other sampled regions. Despite this, oceanic straits in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence do not appear to create an impenetrable barrier to movement, therefore it may be possible for white-nose syndrome to spread to Newfoundland.",

The total haplotype and nucleotide diversity are 0.63 ± 0.055 and 0.0021 ± 0.00017, respectively which suggest that R. ferrumequinum exhibits low genetic diversity. AMOVA analysis shows that more variation of genetic differentiation is present among populations of phylogenetic groupings than within populations. Our phylogenetic results support the monophyly of R. ferrumequinum and suggest this taxon comprises three allopatric/parapatric phylogroups that are distributed in Europe-western Turkey, eastern Turkeynorthern Iran, and southern Iran. The Europe-western Turkey lineage (clade 2) split from the eastern Turkey-Iran lineage (clade 1) during the middle Pleistocene (0.8534 (ca.I)À0.6454 (ca.II) Ma). The divergence time among subclades A and B occurred during the mid-Pleistocene (0.4849 (ca.I)À0.369 (ca.II) Ma). All phylogenetic analyses also indicate that the Iranian and eastern Turkey R. ferrumequinum diverged from Europe and western Turkey R. ferrumequinum, with the mean percentage sequence differences ranging from 0.92%À0.75% between them. We infer that long-term isolation of R. ferrumequinum in spatially distinct refugia in parts of southwestern and northeastern Iran has promoted distinct phylogeographic lineages during the Pleistocene.",

Therefore, the application of geometric morphometric (GM) techniques could yield more refined and robust analyses of inter- and intraspecific variations. In this study, we generated two datasets: one with molecular delimitation data based on the barcode region (COI) and the other with cranial size and shape data using GM methods. Our aims were to investigate variations between large and small species within the genus Artibeus, as well as to explore potential factors influencing such variations. The results from species delimitation revealed molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) supporting the morphological identification. Analyses using GM techniques demonstrated significant inter- and intraspecific variations in cranial size and shape among Artibeus species. The combined outcomes suggest the absence of a significant phylogenetic signal influencing skull variation. This scenario indicates that potential historical ecological factors may have directly influenced the cranial morphology of these species, acting as significant selection forces in geographical space and generating intraspecific variations in Artibeus planirostris.",

Developing large numbers of markers has traditionally been technically difﬁcult, and this has limited our ability to investigate evolutionary phenomena that emerge across short temporal scales. Moreover, few markers tend to successfully amplify across species boundaries. As rapid advancements in high-throughput sequencing make microsatellite development cost- and time-effective, new avenues for evolutionary, population genetic and chromosome linkage mapping research are emerging. We used a published PERL script and second-generation sequencing to rapidly and affordably develop microsatellite loci for a widespread phyllostomid bat, Artibeus lituratus, for which no markers were previously available. We used Roche FLX (Titanium) Genome Sequencing to randomly sequence  101 Mb (255 065 unique reads) of genomic DNA for A. lituratus, within which we discovered 30 100 microsatellite loci. We designed primers for 19 395 loci that contained suitable ﬂanking regions. We ordered primers for 96 loci, 90 of which produced a single PCR product in A. lituratus. We genotyped 52 loci, and 45 were polymorphic in A. lituratus. We tested cross-species ampliﬁcation for 96 loci in six additional phyllostomid species: A. planirostris, A. ﬁmbriatus, A. phaeotis, Enchisthenes hartii, Sturnira lilium, and Carollia perspicillata. Cross-species ampliﬁcation was successful for at least one species for 87 loci (A. ﬁmbriatus), and in all species, at least 66 loci were ampliﬁed. These markers will not only facilitate future work on these seven species, but also illustrate the utility of this high-throughput method for development of primers across many species simultaneously.",

We investigated factors affecting foraging by Grey-headed Flyingfoxes (Pteropus poliocephalus; ‘ﬂying-foxes’) in the greater Melbourne metropolitan area. Flying-foxes established a continuously occupied colony site in the Royal Botanic Gardens Melbourne in 1986, and the size of the colony has subsequently increased greatly. We used a stratiﬁed-random sampling design to examine the importance of six variables on the detection of foraging ﬂying-foxes: (i) distance from the colony site (0–10, 10–20 and 20–30 km); (ii) distance from the Yarra River (0–5 and 5–20 km); (iii) the relative tree density of the municipality; (iv) whether the site was a park or street; (v) whether there was a relatively high or low density of trees at the site; and (vi) whether food was or was not detected at the site. We surveyed 240 sites within a 30-km radius of the colony site for foraging ﬂying-foxes in both May and October 2002. The probability of detecting a foraging ﬂying-fox declined with increasing distance from the colony site, but increased with increasing tree cover, and was higher for parks compared with streets and when food was present. Flying-foxes were observed foraging in a number of plant genera that have no species that naturally occur in the Melbourne area. Flying-foxes in Melbourne thus forage on planted resources that are widely distributed within a fragmented landscape, and are an example of a positive response by a native species to the process of urbanization.",

Domestic animals are commonly implicated as reservoirs of\n              S. enterica\n              and\n              C. jejuni\n              , but both are also detected in wild animals.\n              Salmonella enterica\n              serovar Typhimurium is the most common cause of human salmonellosis in Australia; however,\n              Salmonella enterica\n              serovar Wangata is associated with sporadic human outbreaks in New South Wales and wild animals may be a potential reservoir. To determine if wild grey‐headed flying foxes (GHFF;\n              Pteropus poliocephalus\n              ) are reservoirs of\n              Salmonella\n              and\n              Campylobacter\n              , faecal samples were collected from three GHFF colonies in New South Wales and cultured for the presence of\n              Salmonella\n              and\n              Campylobacter\n              . One\n              Salmonella\n              isolate was cultured from 254 GHFF faecal samples (0.39%). Whole genome sequencing was used to genetically characterise the\n              Salmonella\n              isolate and perform phylogenetic analysis. The GHFF isolate was determined to be\n              Salmonella\n              Typhimurium ST19. The GHFF isolate carried a virulence plasmid and other virulence factors, but did not exhibit antimicrobial resistance. Phylogenetic analysis determined that the GHFF isolate was most closely related to a cluster of six isolates: four from human salmonellosis cases in Queensland and two from Australian livestock. Neither\n              Campylobacter\n              nor\n              Salmonella\n              Wangata were cultured from the 254 GHFF faecal samples. This study concluded that wild GHFF in New South Wales are not major reservoirs for\n              Salmonella\n              , and the zoonotic risks associated with\n              S. enterica\n              carriage by urban GHFF are low for the general public.",

Manual stimulation resulted in the successful collection of motile spermatozoa on 17 of 34 attempts. The semen had a pH of 8.2 (\n              n\n              =2). With the exception of volume, seminal characteristics (concentration, motility, acrosome and plasma membrane status) were similar to those collected previously by electro‐ejaculation.

            "abstractNote": "Mammalian sperm capacitation involves biochemical and physiological changes, such as an increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+]i), hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane potential and sperm hyperactivation, among others. These changes provide sperm with the ability to fertilize. In the bat Corynorhinus mexicanus, there is an asynchrony between spermatogenesis and sperm storage in the male with the receptivity of the female. For instance, in C. mexicanus, spermatogenesis occurs before the reproductive season. During the reproductive period, sperm are stored in the epididymis for a few months and the testis undergoes a regression, indicating low or almost null sperm production. Therefore, it is unclear whether the elements necessary for sperm fertilization success undergo maturation or preparation during epididymis storage. Here, we characterized pH-sensitive motility hyperactivation and Ca2+ influx in sperm, regulated by alkalinization and progesterone. In addition, by electrophysiological recordings, we registered currents that were stimulated by alkalinization and inhibited by RU1968 (a CatSperspecific inhibitor), strongly suggesting that these currents were evoked via CatSper, a sperm Ca2+-specific channel indispensable for mammalian fertilization. We also found hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, such as in other mammalian species, which increased according to the month of capture, reaching the biggest hyperpolarization during the mating season. In conclusion, our results suggest that C. mexicanus sperm have functional CatSper and undergo a capacitation-like process such as in other mammals, particularly Ca2+ influx and membrane potential hyperpolarization.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Increased cattle ranching in Neotropical landscapes has led to human–wildlife conflicts that complicate the relationship between agricultural production and biodiversity conservation. We review the literature related to conflicts between livestock production and the common vampire bat\n              Desmodus rotundus\n              , specifically, the factors that influence the incidence of problems caused by bites to cattle. We summarise the strategies proposed to reduce these problems and propose actions from the perspectives of cattle management, landscape ecology and the biology of the common vampire bat. The literature shows that free‐range extensive management systems, where cattle graze in areas with forest cover, near riparian zones, caves, secondary vegetation (generally shrublands and immature trees), and vegetation fragments and edges, increase the implications and the severity of the conflict. As a result of different selection forces, the wing morphology and echolocation characteristics of the common vampire bat facilitate its movement under these landscape conditions, thus favouring a scenario of greater interaction with cattle. We propose the establishment of a ‘buffer zone’ to separate the cattle as far as possible (at least 1 km) from the elements of the landscape that are key for the movement patterns of common vampire bats in cattle ranching areas. The feeding events of this species are positively associated with host availability and landscape elements that provide habitat and connectivity, which shows that the cause of this conflict originates from the process of cattle production and the invasion of the habitat of the common vampire bat. Anti‐rabies vaccination programmes in cattle and forest–cattle separation are the most important strategies to minimise conflict and prevent rabies outbreaks.\n            \n          , \n            RESUMEN EN ESPAÑOL\n            \n              El aumento de la ganadería en paisajes neotropicales ha llevado a conflictos entre humanos y vida silvestre, que complican la relación entre la producción agropecuaria y la conservación de la biodiversidad. Revisamos la literatura relacionada con los conflictos entre la producción ganadera y el murciélago vampiro común\n              Desmodus rotundus\n              , específicamente, los factores que influyen en la incidencia de los problemas causados por las mordeduras al ganado. Resumimos las estrategias propuestas para reducir estos problemas y proponemos acciones desde las perspectivas del manejo del ganado, la ecología del paisaje y la biología del murciélago vampiro común. La literatura muestra que los sistemas de manejo extensivo, donde el ganado pasta en áreas con cobertura forestal, cerca de zonas ribereñas, cuevas, vegetación secundaria, fragmentos y bordes de vegetación, aumentan las implicaciones y la severidad del conflicto. Como resultado de diferentes fuerzas de selección, la morfología alar y las características de ecolocalización del murciélago vampiro común facilitan su movimiento en estas condiciones del paisaje, favoreciendo así un escenario de mayor interacción con el ganado. Proponemos el establecimiento de una ‘zona de amortiguamiento’ para separar el ganado lo más lejos posible (al menos 1 km) de los elementos del paisaje que son clave para el patrón de movimiento del murciélago vampiro común en áreas ganaderas. Los eventos de alimentación de esta especie se asocian positivamente con la disponibilidad de hospederos y elementos del paisaje que brindan hábitat y conectividad, lo que demuestra que la causa de este conflicto se origina en el proceso de producción ganadera y la invasión del hábitat del murciélago vampiro común. Los programas de vacunación antirrábica en el ganado bovino y la separación entre el bosque y el ganado son las estrategias más importantes para minimizar los conflictos y prevenir los brotes de rabia.",

We hypothesized that tooth wear reduces the ability to consume hard-bodied insects, such as beetles, and that older E. fuscus (those with worn canines) would thus include fewer beetles in their diet than younger individuals (those with less-worn canines) do. We examined 600 fecal pellets collected from 60 female bats captured at a single maternity colony in southeastern Alberta, Canada. The diets of two groups were similar in composition, despite considerable differences in canine wear. Diets were dominated by beetles (Coleoptera), which accounted for 30 to 40% of the identifiable food items. Younger bats included more beetles in their diet, although the difference was not statistically significant. The results suggest that older bats are still able to use their worn canines to effectively puncture hard exoskeleton, perhaps because of the angular shape of the worn teeth.",

To test the hypothesis that postemergent WNS-infected bats recover from infection with G. destructans, 30 little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) were collected in May 2009 from a WNS-affected hibernation site in New Jersey. All bats were confirmed to be infected with G. destructans using a noninvasive fungal tape method to identify the conidia of G. destructans and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The bats were then held in captivity and given supportive care for 70 days. Of the 26 bats that survived and were humanely killed after 70 days, 25 showed significant improvement in the external appearance of wing membranes, had no microscopic evidence of infection by G. destructans, and had wing tissue samples that were negative for G. destructans by PCR. A subset of the bats was treated topically at the beginning of the rehabilitation study with a dilute vinegar solution, but treatment with vinegar provided no added advantage to recovery. Provision of supportive care to homeothermic bats was sufficient for full recovery from WNS. One bat at day 70 still had both gross pathology and microscopic evidence of WNS in wing membranes and was PCR-positive for G. destructans. Dense aggregates of neutrophils surrounded the hyphae that remained in the wing membrane of this bat.",

            "abstractNote": "The emergence of several bat coronavirus-related disease outbreaks in human and domestic animals has fueled surveillance of coronaviruses in bats worldwide. However, little is known about how these viruses interact with their natural hosts. We demonstrate a Betacoronavirus (subgenus Merbecovirus), PN-bCoV, in the intestine of its natural host, Nathusius’s Pipistrelle Bat (Pipistrellus nathusii), by combining molecular and microscopy techniques. Eighty-eight P. nathusii bat carcasses were tested for PN-bCoV RNA by RT-qPCR, of which 25 bats (28%) tested positive. PN-bCoV RNA was more often detected in samples of the intestinal tract than in other sample types. In addition, viral RNA loads were higher in intestinal samples compared to other sample types, both on average and in each individual bat. In one bat, we demonstrated Merbecovirus antigen and PN-bCoV RNA expression in intestinal epithelium and the underlying connective tissue using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. These results indicate that PN-bCoV has a tropism for the intestinal epithelium of its natural host, Nathusius’s Pipistrelle Bat, and imply that the fecal-oral route is a possible route of transmission.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the stages that compose the SEC of the bat Sturnira lilium, including evaluation of the average frequency of each of these stages throughout the year and calculation of the duration of the spermatogenic process. An ultrastructural characterization of the formation of the acrosomal cap was also performed. Testicular fragments were processed for morphological and immunohistochemical analysis as well as ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy. According to the tubular morphology method, the SEC in S. lilium is divided into eight stages, following the pattern found in other mammals. Primary spermatocytes were found at zygotene in stage 1 of the cycle. There was no variation in frequency of each of the stages over the seasons, with stage 1 being the most frequent, and stage 7 the least frequent. The duration of one seminiferous epithelium cycle was 3.45 days, and approximately 15.52 days were required for the development of sperm from spermatogonia. Ultrastructural characterization allowed the formation of the acrosomal cap in round spermatids to be monitored. In conclusion, the stages that compose the SEC in S. lilium are generally similar to those described for other mammals, but the duration of the spermatogenic process is shorter than previously recorded for mammals. The presence of primary spermatocytes at zygotene in stage 1 of the cycle is probably due to the longer duration of this stage.",

Testicular histological sections were evaluated using light and electron microscopy. The intertubular compartment occupied an average 10% of the testes, being predominately constituted of Leydig cells (LC). The percentages of the testes occupied by the intertubular compartment and by LC were signiﬁcantly higher in summer, while the other intertubular components did not vary signiﬁcantly among the seasons. As suspected under light microscopy, the ultrastructural analysis conﬁrmed the existence of multinucleated LC during winter. The increase in the nuclear percentage of LC in winter seems to have caused the decrease of the cytoplasmatic measurements in that season, as well as in the volume of LC. The highest cytoplasmatic values and volume of LC registered in the spring, summer, and fall can be related to greater activity of this cell in these seasons. The higher investment in intertubular tissue and in LC observed in summer, compared to winter; suggest an increase in the steroidogenic capacity of this bat during summer. The analyses correlating testicular morphometry and abiotic environmental factors in this study conﬁrm the inﬂuence of climatic factors on the reproduction of M. molossus. Microsc. Res.

            "abstractNote": "Recent ecological theories propose that species reach their highest abundance and genetic diversity in the center of their ecological niche and decline toward the edges. We assessed whether Lyle's ﬂying fox, Pteropus lylei, abundance and genetic diversity were correlated with niche centroid distance using an ecological niche model as a proxy for fundamental niche (NF). Alternatively, we assessed whether P. lylei abundance and genetic diversity were correlated with ﬁne-scale environmental factors as a proxy of the species’ realized niche (NR). We examined relationships between abundance and environmental factors at coarse and ﬁne scales as proxies of NF and NR, respectively. For coarse scale, ecological niche of P. lylei was modeled using all available occurrence records in Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, coupled with climatic data. We conducted ﬁeld measurements of P. lylei abundance and used genetic structure data across a large portion of the species’ range. We measured Euclidean distances between abundance and genetic data and the niche centroid in environmental dimensions. Spearman’s correlation was estimated between abundance and genetic diversity vs. distance to the niche centroid. Complementarily, for the ﬁne-scale test, we measured multiple regression models between abundance and genetic diversity versus the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), local temperature, percent area of waterbodies, human density, and number of Buddhist temples. We failed to detect relationships between abundance and genetic diversity with the distance to the niche centroid in the coarse-scale model. When using the ﬁne-scale, landscape-level data, we found negative correlation between genetic diversity and number of temples. The data available were unable to support niche centroid hypothesis for the current distribution and abundances of P. lylei. We note that our failure to ﬁnd an association does not support nor reject the niche centroid hypothesis. Instead, our capacity to test the niche centroid hypothesis may be limited by our ability to use empirical data to accurately reconstruct NF from ﬁeld observations only. Future research may require physiology-based experimental approaches to explore relationships between species abundances and the niche structure.",

            "abstractNote": "Parasitic infection risks in domestic animals may increase as a result of outdoor activities, often leading to transmission events to and from owners, other domestic animals and wildlife. Furthermore, outdoor access has not been quantified in domestic animals as a risk factor with respect to latitude or parasite transmission pathway. Cats are an ideal model to test parasitic infection risk in outdoor animals because there have been many studies analysing this risk factor in this species; and there is a useful dichotomy in cat ownership between indoor-only cats and those with outdoor access. Thus, we used meta-analysis to determine whether outdoor access is a significant risk factor for parasitic infection in domestic pet cats across 19 different pathogens including many relevant to human, domestic animal and wildlife health, such as\n              Toxoplasma gondii\n              and\n              Toxocara cati\n              . Cats with outdoor access were 2.77 times more likely to be infected with parasites than indoor-only cats. Furthermore, absolute latitude trended towards significance such that each degree increase in absolute latitude increased infection likelihood by 4%. Thus, restricting outdoor access can reduce the risk of parasitic infection in cats and reduce the risk of zoonotic parasite transmission, spillover to sympatric wildlife and negative impacts on feline health.",

However, the effects of bats on seed germination have been scarcely addressed. Here, we evaluate effects of passage of seeds through guts of Artibeus lituratus bats on the germination of the pioneer tree Cecropia pachystachya, accounting for seed storage time and fruit maturity as covariates. To control for seed sources, we collected infructescences and offered them partially to captive bats in order to obtain seeds passed through bats and seeds unpassed from the same infructescences. We then stored in glycerol subsets of seeds of both treatments through time until the beginning of the germination experiment. Germination success responded to storage time and fruit maturation stage. Among seeds from unripe fruits, those passed through the bat guts showed higher percentage of germination than seeds unpassed, but no difference occurred between treatments for seeds from mature fruits. In addition, passage through bats positively affected germination speed, irrespective of fruit maturity. Overall results support that bats can promote germination of C. pachystachya seeds, in addition to seed dispersal.",

The new species is included in Torrestrongylus because it features a bursa of the type 3 – 2, a divided cephalic vesicle with an anterior half in the shape of an umbrella, and a posterior widened half. The new species can be distinguished from the only other congener T. torrei Pérez-Vigueras, 1935 by four key features: ﬁrst, by the absence of cervical alae in both males and females; second, by the relatively longer second half of the cephalic cap; third, by the conﬁguration of the dorsal ray, that does not have a medial terminal ray, and ﬁnally, by the structure of the spicules. This is the second species in the genus, previously known from bats of the families Phyllostomidae and Molossidae in Cuba, and now in Mexico.",

Echolocating bats have retinae dominated by rod photoreceptors and use dim light vision for navigation, and in rare cases for hunting. However, the visual detection threshold of insectivorous echolocating bats remains unknown. Here, we determined this threshold for the vespertilionid bat Myotis daubentonii. We show that for a green luminous target, M. daubentonii has a visual luminance threshold of 3.2(±0.9)×10−4 cd m−2, an intensity corresponding to the luminance of an open cloudless terrestrial habitat on a starlit night. Our results show that echolocating bats have good visual sensitivity, allowing them to see during their active periods. Together with previous results showing that M. daubentonii has poor visual acuity (∼0.6 cycles deg−1), this suggests that echolocating bats do not use vision to hunt but rather to orient themselves.",

            "abstractNote": "The ﬂoral biology and pollination ecology of durian, Durio zibethinus, were determined in eight semi-wild trees in mixed-fruit orchards in southern Thailand during April-May 2003 and 2005. Flowers open fully at 16h00–16h30 and most androecia drop around 01h00. Anthers dehisce at 19h30–20h00 when the stigmata are already receptive. In a series of pollination experiments, fruit was set in all treatments within 10 d. The greatest pollination success occurred after hand-crossed (76.6%), open (54.4%) and emasculation pollination (53.3%). Consistently, hand-crossed (12.2%), emasculation (8.7%) and open pollination (5.1%) yielded a substantial fruit set 2 mo after the pollination experiments. Very low pollination success in facilitated autogamy suggests that most durian trees are highly self incompatible. No mature fruit was found after insect pollination and automatic autogamy. Fruit bats, especially Eonycteris spelaea, are the major pollinators of this durian although the giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) was the most frequent visitor to the ﬂowers. Bats visited durian ﬂowers at the rate of 26.1 (SD = 20.7) visits per inﬂorescence per night. Since this semi-wild durian depends on fruit bats as its pollinator, protecting fruit bat populations and their roosts is vital for the production of the durian fruit crop.",
