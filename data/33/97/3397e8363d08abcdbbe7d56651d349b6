Common phylogenetic history among species, however, may also significantly influence these characters and obscure or enhance perceived patterns of plant syndromes. We analyzed the proportions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose by paper chromatography in the nectar and fruit juice of 525 tropical and subtropical plant species to test whether sugar chemistry was correlated with volant vertebrate pollinator or fruit disperser classes. Samples were taken from Old World and New World species and the calculations kept separate. Kruskal‐Wallis tests of family means showed significant deviations in the percent sucrose content among pollinatorl disperser classes. Mann‐Whitney\n              U\n              ‐tests showed significant differences among nectars of all pollinator classes but fruit juices differed only due to the high sucrose content of megachiropteran dispersed fruits. In addition, sign tests of samples occurring within families showed significant correlations between percentage sucrose content and pollinator/disperser classes. Passerine nectars had low sucrose content. In striking contrast, the nectar of hummingbird flowers had very high sucrose content. The Microchiroptera nectars showed hexose richness with a sucrose content somewhat greater than that of passerine flowers. Megachiroptera flowers showed sucrose‐rich nectars. The results for fruits were comparable to those for nectars. Passerine fruits were hexose dominated, microchiropteran fruits had a sucrose content similar to passerine fruits, and megachiropteran fruits were sucrose‐rich. We speculate on the evolutionary sequence of changes in nectar and fruit juice sugar composition and suggest that future investigations consider the chemistry of other food sources such as pollen and leaves. Only with these additions and other ecological studies can the full interplay of such plant‐animal interactions be anticipated.",

In order to learn about the current native mammals from the state, available literature of mammal records in the state was reviewed, finding that most studies have been carried out in the last 60 years. Ten orders, 29 families (72.5% national wide), 105 genera (58.01%), and 154 species (28.79%), including 50 monotypic and 104 politypic; 35 species are endemics to the country and three to the state. The most diverse orders are Chiroptera (66 species), Rodentia (36), Carnivora (20), and Cetacea (17); 31 taxa were described based on specimens collected in the state. In regard to the species distributional affinities, most terrestrial are Mesoamerican (70), then Neotropical (36) and Nearctic (31), while for the Order Cetacea there are 13 Tropical and four Antitropical. There are at least 40 species recorded on national or international conservation lists. Only one species has reduced its distribution or has been extirpated from the state and, two species of pinnipeds have been registered only once, in this paper we have considered them as outliers.",

We identify eight species of bat. Carollia perspicillata was the species with more capture frequency. The sound record allows us to identify to Pteronotus mesoamericanus. Many of the species found in the area are of vital importance to the functioning of the dry forest. They fulfill the roles of seed dispersers and pest controllers.",

Available literature was reviewed to evaluate the mammals known from that state. Eight orders, 24 families, 64 genera, and 106 species are currently known for the state, with 19 endemic species for the country and one of these for the state. Most diverse orders are Rodentia (47 species), Chiroptera (28), and Carnivora (17), similar to the World trend; there are 41 taxa described based on specimens collected at the state. Regarding the species distribution, most of the species have Nearctic affinities (85), rather than Mesoamerican (12) or Neotropical (9). Eighteen species are listed within either national or international conservation lists. We have considered five species disappeared or extirpated, while only two of these have been reintroduced in the state.",

An interesting evolutionary and colonization history has accommodated a current diversity of 51 species of wild mammals on the island representing 26% of the country’s continental mammals, including two introduced species with wild populations. The 78.4% are micromammals (bats and rodents) just as there is no evidence of large predators or species with large habitat requirements. It was also formalized the presence of six species on the island. These are: Lampronycteris brachyotis, Lonchorhina aurita, Micronycteris microtis, Trinycteris nicefori, Chrotopterus auritus and Natalus mexicanus, which, although included in technical reports, were not supported by any scientific publication.

In this period 110 species have been registered in the country. In total, we collect and analyze 93 scientific publications, which we order according to their publication date. All publications were made by foreigners until the end of the last century. In the last two decades, however, there has been an important contribution from national researchers. The period can be divided into four seccions, which boom has depended on the socio-political situations of the country. The first period covered the 19th century. The second and third the first and second half of the 20th century, respectively. Finally the fourth covered throughout this century. In the work we highlight the most important contributions to the study of the bats of Nicaragua from national and foreign naturalists and scientists. In this sense, this work is the first compilation of the historical contributions of the study of bats in the country.",

Initially, 26 species of microbats were reported, and no comprehensive study has been undertaken since 1991. The advent of genetic molecular studies has revealed some species to be the same (Pipistrellus deserti and Pipistrellus kuhlii) while others have had their nomenclature changed (Eptisecus isabellinus instead of Eptisecus serotinus, Plecotus gaisleri instead of Plecotus austriacus, Rhinopoma cystops instead of Rhinopoma hardwickei). Miniopterus schreibersii is now classified in the new family of Miniopteridae. These changes have corrected the number of Algerian bat species to 25, belonging to seven different families. All species are threatened globally and are protected at the national level by Decree 12-135.",

Negative interactions, commonly termed human-wildlife conflict (HWC), have increased in recent decades due to a number of factors including difficulties in identifying and communicating the complexities of stakeholder values and positions over wildlife and its management. Here, we present the perceptions of two conservation organizations on the landscape of HWC involving the threatened Mauritius Fruit Bat Pteropus niger, Kerr 1792 in Mauritius, including damage to fruit crops and controversial government culls in 2015 and 2016. Participants identified 18 stakeholders in the conflict varying in importance and influence, examined where and how hostility is manifested, and delineated both perceived and real costs of the conflict. Additionally, 13 environmental and 17 social risk factors associated with the conflict were categorized, along with potential policy and management options for mitigation. We argue that initial in-house workshops are advantageous in understanding conservation conflicts before extending dialogue with other stakeholders.",

With 504 species, Mexico has one of the most diverse mammalian faunas of the world, second only to Indonesia in terms of number of species. There are 147 endemic species and the rest are a combination of species of Nearctic and Neotropical affinities in similar proportions. The conservation status of species indicates that there are severe environmental problems, because eight species have disappeared in the last century, and 202 are classified in one of the categories of conservation concern. Finally, there are three introduced species that have become established in the country.",

Available literature was reviewed in regard to both, the terrestrial and the marine mammals, known from state of Nayarit, Mexico. Thirteen orders, 30 families, 88 genera, and 143 species are currently known for the state, with 32 endemic species for the country and 6 at state level. Most diverse orders are Chiroptera (61 species), Rodentia (33), Cetacea (20), and Carnivora (17); with 31 taxa described based on specimens collected at the state. It is noteworthy that bat species almost duplicate the number of rodent species, while both at international and national level, rodents are the most abundant. Regarding the species distribution, most of them have Mesoamerican affinities (53), rather than Nearctic (41) or Neotropical (29). Forty-one species are listed within either national or international conservation lists, including the 21 marine species.",

As for most model-ﬁtting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both ﬁxed- and random-eﬀects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the proﬁled deviance or the proﬁled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the proﬁled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Suﬃcient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to ﬁt specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.",

However, there is a lack of understanding regarding where and what this overlap is. Variation in the morphology of Carollia should correspond to the environment, yet such patterns remain unknown. Species may coexist as a function of environmental factors and sympatry may not be uniform along the distributional extent of these species. An informed perception of the morphological and ecological variation across their geographic range may clarify not only the limits and extents of their spatial and morphological boundaries, but also may provide insights into the relationships among size, shape and environment. In our quantitative analysis of the variation in morphology and environment we tried to answer what limits species distribution, as well as how morphology changes with the environment within and among species. A combination of multivariate contrasts and partial least square analyses were used to assess the correlations and interactions between size, shape, distribution and environment among C. castanea (small), C. brevicauda (medium) and C. perspicillata (large size) in Ecuador. We show how the three Carollia species vary and differentiate along an ecomorphological space of gradients, barriers, size and shape. From a macroecological perspective, and contrary to the theory of limiting similarity, the smallest species is the most distinct in its environmental space and also the one that experiences the strongest changes in shape across geographic regions. The other two more similar species, in both size and shape, show a larger overlap in their environmental space. This seems to suggest that size can act as a buffer in extreme or changing environments and that higher gene flow is more probable for larger high-altitude species.",

The factors affecting geographic evolution in acoustic signals remain poorly understood, especially in the contexts of high gene ﬂow. This study investigated variation patterns in peak frequency emitted by the Chinese endemic Myotis davidii on a broad geographic scale by evaluating the relative importance of morphological, environmental, geographic, and genetic variables. Signiﬁcant variation in peak frequency was observed among regions, but peak frequencies among populations within region had some percentage of similarity. Differences in peak frequency were not associated with morphological difference, genetic structure, and geographic distance among regions, which suggested that peak frequency divergences in M. davidii were not the primary driver of regions’ isolation in a context of weak gene ﬂow. Within the Middle East Plain (MEP), one of the regions delineated in this study, peak frequency differences of M. davidii were not signiﬁcantly correlated with genetic distance and geographic distance among populations, suggesting that peak frequency was not be subject to cultural drift within MEP. Our results provide evidence that geographic variation in echolocation call design may evolve as a consequence of local adaptation to climate conditions.",

The description is based on specimens removed from the small intestine of ghost-faced bats, Mormoops megalophylla, from central Mexico. The monotypic genus is unique in featuring sexual dimorphism on the cuticular ornamentation, which consists of the presence of spines on the anterior quarter of females, and of the presence of rugosities on the surface of the cephalic vesicle of males. The cuticular spines are arranged in spiral rings on the anterior quarter of the body, and there is no trace of said structures on the cuticle of males. The synlophe of the males possess 12 ridges, whereas there is no synlophe in females. Finally, females show a prominent caudal terminus (spine) and 3 subterminal tubercles, whereas males show bursal rays in a 3–2 arrangement, with a relatively prominent dorsal ray.",

The P. hastatus specimens presented 2n=32 chromosomes, including 13 biarmed autosome pairs and one acrocentric. The X chromosome is submetacentric and the Y is a minute acrocentric. A. lituratus has 2n=30 chromosomes in females and 31 in males specimens. The autosomes are 14 biarmed pairs and the chromosomal sexual system is XY1Y2 type, being the X chromosome a large submetacentric and both Y1 (real Y) and Y2 acrocentric elements. Several chromosomal homologies are shared between both taxa, including whole chromosomes and chromosomal arms. Based on similarity of G-banding pattern is proposed that the system XY1Y2 from A. lituratus risen by a tandem fusion event involving the stenodermatine original biarmed X chromosome with the autosome acrocentric homologous to Y2.",

            "abstractNote": "Previous studies have investigated rabies virus (RABV) epizootiology in Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) in natural cave roosts. However, little is known about geographic variation in RABV exposure, or if the use of man-made roosts by this species affects enzootic RABV infection dynamics within colonies. We sampled rabies viral neutralizing antibodies in bats at three bridge and three cave roosts at multiple time points during the reproductive season to investigate temporal and roost variation in RABV exposure. We report seropositive bats in all age and sex classes with minimal geographic variation in RABV seroprevalence among Brazilian free-tailed bat colonies in south-central Texas. While roost type was not a signiﬁcant predictor of RABV seroprevalence, it was signiﬁcantly associated with seasonal ﬂuctuations, suggesting patterns of exposure that differ between roosts. Temporal patterns suggest increased RABV seroprevalence after parturition in cave colonies, potentially related to an inﬂux of susceptible young, in contrast to more uniform seroprevalence in bridge colonies. This study highlights the importance of life history and roost ecology in understanding patterns of RABV seroprevalence in colonies of the Brazilian free-tailed bat.",

The proportion of infested female M. nattereri (54 %) is higher than that of infested males (17 %), which can be explained by the more gregarious behaviour of females. These proportions are almost similar during the bat’s mating season only (in autumn). The sex-ratio of the collected B. nattereri is balanced but female (resp. male) bat flies are more numerous on female (resp. male) bats. The existence of a physiological specificity is surmised to explain this unequal distribution. The low number of bat flies on each M. nattereri (1.7 B. nattereri per parasited host on average, 8 at the maximum) seems due to the relatively large size of the parasite.",

A high diversity of haemosporidian parasites has been described from bats, but our understanding of their prevalence, distribution and use of hosts remain fragmented. The haemosporidian parasites of bats in Cameroon have been largely understudied, but here, bats, sampled from different habitat types of the Central Region of Cameroon, were investigated for haemosporidian infections with a combination of microscopic and molecular phylogenetic analysis. An overall prevalence of 18.1% of haemosporidian infections was detected in a total of 155 investigated bats belonging to 14 bat species. For the first time Hepatocystis and Nycteria parasites were detected in bats from Cameroon and molecularly characterized. Hepatocystis infections were exclusively identified in the epauletted fruit bat host species Epomophorus pusillus with a high prevalence of 65.5%, whereas Nycteria infections could be detected in several hosts, namely: Doryrhina cyclops (60.0%), Rhinolophus landeri (20.0%) and one Nycteris grandis. This study unveils evidence that habitat types may play a role in transmission of Hepatocystis parasites on a local scale and it adds important information on the distribution and host specificity of the neglected haemosporidian genus Nycteria.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat species in the genus Pteropus (flying foxes) occur throughout most of Southeast Asia, but little is known about their distribution and patterns of local diversity across much of Indonesia. To help address this problem, a field survey of Pteropus species in Central and West Seram, Maluku Province, Indonesia, was conducted in 2012 and 2013. This study resulted in new records of rare Moluccan bats, including new locality records for four nearendemic species: P. chrysoproctus, P. melanopogon, P. ocularis, and P. temminckii. Together with data from additional specimens, these records provide new information about morphological variation in Moluccan Pteropus. High local diversity of large-bodied bats with restricted geographic ranges raises interesting questions about evolution in Pteropus and about ecological niche partitioning in Paleotropical pteropodid communities. More monitoring efforts in Maluku are needed, as the roosts located during the 2012–2013 survey are some of the only known sites where these species may be found, and none of these sites are located in protected areas. Without updated natural history data and taxonomic revision, proper management decisions cannot be made for any of these threatened species despite mounting anthropogenic pressure on their populations.",

In this study, we examined morphological and genetic data from different populations from Southeast Asia, with a special focus on specimens from Vietnam. Our analyses support the existence of a further species of Aselliscus in northeastern Vietnam that separated from A. stoliczkanus sensu lato (s.l.) during the late Miocene. Within the latter taxon, we identified five geographic lineages that diverged from each other during the Plio-Pleistocene epoch. Some of them may also correspond to further separate taxa, but additional molecular and morphological data are needed to test this hypothesis. Herewith, based on the combined evidences we describe the northeastern Vietnamese population as a separate species.",

Within Neotropical ecosystems, short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia: Phyllostomidae) are abundant nocturnal frugivores that rely primarily on Piper fruits as a food resource. Previous research has demonstrated that Carollia employs olfaction and echolocation to locate Piper fruit, but it is unknown how their sensory use and foraging decisions are influenced by the complex diversity of chemical cues that fruiting plants produce. Using free-ranging C. castanea and their preferred food, Piper sancti-felicis, we conducted behavioral experiments to test two main hypotheses: (1) foraging decisions in C. castanea are primarily driven by ripe fruit scent and secondarily by vegetation scent, and (2) C. castanea re-weights their sensory inputs to account for available environmental cues, with bats relying more heavily on echolocation in the absence of adequate scent cues. Our results suggest that C. castanea requires olfactory information and relies almost exclusively on ripe fruit scent to make foraging attempts. Piper sancti-felicis ripe fruit scent is chemically distinct from vegetation scent; it is dominated by 2-heptanol, which is absent from vegetation scent, and has a greater abundance of β-caryophyllene, β-ocimene, γ-elemene, and α-cubebene. Although variation in echolocation call parameters was independent of scent cue presence, bats emitted longer and more frequent echolocation calls in trials where fruit scent was absent. Altogether, these results highlight the adaptations and plasticity of the sensory system in neotropical fruit bats.",

Genus Rousettus have their morphological variances among its own species based on characteristics on each species. Among them there is fruit-feeding bats of from genus Rousettus (Chiroptera: Pteropodidae) that have many variances of morphology among its own species. This study was aimed to identify the morphological variations and its sex type influence of genus Rousettus bats from Gunung Duasudara Sanctuary, North Sulawesi. The locations were consisted 7 types of major vegetations at altitude range from 0 to 1351 m above sea level (asl). All habitat types were observed using Mist-net method at 1 and 3 m above the ground. There were found 452 individuals, including R. amplexicaudatus (224), R. celebensis (219) and R. tangkokoensis n. sp. (9). Nine individuals of Rousettus tangkokoensis n. sp. were newly found in lowland forest and coastal forest. These newly-found species were different from other Rousettus. There was discovered that sex type had influenced the skull and external body characters on R. amplexicaudatus, R. tangkokoensis n. sp. R. celebensis. However, most of other characters were statistically not-significant that indicated there was not any sexual dimorphism. According to the Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA), these morphological groups possess different specification. Therefore, the three species of genus Rousettus have statistically variation of skull and external body characters one to another.",

Four females were monitored for up to 7 d. Based on 575 radiotelemetry positions, kernel home ranges were between 36.5 and 90.7 ha. During each night, bats visited most of their home range, which included forest islands and continuous forest; however activity was concentrated in core-use areas representing 6–12 percent of the home ranges. There was moderate overlap in home range and core-use areas among the four females. The mean long axis across the kernel home ranges was 1324 m. The results reported here show that S. lilium is able to move freely among forest elements in the landscape while crossing a savanna matrix. Hence, S. lilium may contribute to maintain connectivity and ecological processes in a fragmented landscape.",

Our results detected no significant differences both in body mass and in forearm length between males and females at birth. On average, young bats were not agile fliers until 31 days of age. Body mass and forearm length of pups followed a linear pattern of growth until day 13, with mean growth rates of 0.17 g/day and 1.22 mm/day, respectively, and thereafter growth rates decreased. Length of the total epiphyseal gap of the fourth metacarpal-phalangeal joint showed a linear increase up to 10 days followed by a linear decrease until day 40 with a mean rate of 0.09 mm/day. Together, two equations permitted estimation of the age of R. marshalli pups between 1 and 40 days of age. Of the three nonlinear growth models (logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy), the logistic equation provided the best fit to the empirical curves for body mass and forearm length.",

Although many bat species use different habitats during the daytime and nighttime hours, these data are rarely collected simultaneously. We radio-tagged 48 adult Raﬁnesque’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus raﬁnesquii (Lesson, 1827)) in a bottomland hardwood forest in Kentucky from 2009 to 2011. We tracked bats to 64 day roosts over 549 bat-days and found bats roosted almost exclusively in trees located in forested wetlands (n = 59; 92%), and that reproductive females established their home ranges closest to these habitats (P < 0.0001). Although few (n = 4; 6%) roosts were located in deciduous forests on drier soils, these forests were important foraging habitats for pregnant females, which foraged closest to these habitats within their home ranges (P = 0.04). Abundance of Lepidoptera differed among habitats (P = 0.03), with higher abundance in deciduous forests and along forest–ﬁeld edges. Deciduous forests were the only habitat preferentially selected by any lepidopteran family (Notodontidae), and the only habitat not avoided by any family. These data conﬁrm the importance of forested wetlands to the ecology of Raﬁnesque’s big-eared bat and demonstrate the beneﬁt of proximally located deciduous forests that provide habitat for their moth prey.",

Most echolocation signals are characteristic for the subfamily (very high-frequency, broadband FM calls (sweeping down from178 kHz to 58 kHz) of low intensity and short duration « 3.0 msr), but this species also produces stereotypical calls of a markedly different structure. The arrangement of signal elements in these calls is unusual, and we present here a detailed analysis of calls from thirteen adult individuals (nine males and four females). These multiharmonic calls are of much lower frequency (fundamental peak frequency of 36 kHz), higher intensity and longer duration (12.0 ms) than the orientation calls, and are composites comprising a long quasi-constant frequency (QCF) syllable followed by an upward frequency modulated sweep (UFM). From considerations of signal design and preliminary field observations, we consider possible functions of these calls.",

In this study, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from a previous experiment in which KASV infection was confirmed in 18 experimentally infected ERBs were used for an in-depth analysis using histopathology, in situ hybridization (ISH) for detection of viral RNA, immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the mononuclear phagocyte system response, and quantitative digital image analysis to investigate virus clearance from the liver and spleen within a spatial context. Significant gross and histological lesions were limited to the liver, where KASV-infected bats developed mild to moderate, acute viral hepatitis, which was first observed at 3 days postinfection (DPI), peaked at 6 DPI, and was resolved by 20 DPI. A subset of bats had glycogen depletion (n = 10) and hepatic necrosis (n = 3), rarely with intralesional bacteria (n = 1). Virus replication was confirmed by ISH in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and tongue. In the liver, KASV replicated in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, to a lesser extent in mononuclear phagocytes, and rarely in presumptive endothelial cells. Most KASV RNA, as detected by ISH, was cleared from the spleen and liver by 6 DPI. It is concluded that ERBs have effective mechanisms to respond to this virus, clearing it without evidence of clinical disease.",

The size and morphological characteristics of the uterus were found to be highly relevant to mating and the delivery period. In particular, some of the sperm ejaculated to the female reproductive tract became extinct due to phagocytosis by leukocytes starting from the end of August, which continued until the end of February. Accordingly, this period may be called the cleansing period. The sperm became extinct mainly in the uterine lumen, and an extremely small amount of sperm became extinct by secretion from the uterine gland and the phagocytosis by leukocytes. Such phagocytosis seemed to result in maintaining the clean intrauterine environment to facilitate the implantation of the fertilized egg. Also, phagocytosis by leukocytes was considered as a physiological mechanism to kill the sperm breaking into the female reproductive tract by recognizing them as alien materials, to maintain an appropriate number of sperm at the fertilization site of the fallopian tubes, so as to improve fertility. Only the sperm reaching the caudal isthmus of oviduct were found to be involved in fertilization in the next year. Ovulation and fertilization occurred approximately at the end of March. Embryogenesis appeared consecutively with implantation. The pregnancy period was approximately 70 days; delivery occurred approximately early- and middle June; and the nurturing period was approximately 80 days.",

The purpose of our study was to analyse Plagiorchis spp. from European bats using a combination of morphological and molecular-phylogenetic approaches and to establish the taxonomic position of the problematic species P. mordovii. Plagiorchis spp. were shown to be variable morphologically and morphometrically both from various host species and from different specimens of the same species. We presented a new taxonomic key for identification of the Plagiorchis spp. from European bats, provided a complete description of Plagiorchis mordovii, and confirmed the validity and the generic affiliation of this species.",

We investigated the morphology of E. nilssonii blood cells during hibernation, hematological parameters including hemoglobin level, red blood cell (RBC) count, total white blood cell (WBC) count, and differential WBC count. The study revealed changes of several hematological parameters in hibernating bats, with some variation during the hibernation season. Hibernating E. nilssonii were found to have a low total WBC count similar to other hibernators; no significant variation in WBC count was noted during hibernation. Differential leukocyte count showed a significant reduction in total monocytes in winter (in the middle of the hibernation period). Total lymphocyte, band neutrophil, and basophil counts increased in spring (termination of the hibernation period).",

            "abstractNote": "Males of many vertebrate species aggressively defend their reproductive interests by monopolizing females, and the ‘challenge hypothesis’ predicts that testosterone levels in reproductive contexts rise to facilitate males' competitive behaviours necessary for meeting social challenges. The hypothesis is successful in explaining patterns of testosterone secretion in many avian species, but remains comparatively unexplored in mammals. ‘Circulating plasma testosterone levels (T)’ were studied in relation to harem maintenance in grey-headed flying-foxes,\n              Pteropus poliocephalus\n              . In this species, harems provide mating opportunities and so a male's ability to maintain a harem is likely to correlate with his fitness. We hypothesized that if T reflect a male's ability to withstand challenges from competitors, then T should be linked to successful harem maintenance. To test this, we temporarily removed males from their territories prior to and during the short mating period, recording their harem sizes both before removal and after reintroduction. Most males successfully reclaimed their territory and a harem, but during the mating period, males with higher T had harems closer to their original size, and males with lower T suffered reduction in harem size. Our findings highlight the role of T in harem maintenance in a major mammalian taxon with complex forms of social organization.",

            "abstractNote": "The reproductive beneﬁts of maintaining a high body temperature (Tb) are well understood, but costs may be prohibitively high. Many small mammals raise offspring in insulated nests, burrows, or roosts, and may form communal maternity colonies, all of which are behaviors that reduce the costs of maintaining Tb. However, some temperate-zone bats are solitary and raise young in exposed roosts. Little is known about how these species maintain energy balance in the face of high thermoregulatory costs, and whether they stay warm invariably for reproductive beneﬁts, or use a more adaptive thermoregulatory strategy. We studied Tb patterns in response to foraging conditions, weather, and pup age in free-ranging adult and juvenile hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus). Lactating females regularly entered torpor, although its use was most extensive following poor foraging conditions, during inclement weather, and when pups were young. Juvenile L. cinereus appeared capable of staying warm from 3 days of age, but used torpor throughout development, gradually decreasing its use as they grew. Our results indicate that for this species, torpor is important throughout lactation, and torpor use changes in response to individually speciﬁc trade-offs between energetic cost and developmental beneﬁt. We suggest that the costs of active thermoregulation during early development of L. cinereus pups outweigh the beneﬁts of staying warm, and an extended growing season (as a result of their migratory nature) is more conducive to using torpor. Finally, we suggest that torpor use during lactation is dynamic and adaptive. Fine-scale changes within reproductive stages need to be considered, rather than broadly assessing thermoregulatory behavior among stages.",

To clarify the population structure and migration pattern of M. macrodactylus, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeography was investigated in 15 subpopulations along three rivers (Tokachi, Ishikari and Teshio Rivers) on Hokkaido Island, northern Japan. Of 267 bats examined, nine mtDNA cytochrome b haplotypes were identified and separated into two major genetic clades, which did not reflect geographic distributions within and among the river regions. Principal component analysis of mtDNA haplotypes showed that most subpopulations in Ishikari and Teshio of the three river regions were grouped into one genetically related group, whereas those in the Tokachi river region were remotely related to those of the other two river regions. The results could be ascribed to no geographic barriers preventing bats’ migration between the former two river regions. By contrast, it is possible that the Daisetsuzan and Hidaka mountain ranges play a role as effective geographic barriers against migrations of this species between the Tokachi and Ishikari/Teshio river regions.",

            "abstractNote": "Mucuna macrocarpa is a plant found in tropical and subtropical regions that requires an “explosive opening.” Explosive opening is the process that exposes the stamen and pistil from the opening of the carina. This process is needed for cross pollination; however, the plant cannot open itself and opening by an animal is needed. The most common opener of Mucuna ﬂowers is several nectar-eating bats (e.g., Syconycteris), but the ﬂying fox, Pteropus dasymallus, is the only opener of M. macrocarpa on the subtropical island of Okinawajima. Here, we present the explosive openers and possible pollinators in the northernmost and temperate Kamae region, Kyushu, Japan, where nectar-eating bats are absent. The Japanese macaque, Macaca fuscata, and the Japanese marten, Martes melampus, were the explosive openers observed during our survey in Kamae. Martens opened ﬂowers using their snout in a manner similar to that of the ﬂying fox, whereas macaques opened ﬂowers using their hands. This is the ﬁrst time that an animal has been observed opening these ﬂowers with its hands rather than snout. In total, 97% (n = 283) of explosively opened ﬂowers were opened by macaques, and the macaque largely contributed to the overall ﬂower opening. Because many pollen grains become attached to the explosive openers, they are considered to be primary pollinators. Furthermore, two bee species, Apis cerana japonica and Bombus ardens ardens, also visited opened ﬂowers and collected pollen, and they were possibly secondary pollinators.",

C. plicatus has been recorded twice previously, in 1935 and 1997, but a roosting colony has not been recorded before. In May 2016, a colony containing about 300 C. plicatus was observed in a vertical cleft of the rock supporting Sigiriya fortress, a popular historical tourist destination. Four bats were captured during their evening emergence using mist nets. Recording of echolocation calls showed them to be similar to those previously documented for this species in being narrow bandwidth with shallow frequency modulation and low peak frequency (24.9–30.3 kHz), with average call duration of 7.7milliseconds (ms). The forearm length range (45.2–49.1 mm) of captured specimens corresponds to the specimen recorded in 1997 in Sri Lanka and with those recorded in Vietnam and Myanmar. The discovery of a colony of C. plicatus in Sri Lanka provides a basis for future studies of the biology and taxonomy of this species.",

This study focused on a stereotyped behavior of a bat approaching a companion animal in the colony, and examined their interaction and vocalization during this behavior. The bats emit echolocation-like vocalizations when approaching each other and these vocalizations contain a “buildup” pulse sequence, in which the frequency of the pulse increases gradually to normal echolocation pulse frequencies. The results suggest that the echolocation-like pulses serve an important role in communication within the colony.",

Insemination is probably effected several times during proestrous, since both sexes are intermittently active throughout this period (August‐April). Permanent arousal from torpor and return to normal metabolism in the spring results in ovulation. Both ovaries are functional and both uterine horns may be utilized.\n              P. hesperus\n              is monestrous; two young per bat is usual.\n            \n            The male spermatogenic cycle is initiated in late June and the first sperm are available for ejaculation in September. Some sperm remain in the seminiferous tubules until early March. The epididymides also serve in sperm storage with the caput emptied by late February and the cauda in April. Leydig cells are largely nonsecretory from March through July, a few are secretory in August and most are secretory in September and October. Active cells gradually decline in number until few are secretory in late March.\n            Accessory sex glands are functionally cyclic: they are small from April through August, hypertrophy in September, and gradually involute to the resting stage through March, to achieve total involution in April.\n            The penis, similar in structure to that of other vespertilionids, is thought specialized to insure effective insemination.",

For example, the influence of reproductive status, weather, and roost tree and surrounding habitat characteristics on timing of emergence, intra-night activity, and entrance at their roost trees is poorly known. We examined nocturnal activity patterns of northern myotis maternity colonies during pregnancy and lactation at diurnal roost trees situated in areas that were and were not subjected to recent prescribed fires at the Fernow Experimental Forest, West Virginia from 2007 to 2009. According to exit counts and acoustic data, northern myotis colony sizes were similar between reproductive periods and roost tree settings. However, intra-night activity patterns differed slightly between reproductive periods and roost trees in burned and non-burned areas. Weather variables poorly explained variation in activity patterns during pregnancy, but precipitation and temperature were negatively associated with activity patterns during lactation.",

            "abstractNote": "Crania and bacula of five taxa of small-footed bats of the leibii group, comprising two currently recognised species, Myotis californicus and M. leibii, were studied to elucidate their interrelationships. Canonical variate analysis of 14 cranial measurements shows the existence of three distinct nonoverlapping clusters corresponding to (i) M. californicus, (ii) M. I. ciliolabrum and M. I. melanorhinus, and (iii) M. I. leibii. The results of the morphometric analyses do not support the claim that M. I. leibii and M. I. melanorhinus intergrade in Oklahoma. The taxonomic interpretation of the results is that the western forms of M. leibii represent a separate species M. ciliolabrum (Mcrriam). The bacula of the taxa studied lack distinctive characters that would allow one to discriminate between the species of the leibii group.",

            "abstractNote": "Leptospirosis is a neglected zoonosis with a nearly global distribution. In order to determine the role of bats in the epidemiology of leptospirosis in Nigeria, a total of 231 bats belonging to three families, Pteropodidae (n = 117), Molossidae (n = 107) and Nycteridae (n = 17), roosting in human habitats were screened by PCR and sequencing for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira species. DNA extracted from the kidneys of bats were subjected to conventional PCR targeting the rrs1, rrs2, flaB and secY genes for the detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. Overall, 27 out of the 231 (11.7%) of the samples screened were positive for Leptospira spp. High prevalence (>80%) of Leptospira spp. DNA was detected in Chaerophon and Nycteris bat species captures in an abandoned well located within a human habitation. Sequences generated in this study were highly identical to Leptospira borgpetersenii and Leptospira interrogans and clustered with sequences of pathogenic species in GenBank. The detection of pathogenic Leptospira spp. was significantly associated (p < .001) with the bat species, feeding habit, roosting site and study location. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first molecular detection and characterization of pathogenic Leptospira spp. in bats from Nigeria. Results show that bats in Nigeria are infected with diverse Leptospira genotypes phylogenetically related to known pathogenic, including zoonotic taxa. Together, these findings reinforce bats’ roles as potential reservoirs of Leptospira spp. and should be considered as a starting point for future comparative studies to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of this bacterial pathogen in Nigeria.",

To corroborate decades-old reports of hantaviral antigens in shrews from Russia, archival liver and lung tissues from 4 Siberian large-toothed shrews (Sorex daphaenodon), 5 Eurasian least shrews (Sorex minutissimus), 12 ﬂat-skulled shrews (Sorex roboratus), and 18 tundra shrews (Sorex tundrensis), captured in the Sakha Republic in northeastern Siberia during July and August 2006, were analyzed for hantavirus RNA by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction. A novel hantavirus, named Kenkeme virus, was detected in a ﬂat-skulled shrew. Sequence analysis of the full-length S and partial M and L segments indicated that Kenkeme virus was genetically and phylogenetically distinct from Seewis virus harbored by the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus), as well as all other rodent-, soricid-, and talpid-borne hantaviruses.",

We provide information on postdispersal seed removal, germination and subsequent recruitment in tropical forest tree species Antiaris toxicaria in Ghana. We tested whether postdispersal seed removal and germination rates were differentially affected by the following seed treatments: seeds that were spat out by monkeys with all fruit pulp removed and spitting seeds with fruit pulp partially removed as observed in some birds and bats. We used seeds of intact ripened fruits as control. Frugivore seed treatment and distance from bole affected seed removal patterns, whereas intact seeds were signiﬁcantly removed from all seed stations. The germination success was greater for seeds that were spat out by monkeys and poor for seeds with fruit pulp partially removed and intact fruits. More recruits were recorded at the edge of the adult A. toxicaria canopy radius. There was weak relationship (r2 = 0.042) between the number of recruits and distance away from the adult tree. Results suggest that the subsequent recruitment in tropical forest tree species may be enhanced by some frugivore fruithandling behaviour where fruit pulp is removed from the seeds without destroying the seeds.",

Seed dispersal enhances germination potential, provides an opportunity for seeds to escape predation under the parent plants, and reduces seedling numbers under parent trees (Şekercioğlu\n              et al\n              . 2004). The way frugivores handle seeds and process them may influence the seed fate of many plants (Janzen 1971). The quantity of seeds dispersed and the quality of dispersal provided by frugivores impact plant fitness (Herrera & Jordano 1981). Schupp (1993) defined the effectiveness of seed dispersal by frugivores as an empirical measure of quantity of seeds dispersed and quality of dispersal from the parent plant to a suitable microsite. Seed dispersal by frugivores increases the chances for seedling survival away from the vicinity of the parent plant because in tropical forests seed predation is concentrated under adult trees that prevent seedlings from establishing near parent trees (Howe & Miriti 2004).",

Nevertheless, Haemosporidia parasite diversity in bats remains largely unstudied. In addition, some cases of unsuccessful PCR amplification of cytochrome\n              b\n              , the most widely used molecular marker to characterize Haemosporidia parasites, have recently been reported for\n              Nycteria\n              parasites infecting Nycteridae bats. Here we used next-generation sequencing to characterize mitochondrial genomes of parasites from the\n              Nycteria\n              genus. Our results have revealed an unsuspected mitochondrial genome rearrangement within Haemosporidia.\n            \n          , \n            \n              Haemosporidia parasites have mostly and abundantly been described using mitochondrial genes, and in particular cytochrome\n              b\n              (\n              cytb\n              ). Failure to amplify the mitochondrial\n              cytb\n              gene of\n              Nycteria\n              parasites isolated from Nycteridae bats has been recently reported. Bats are hosts to a diverse and profuse array of Haemosporidia parasites that remain largely unstudied. There is a need to obtain more molecular data from chiropteran parasites. Such data would help to better understand the evolutionary history of Haemosporidia, which notably include the\n              Plasmodium\n              parasites, malaria’s agents. We use next-generation sequencing to obtain the complete mitochondrial genome of\n              Nycteria\n              parasites from African\n              Nycteris grandis\n              (Nycteridae) and\n              Rhinolophus alcyone\n              (Rhinolophidae) and Asian\n              Megaderma spasma\n              (Megadermatidae). We report four complete mitochondrial genomes, including two rearranged mitochondrial genomes within Haemosporidia. Our results open outlooks into potentially undiscovered Haemosporidian diversity.",

Fossils of Myotis from Bat Cave, KY, were studied in an attempt to identify these specimens to species level. Southeastern Bats and endangered Indiana Bats dominated the fossil sample, with some Eastern Small-footed Bats and endangered Gray Bats. Such results demonstrate the ability to differentiate Myotis from historic and prehistoric sites and provide a tool for researchers to understand and potentially to conserve these species.",

Primary sex function, such as spermatogenesis, may also benefit from immune down-regulation since spermatozoa are not recognised as self by the immune system. Males with greater parasite resistance should therefore be able to experience higher androgens levels with a resultant increase in spermatogenic investment and ejaculate quality, plus greater suppression of the immune system. We investigate this possibility in two species of Australian bat. Testis size was used as a measure of ejaculate investment and quality, and spleen size was used as an indicator of immune function. Significant negative relationships were found between spleen and testis mass in one species and a negative trend was noted in a second. When the overall effect size was calculated, the negative association across both species was statistically significant. Our results are consistent with the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis since males able to withstand greater immune system down-regulation had larger testes.",

The conservation of these structures across the entire mammalian lineage demonstrates their importance. Information on a diverse set of spatially tuned neurons has become available, but we only have a rudimentary understanding of how anatomical network structure affects functional tuning. Bats are the only order of mammals that have evolved true flight, and with this specialization comes the need to navigate and behave in a three dimensional (3D) environment. Spatial tuning of cells in the entorhinal-hippocampal network of bats has been studied for some time, but whether the reported tuning in 3D is associated with changes in the entorhinal-hippocampal network is not known. Here we investigated the entorhinal-hippocampal projections in the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), by injecting chemical anterograde tracers in the entorhinal cortex. Detailed analyses of the terminations of these projections in the hippocampus showed that both the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex sent projections to the molecular layer of all subfields of the hippocampal formation. Our analyses showed that the terminal distributions of entorhinal fibers in the hippocampal formation of Egyptian fruit bats—including the proximo-distal and longitudinal topography and the layer-specificity—are similar to what has been described in other mammalian species such as rodents and primates. The major difference in entorhinal-hippocampal projections that was described to date between rodents and primates is in the terminal distribution of the DG projection. We found that bats have entorhinal-DG projections that seem more like those in primates than in rodents. It is likely that the latter projection in bats is specialized to the behavioral needs of this species, including 3D flight and long-distance navigation.",

Here we present the complete mitogenome of Geoffroy’s rousette, Rousettus amplexicaudatus found in Peninsular Malaysia . The mitogenome constructed is 16,511bp in length containing 37 genes; 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, two rRNA genes, and a D-loop region. The overall base composition is estimated to be 32.28% for A, 25.64% for T, 14.09% for G and 27.98% for C, indicating a slightly AT rich feature (57.93%). A phylogenetic and BLASTn analysis against other available mitogenomes showed Malaysian R. amplexicaudatus matched 98% similarity to the same species in Cambodia and Vietnam. However, it differed considerably (92.53% similarity) with the same species in the Philippines. This suggests flexibility in Rousettus sp. with regards to adapting to mesic and dry habitats, ability for long-distance dispersal and remarkably precise lingual echolocation thus supporting its widerange distribution and colonization. Further taxonomical and mitogenomic comparatives are required in resolving the evolutionary relationship between Rousettus spp.",

            "abstractNote": "We compared sequence variation in the complete mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene with chromosomal and geographical variation for specimens of Peters’ tent-making bat (Uroderma bilobatum). Three different chromosomal races have been described in this species: a 2n = 42 race from South America east of the Andes, a 2n = 44 from NW Central America and 2n = 38 from the rest of Central America and NW South America. The deepest nodes in the tree were found within the South American race (42 race), which is consistent with a longer history of this race. Average distance among races ranged from 2.5 to 2.9%, with the highest amount of intraracial variation found within the 2n = 42 race (1.7%), intermediate values within the 2n = 38 race (0.9%) and lowest within the 2n = 44 race (0.5%). Variation among chromosomal races accounted for over 55% of molecular variance, whereas variation among populations within races accounted for 6%. The 2n = 38 and 2n = 44 races hybridize in the coastal lowlands of Honduras, near the Gulf of Fonseca. Introgression between these two races is low (two introgressed individuals in 45 examined). Clinal variation across the hybrid zone for the cytochrome-b of U. bilobatum, is similar to clinal variation reported for chromosomes and isozymes of this species. Mismatch distribution analyses suggests that geographical isolation and karyological changes have interplayed in a synergistic fashion. Fixation of the alternative chromosomal rearrangements in geographical isolation and secondary contact is the most likely mechanism accounting for the hybrid zone between the 2n = 38 and 2n = 44 races. If a molecular clock is assumed, with rates ranging from 2.3 to 5.0% per million years, then isolation between these races occurred within the last million years, implying a relatively recent origin of the extant diversity in Uroderma bilobatum. None the less, the three chromosomal races probably represent three different biological species.",

Information ﬂow between layers is suggested to enable the SC to mediate goal-directed orienting movements. While most mammals strongly rely on vision for orienting, some species such as echolocating bats have developed alternative strategies, which raises the question how sensory maps are organized in these animals. We probed the visual system of the echolocating bat Phyllostomus discolor and found that binocular high acuity vision is frontally oriented and thus aligned with the biosonar system, whereas monocular visual ﬁelds cover a large area of peripheral space. For the ﬁrst time in echolocating bats, we could show that in contrast with other mammals, visual processing is restricted to the superﬁcial layers of the SC. The topographic representation of visual space, however, followed the general mammalian pattern. In addition, we found a clear topographic representation of sound azimuth in the deeper collicular layers, which was congruent with the superﬁcial visual space map and with a previously documented map of orienting movements. Especially for bats navigating at high speed in densely structured environments, it is vitally important to transfer and coordinate spatial information between sensors and motor systems. Here, we demonstrate ﬁrst evidence for the existence of congruent maps of sensory space in the bat SC that might serve to generate a uniﬁed representation of the environment to guide motor actions.",

We set out to better understand the difference between mist netting and acoustic detection probabilities between these two methods for the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), a species highly impacted by white-­nose syndrome and currently considered for federal listing in the United States. We also analyzed occupancy relationships with local and landcover variables. We surveyed 15 sites using mist netting paired with an acoustic recorder for multiple nights to estimate detection probability of this species. We also deployed acoustic recorders at another 73 sites. We found that detection rates for mist netting were very low but increased with day of year and decreased from proximity to water. Acoustic surveys had higher detection rates, but there was an approximately 30% likelihood of false-­ positive detections. At the mean distance to water and day of year, acoustic surveys had a detection rate 55 times higher than mist netting. There were not significant factors influencing occupancy of little brown bats, only a slight positive relationship between forested largest patch, landscape patch richness and forest basal area. Given the declines in little brown bat populations since white-­nose syndrome, it is even more critical that we consider the very low detection rate of mist netting compared to acoustic surveys.",

Yet our knowledge about call intensities in the ﬁeld is restricted to a small number of species. We describe a novel stereo videogrammetry method used to study ﬂight and echolocation behaviour, and to measure call source levels of the aerial hawking bat Eptesicus bottae (Vespertilionidae). Bats ﬂew close to their predicted minimum power speed. Source level increased with call duration; the loudest call of E. bottae was at 133·dB·peSPL. The calculated maximum detection distance for large ﬂying objects (e.g. large prey, conspeciﬁcs) was up to 21·m. The corresponding maximum echo delay is almost exactly the duration of one wing beat in E. bottae and this also is its preferred pulse interval. These results, obtained by using videogrammetry to track bats in the ﬁeld, corroborate earlier ﬁndings from other species from acoustic tracking methods.",

            "abstractNote": "The decision on when to emerge from the safety of a roost and forage for prey is thought to be a result of the trade off between peak insect abundance and predation pressure for bats. In this study we show that the velvety free-tailed bat Molossus molossus emerges just after sunset and just before sunrise for very short foraging bouts (average 82.2 min foraging per night). Contrary to previous studies, bats remain inactive in their roost between activity patterns. Activity was measured over two complete lunar cycles and there was no indication that phase of the moon had an influence on emergence time or the numbers of bats that emerged from the roost. This data suggests that M. molossus represents an example of an aerial hawking bat whose foraging behaviour is in fact adapted to the compromise between the need to exploit highest prey availability and the need to avoid predation.",

Body mass and length of forearm at birth were lowest when precipitation in the month preceding births was relatively high. In addition, body mass at birth was signi®cantly lower when ambient temperatures during late pregnancy were relatively low. Pups born to middle age mothers were heavier than pups born to young or old mothers. When evaluated using mark±recapture data (longitudinal method), postnatal growth in length of forearm and body mass was greater for pups born to middle age and older mothers and change in body mass was greater for female pups than for male pups. When growth data were evaluated using the trajectory method, the rate of growth for length of forearm was greatest when ambient temperature was highest. Age prediction equations were improved when maternal age was incorporated into predictive equations. We recommend considering both intrinsic and extrinsic variables in studies where maternal effort is evaluated and age prediction equations are used for estimating postnatal growth rates in free-ranging bats.",

To reduce the impact of White-nose Syndrome to North American little brown bat populations we evaluated if exposure to volatile organic compounds produced by induced cells from Rhodococcus rhodochrous strain DAP96253 could improve the overwinter survival of bats infected by P. destructans. Two simultaneous field treatment trials were conducted at natural hibernacula located in Rockcastle and Breckinridge counties, Kentucky, USA. A combined total of 120 little brown bats were randomly divided into control groups (n = 60) which were not exposed to volatile organic compounds and treatment groups (n = 60) which were exposed to volatile organic compounds produced by non-growth, fermented cell paste composed of R. rhodochrous strain DAP96253 cells. Cox proportional hazard models revealed a significant decreased survival at the Rockcastle field trial site but not the Breckinridge field site. At the Breckinridge hibernacula, overwinter survival for both treatment and control groups were 60%. At the Rockcastle hibernacula, Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated significantly increased overwinter survival of bats in the control group (43% survived) compared to the treatment group (20% survived). Although complete inhibition of P. destructans by volatile organic compounds produced by induced R. rhodochrous strain DAP96253 cells was observed in vitro studies, our results suggest that these volatile organic compounds do not inhibit P. destructans in situ and may promote P. destructans growth.",

Similar to other European pipistrelles, the frequency structure during foraging varied. During the search phase, the bats emitted long shallow frequency-modulated pulses 9 – 11 ms in duration, whereas the maximum pulse duration of the bats approaching a large target wall in the laboratory was 3 ms. No signiﬁcant difference was observed between decreases in the interpulse interval during these two approach ﬂights. It is concluded that the bats use a long quasi-constant frequency pulse to ﬁnd a weak echo from a small prey target.",

The terminal frequency of the second harmonic (TF2) of pup vocalizations corresponded to that of the fundamental (TF1) in adult bats (41.4 6 2.6 kHz), suggesting that pup vocalizations can be easily detected by the mother. In addition, there are two types of infant vocalization: short duration echolocation precursor and long duration isolation calls, which showed separate developmental patterns over time.",

At least 7 species of mammals belonging to Insectivora (Crocidura suaveolens) and Rodentia (Allactaga williamsi, Cricetulus migratorius, Meriones tristrami, Mescocricetus brandti, Microtus guentheri, M. sp., Mus macedonicus) were identified. Rodentia were dominant and contributed 93.8% of the number of prey items of the Long-eared Owl. Microtus guentheri accounted for 83.9% of the rodent remains. The diet pattern was more diverse in summer, when some 24% of the diet consisted of non-mammal prey items (birds, insects).",

Later in limb development,\n              Shh\n              and\n              Ptc1\n              expression is reinitiated in the interdigital tissue.\n              Shh\n              is graded along the A-P axis in forelimb and is expressed uniformly at a lower level across the hindlimb interdigital tissue. We also show that the reported\n              Fgf8\n              expression in the interdigital tissue precedes the expression of\n              Shh.\n              We propose that the reinitiation of\n              Shh\n              and\n              Fgf8\n              expression in bat limbs reactivates the\n              Shh-Fgf\n              feedback loop in the interdigital tissue of stage 16 bat embryos. The cell survival and proliferation signals provided by the\n              Shh-Fgf\n              signaling loop probably contribute to the lengthening of the posterior forelimb digits, the survival of the forelimb interdigital webbing, and the extension of the hindlimb digits to a uniform length.",

The characteristic lesions include hemoglobinuric nephrosis and piecemeal hepatic necrosis with bile ductular hyperplasia and portal ﬁbrosis. Certain species, such as sheep, are prone to toxicity when exposed to copper in feed, whereas an inherent genetic defect of copper storage is present in some breeds of dogs (Bedlington Terriers, West Highland White Terriers, Doberman Pinschers). In nondomestic species, reference ranges have not been established for copper in internal organs, so the establishment of copper toxicity as a diagnosis is difﬁcult. A case of copper toxicity in a captive Mexican fruit bat is presented. Hepatic copper levels in 16 additional bats, of at least 3 different species, were measured. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst reported case of copper toxicity in a chiropteran.",

The fish-eating bat Myotis vivesi is restricted mainly to the islands of the Gulf of California in Mexico and although several aspects of its biology have been studied there are no recent accounts of its current distribution. We conducted several expeditions during – to verify the current geographical distribution of this bat, and to record the presence of introduced predators. We identified the localities in which maternity colonies occur, estimated the size of the bat population on Partida Norte Island in , and monitored bat presence on this island during –. We found fish-eating bats on  islands and maternity colonies on  islands. Introduced rats Rattus rattus or cats Felis catus were captured on seven islands where the bats were present, and on five islands where they were absent. We estimated a population of c. , fish-eating bats in May  and we confirmed the species’ presence on Partida Norte Island during –. Based on the information compiled from our surveys and previous studies, we discuss the adequacy of the species’ current categorization as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and its conservation status conferred by Mexican conservation authorities.",

Over 2 yr, we documented the dynamics of tent construction and use by Uroderma convexum and other bat species in the palm Sabal mauritiiformis in a Colombian transitional dry forest. We also assessed tent condition and compared it to nonmodiﬁed leaves of approximately the same age in focal palms. Probability of tent use by U. convexum varied between 57 percent during a reproductive period and 4 percent outside of this period. Bats cut the main vein of folioles, partially affecting water transport in the leaf. However, there were no differences between tents and nonmodiﬁed leaves in deterioration scores or deterioration rates over 1 yr. During 2 yr, 48 tents were lost for different causes, but this loss was balanced by the construction of 51 new tents. Thus, bats maintained an excess of usable tents. Palm leaves are long-lived and seem preadapted to sustain damage and remain viable, particularly in species growing in dry environments. We present several hypotheses to explain the advantage of maintaining a tent surplus.",

A comparison of the succession of morphological events associated with each node (inflorescences or branches developed or aborted and underlying internode length) making up the axes of 30 trees helped to establish a link between their architecture and the regularity and synchronicity of their expression of growth, flowering, and branching processes over time on an individual and stand level. For a given individual, new nodes are emitted at the same rate on all the axes, irrespective of their branching order. Flowering and branching alternate, and these processes occur in all the axes of the tree synchronously. On a stand level, flowering and branching occur regularly every 35 nodes or so, which apparently corresponds to an annual rhythm. Under nonlimiting conditions, a single branch tier would be emitted each year, and it is thus possible to determine a posteriori the age of a crown accurately. The merits of the method, the possibility of estimating the age of natural\n              Cecropia obtusa\n              regrowth by observing tree architecture, and the possible applications in the field of ecology are discussed.",

Its possible admission to the list of British mammals depends upon a single specimen found on South Ronaldsay, Orkney, in about September 1847 (Wolley, 1849, 1850\n              a, b\n              ). From Wolley's detailed account and description, there seems no doubt of the circumstances of the finding of the specimen, nor of its identity. Doubts are only raised by the existence of a specimen of\n              Lasiurus\n              in the Zoology Museum of the University of Cambridge which had been supposed to be the Orkney specimen. This specimen was examined by Barrett‐Hamilton (1910) who reported that it was an example of the Hawaiian form\n              L. c. semotus\n              (he used the name\n              Nycteris semota\n              ), noted that it did not match Wolley's careful description, but concluded “the matter is not as clear as it might be”. This doubt has persisted to the present day, and while the record is mentioned in some accounts (e.g. van den Brink, 1967), it is omitted completely from others, notably Corbet & Southern (1977). The uncertainty has prompted this brief re‐examination of the issue; in particular, what is the identity of the specimen in Cambridge, how does it compare with Wolley's account of the Orkney specimen, and what, in the light of modern knowledge of\n              L. cinereus\n              , is the likelihood of its occurrence as a vagrant in Britain?",

            "abstractNote": "Detailed knowledge of histomorphology is a prerequisite for the understanding of function, variation, and development. In bats, as in other mammals, penis and baculum morphology are important in species discrimination and phylogenetic studies. In this study, nondestructive 3D-microtomographic (microCT, mCT) images of bacula and iodine-stained penes of Pipistrellus pipistrellus were correlated with light microscopic images from undecalciﬁed surface-stained ground sections of three of these penes of P. pipistrellus (1 juvenile). The results were then compared with mCTimages of bacula of P. pygmaeus, P. hanaki, and P. nathusii. The Y-shaped baculum in all studied Pipistrellus species has a proximal base with two clubshaped branches, a long slender shaft, and a forked distal tip. The branches contain a medullary cavity of variable size, which tapers into a central canal of variable length in the proximal baculum shaft. Both are surrounded by a lamellar and a woven bone layer and contain fatty marrow and blood vessels. The distal shaft consists of woven bone only, without a vascular canal. The proximal ends of the branches are connected with the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa via entheses. In the penis shaft, the corpus spongiosumsurrounded urethra lies in a ventral grove of the corpora cavernosa, and continues in the glans under the baculum. The glans penis predominantly comprises an enlarged corpus spongiosum, which surrounds urethra and baculum. In the 12 studied juvenile and subadult P. pipistrellus specimens the proximal branches of the baculum were shorter and without marrow cavity, while shaft and distal tip appeared already fully developed. The present combination with light microscopic images from one species enabled a more reliable interpretation of histomorphological structures in the mCT-images from all four Pipistrellus species. J.

This can derive not only from genetic mutations, but also from other sources like infectious diseases that result in color patterns which are different from those characteristic of each species. In bats, most pigmentation abnormalities have been observed in the families Phyllostomidae and Vespertilionidae, probably because they are the largest families in number of species and have been exceptionally well studied. For the Mormoopidae family only two cases are known. This paper documents the first case of hypopigmentation disorder in the bat Mormoops megalophylla throughout its range, recorded in two specimens captured in the state of Oaxaca, México.",

Here, we report a 47.89% Brucella infection prevalence in a colony of vampire bats inhabiting the tropical rainforest of Costa Rica. The bacterium induced placentitis and fetal death in bats. Wide-range phenotypic and genotypic characterization placed the Brucella organisms as a new pathogenic species named Brucella nosferati sp. nov., isolated from bat tissues, including the salivary glands, suggesting feeding behavior might favor transmission to their prey. Overall analyses placed B. nosferati as the etiological agent of a reported canine brucellosis case, demonstrating its potential for infecting other hosts. To assess the putative prey hosts, we analyzed the intestinal contents of 14 infected and 23 non-infected bats by proteomics. A total of 54,508 peptides sorted into 7,203 unique peptides corresponding to 1,521 proteins were identified. Twenty-three wildlife and domestic taxa, including humans, were foraged by B. nosferati-infected D. rotundus, suggesting contact of this bacterium with a broad range of hosts. Our approach is appropriate for detecting, in a single study, the prey preferences of vampire bats in a diverse area, demonstrating its suitability for control strategies where vampire bats thrive.",

The ﬂowers present nocturnal anthesis, copious nectar production and sugar concentration (range 18–23%) suitable for nocturnal visitors such as bats and sphingid moths. The main nocturnal visitors were bats and sphingid moths while bees were the main diurnal visitors. There were no differences in legitimate visitation rates among bats, moths and honey bees. Bats and honey bees fed mainly on pollen while moths fed on nectar, suggesting resource partitioning. Eight species of bats carried pollen but Leptonycteris yerbabuenae is probably the most effective pollinator due to its higher pollen loads. The sphingid moths Manduca rustica, Cocytius duponchel and Eumorpha satellitia were recorded visiting ﬂowers. Hand pollination experiments indicated a predominant outcrossing breeding system. Open pollination experiments resulted in a null fruit set, indicating pollen limitation; however, mean reproductive success, according to a seasonal census, was 17 ± 3%; these contrasting results could be explained by the seasonal availability of pollinators. We conclude that P. aquatica is an outcrossing species with a pollination system originally specialized for bats and sphingid moths, which could be driven to a multimodal pollination system due to the introduction of honey bees to tropical America.",

However, we have virtually no information on whether and how disruptions in bat‐mediated biocontrol services are driven by mismatches between the temporal activity patterns of insectivorous bats and insect pests.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We investigated the temporal relationship between the nightly activity patterns of the common pipistrelle bat (\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii\n                    ) and the olive fruit moth (\n                    Prays oleae\n                    ).

Olive farms were classified as exhibiting high (i.e. HIGH olive farms;\n                    n\n                     = 27), intermediate (MID;\n                    n\n                     = 18), and low (LOW;\n                    n\n                     = 15) structural complexity.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Temporal mismatches between the activity levels of\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    and\n                    P. oleae\n                    varied between seasons and types of olive farms, being comparatively lower in summer than in spring and fall. Furthermore, summer was the only season in which temporal mismatches between species pairs differed between types of olive farms, with higher temporal mismatches found in LOW than in HIGH and MID olive farms.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Overall, our work demonstrates the existence of temporal mismatches between the nightly activity patterns of\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    and\n                    P. oleae\n                    . Furthermore, it demonstrates that the structural simplification of olive farms increases temporal mismatches between species pairs, particularly in summer when bat‐mediated biocontrol services are most needed.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . Future research should consider mismatches between the temporal activity patterns of insectivorous bats and insect pests. Otherwise, the actual impact of agricultural intensification on bat‐mediated biocontrol services as well as the economic impact of their loss on the agriculture industry might be underestimated. To enhance biocontrol services, we propose increasing the availability of suitable roosting and foraging sites as well as conserving areas of remnant native woodland and scattered hollow‐bearing trees.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            Resumo\n            \n              \n                \n                  Os serviços de biocontrole são amplamente reconhecidos por providenciarem incentivos fundamentais para a conservação de morcegos. No entanto, não existe virtualmente nenhuma informação sobre se e como as disrupções nos serviços de biocontrole mediados por morcegos são causadas por divergências entre os padrões temporais de atividade de morcegos insetívoros e insetos‐praga.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Investigámos a relação temporal entre os padrões de atividade noturna do morcego‐de‐kuhl (\n                    Pipistrellus kuhlii\n                    ) e da traça‐da‐oliveira (\n                    Prays oleae\n                    ).

Os olivais foram classificados como exibindo complexidade estrutural alta (HIGH;\n                    n\n                     = 27), intermédia (MID;\n                    n\n                     = 18) ou baixa (LOW;\n                    n\n                     = 15).\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    As divergências temporais entre os níveis de atividade de\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    e\n                    P. oleae\n                    variaram entre as estações do ano e tipos de olivais, sendo comparativamente menores no verão do que na primavera e outono. Além disso, o verão foi a única estação em que as divergências temporais entre pares de espécies diferiram entre tipos de olivais, com divergências temporais mais elevadas em olivais LOW do que em olivais HIGH e MID.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    No geral, o nosso trabalho demonstra a existência de divergências temporais entre os padrões de atividade noturna de\n                    P. kuhlii\n                    e\n                    P. oleae\n                    . Além disso, demonstra que a simplificação estrutural dos olivais aumenta as divergências temporais entre pares de espécies, especialmente no verão, quando os serviços de biocontrole mediados por morcegos são mais necessários.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Síntese e aplicações\n                    : Os trabalhos de investigação no futuro devem ter em conta as divergências entre os padrões temporais de atividade de morcegos insetívoros e insetos‐praga. Caso contrário, o impacto real da intensificação agrícola nos serviços de biocontrole mediados por morcegos, bem como o impacto económico da sua perda na indústria agrícola, pode ser subestimado. Para incrementar os serviços de biocontrole, propomos o aumento da disponibilidade de abrigos e locais de alimentação, bem como a conservação de áreas de bosques nativos remanescentes e árvores dispersas.",

Species that are forest dependent may be especially vulnerable to fragmentation because they have specialized resource requirements and may exhibit lower mobility in an agricultural matrix. We investigated movement patterns and resource selection of forest-dependent northern long-eared myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) in a forest–agricultural landscape on Prince Edward Island, Canada. Radiotelemetry was used to locate day-roosts and to estimate locations of female bats during nightly foraging bouts. Day-roost locations and foraging areas were mapped using a geographic information system to generally characterize the forest cover of foraging and roosting areas. Vegetative structure and insect prey availability were measured in the ﬁeld and compared between foraging and roosting areas to describe resource selection at these sites. Movements of female northern long-eared myotis were constrained to forest features and foraging areas were concentrated along forest-covered creeks with bats roosting predominantly in deciduous trees within the same forest fragment, although bats at 1 site seemed to exclusively use a barn during late pregnancy and lactation. Differences in prey availability did not explain the spatial segregation of roosting and foraging areas. Relative to roost areas foraging sites were more likely to be close to forested creeks and densely forested areas, whereas roost sites were characterized by the availability of potentially suitable roosts. This study demonstrates the importance of investigating movements and resource selection of individuals in fragmented landscapes because a specialization on forest resources can highly restrict the vagility of forest-dependent species to a local environment.",

Acerodon jubatus (the Golden-Crowned flying fox) is an endemic species in the Philippines, which was suspected to be a host of the Reston strain of the Ebola virus. As nocturnal animals, the flying foxes spend daytime at the roosting site, which they use for self-maintenance and reproduction. To understand the variation in diurnal behavior and time allocation for various activities in the Golden-Crowned flying fox, we investigated their daytime behavior and activity budget using instantaneous scan sampling and all occurrence focal sampling. Data collection was performed from 07:00 to 18:00 hr during January 8–17, 2017. The most frequent activity was sleeping (76.3%). The remaining activities were wing flapping (5.0%), self-grooming (4.2%), hanging relaxation (3.4%), wing spread (2.9%), movement (2.4%), mating/courtship (2.4%), aggression (1.9%), hanging alert (1.2%), excretion (0.1%) and scent marks (0.05%). The frequency of sleeping, wing flapping, self-grooming, hanging relaxation, aggression, mating/courtship and movement behaviors changed with the time of the day. Females allocated more time for resting than males, while males spent more time on the activities that helped enhance their mating opportunities, for example, movement, sexual activity and territorial behavior.",

Understanding their population dynamics might help to explain seasonal patterns of disease prevalence, and contribute towards the conservation of flying fox populations. Therefore, this study explored the annual variation in the number of deaths in P. lylei. The study was conducted from 2015–2017, at a Buddhist temple in Thailand, which is the roosting site of P. lylei. The average total number of bat deaths in a month significantly varied between times of a year. A peak was observed during March and May, which ranged in the period of birthing and lactating. There were no significant differences in the average total number of bat deaths in a month between sexes or age classes across times of a years.",

            "abstractNote": "In this study, we explicitly examine the aerodynamics of manoeuvring flight in animals. We studied brown long-eared bats flying in a wind tunnel while performing basic sideways manoeuvres. We used particle image velocimetry in combination with high-speed filming to link aerodynamics and kinematics to understand the mechanistic basis of manoeuvres. We predicted that the bats would primarily use the downstroke to generate the asymmetries for the manoeuvre since it has been shown previously that the majority of forces are generated during this phase of the wingbeat. We found instead that the bats more often used the upstroke than they used the downstroke for this. We also found that the bats used both drag/thrust-based and lift-based asymmetries to perform the manoeuvre and that they even frequently switch between these within the course of a manoeuvre. We conclude that the bats used three main modes: lift asymmetries during downstroke, thrust/drag asymmetries during downstroke and thrust/drag asymmetries during upstroke. For future studies, we hypothesize that lift asymmetries are used for fast turns and thrust/drag for slow turns and that the choice between up- and downstroke depends on the timing of when the bat needs to generate asymmetries.",
