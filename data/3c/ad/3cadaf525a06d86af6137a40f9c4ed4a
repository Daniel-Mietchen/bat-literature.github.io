Seed production is one possible point of recruitment failure, and one that the spatial arrangement of trees may affect.We sampled 118 Eucalyptus microcarpa (Myrtaceae) trees to compare and analyse the determinants of seed production in this dominant tree of modiﬁed, fragmented temperate grassy woodlands, which extend over much of southeastern Australia. Fecundity was estimated as the seed crop measured on leaf mass and whole tree bases and was compared between categories of tree conﬁguration.We also modelled fecundity using boosted regression trees, a new and ﬂexible tool. Fecundity on a leaf mass basis was predominantly inﬂuenced by environmental factors (topographic ‘wetness’, slope, soil type), rather than by local tree density and conﬁguration. Fewer seed per unit leaf mass were produced on ﬂat and topographically wet sites, reﬂecting poor tolerance of waterlogging by E. microcarpa. By contrast, whole tree fecundity was little inﬂuenced by environmental factors. Local tree density and conﬁguration did inﬂuence whole tree fecundity, which was high in solitary and woodland-spaced trees and reduced under high local density. We found little evidence for reduced fecundity of E. microcarpa in solitary trees. This points to the importance of scattered trees as sources of seed for tree recruitment and for natural regeneration of landscape level tree cover. Considerable uncertainty remains in modelled seed supply, and may be reduced with sampling across multiple years and greater environmental and spatial domains.",

Insectivorous bats in temperate regions are faced with the challenge of building up fat reserves vital for hibernation during a period of decreasing arthropod abundances. According to optimal foraging theory, prehibernating bats should adopt a less selective feeding behaviour –yet empirical studies have revealed many apparently generalized species to be composed of specialist individuals. Targeting the diet of the bat Myotis daubentonii, we used a combination of molecular techniques to test for seasonal changes in prey selectivity and individual-level variation in prey preferences. DNA metabarcoding was used to characterize both the prey contents of bat droppings and the insect community available as prey. To test for dietary differences among M. daubentonii individuals, we used ten microsatellite loci to assign droppings to individual bats. The comparison between consumed and available prey revealed a preference for certain prey items regardless of availability. Nonbiting midges (Chironomidae) remained the most highly consumed prey at all times, despite a signiﬁcant increase in the availability of black ﬂies (Simuliidae) towards the end of the season. The bats sampled showed no evidence of individual specialization in dietary preferences. Overall, our approach offers little support for optimal foraging theory. Thus, it shows how novel combinations of genetic markers can be used to test general theory, targeting patterns at both the level of prey communities and individual predators.",

We recently showed they harbour bacterial pathogen\n              Klebsiella pneumoniae\n              and closely related species in the\n              K\n              .\n              pneumoniae\n              species complex (\n              Kp\n              SC); however, the dynamics of\n              Kp\n              SC transmission and gene flow within flying fox colonies are poorly understood. High‐resolution genome comparisons of 39\n              Kp\n              SC isolates from grey‐headed flying foxes identified five putative strain transmission clusters (four intra‐ and one inter‐colony). The instance of inter‐colony strain transmission of\n              K\n              .\n              africana\n              was found between two flying fox populations within flying distance, indicating either direct or indirect transmission through a common food/water source. All 11 plasmids identified within the\n              Kp\n              SC isolates showed 73% coverage (mean) and ≥95% identity to human‐associated\n              Kp\n              SC plasmids, indicating gene flow between human clinical and grey‐headed flying fox isolates. Along with strain transmission, inter‐species horizontal plasmid transmission between\n              K\n              .\n              pneumoniae\n              and\n              Klebsiella africana\n              was also identified within a flying fox colony. Finally, genome‐scale metabolic models were generated to predict and compare substrate usage to previously published\n              Kp\n              SC models, from human and environmental sources. These models indicated no distinction on the basis of metabolic capabilities. Instead, metabolic capabilities were consistent with population structure and ST/lineage.",

Although Australian ﬂying-foxes of the genus Pteropus have been identiﬁed as reservoir hosts, the precise mechanism of HeV transmission has yet to be elucidated. To date, there has been limited investigation into the role of haematophagous insects as vectors of HeV. This mode of transmission is particularly relevant because Australian ﬂying-foxes host the batspeciﬁc blood-feeding ectoparasites of the genus Cyclopodia (Diptera: Nycteribiidae), also known as bat ﬂies. Using molecular detection methods, we screened for HeV RNA in 183 bat ﬂies collected from ﬂying-foxes inhabiting a roost in Boonah, Queensland, Australia. It was subsequently demonstrated that during the study period, Pteropus alecto in this roost had a HeV RNA prevalence between 2 and 15% (95% CI [1, 6] to [8, 26], respectively). We found no evidence of HeV in any bat ﬂies tested, including 10 bat ﬂies collected from P. alecto in which we detected HeV RNA. Our negative ﬁndings are consistent with previous ﬁndings and provide additional evidence that bat ﬂies do not play a primary role in HeV transmission.",

            "abstractNote": "For parasites in natural systems, the most common pattern of spatial distribution is aggregation among hosts. The main causes of such aggregation are variable exposure of hosts to parasites and heterogeneity in host susceptibility. The objective of this study was to determine if there are differences in the aggregation pattern of two species of ectoparasitic flies between the Pantanal and Cerrado regions of Brazil on the bat Artibeus planirostris. We collected the ectoparasites from bats captured between 2002 and 2017 with mist nets in 21 sites in the Pantanal and 15 sites in the surrounding plateaus. The results showed that the aggregation of ectoparasitic flies in Pantanal was more pronounced than in Cerrado. The discrepancy aggregation index (D) of the bat fly Megistopoda aranea was 0.877 in Pantanal and 0.724 in Cerrado. The D values of Aspidoptera phyllostomatis was even higher, with 0.916 and 0.848 in the Pantanal and Cerrado, respectively. Differences in the shelters used may be the main factor shaping variation in aggregation, since the Pantanal does not have rock formations, with only foliage, crowns and hollow tree trunks. These differences likely affect host exposure to the parasites, leading to an increase in parasite aggregation.",

Avian predation, competition with birds, and hyperthermia may explain the origin of this behavior, but it is difficult to assess the validity of these hypotheses due to the rarity of diurnal activity in bats. In Gorgona National Natural Park, Colombia, the population of the lesser sac-winged bat (Emballonuridae: Saccopteryx leptura) has an unusual daylight flight activity, which provides an opportunity to learn about the origin of nocturnality in bats. We described the daylight activity of S. leptura in Gorgona Island and explored the influence of environmental factors at different spatiotemporal scales, potentially involved in this particular behavior. We registered the variation of light intensity and temperature across days, months, and different vegetation canopy covers and assessed their effects on the number of daylight flights. We found that the daytime activity of this insular population increases with vegetation cover, decreases with light intensity and temperature, and varies seasonally. These responses of flying activity to environmental temperature and light intensity seem to be related to avoiding the risk of overheating. Furthermore, bats were also active at night, and daytime flights included echolocation and feeding, which suggest that daytime activity complements but does not replace night-time activity. Consequently, our results provide empirical support for the notion that the nocturnality in bats can reflect the actions of avoiding overheating during the day.",

Female Angolan free-tailed bats displayed a seasonal bimodally polyoestrous reproductive pattern. Parturition in December was followed closely by a postpartum oestrus. Ovarian follicle and endometrium cycles also closely followed the breeding season. The reproductive tract displayed complete dextral dominance with the right ovary and uterus being functionally dominant. Luteal activity was maintained throughout pregnancy and healthy corpora lutea were observed until late in pregnancy. Shedding of the zona pellucida occurred in the oviduct in the region of the ampulla±isthmus junction. The embryo entered the uterus as a morula, where it was transformed into a unilaminar, free-lying blastocyst. A unique feature of the pre-implantation uterus was the formation of a distinct decidua at the implantation site on the mesometrial side. Implantation in the Angolan free-tailed bat was centric and super®cial. First attachment of the trophoblast to the endometrium was mesometrial. The formation of a pre-placental pad of trophoblast cells was also initiated on the mesometrial side, while orientation of the embryonic disc was anti-mesometrial. Placental development occurred in the abembryonic hemisphere. Proliferation of the trophoblast over the embryonic hemisphere was slow and a bilaminar arrangement of the trophoblast was not observed in this region until after the primitive streak stage.",

Racemes persist, developing intermittently pedunculate capitula over a period of more than one year. The brush‐type, whitish flower heads are nocturnal in anthesis and active only a single night. Florets are relatively large and stout for the genus, hermaphroditic, with stiff filaments and style, and converge towards the periphery of the raceme. When expanding at dusk, the heads produce large nectar drops (up to 173 μl per head), that averages 25–29% sucrose. Production starts sequentially among florets of a capitulum. The drops are freely exposed, held between the filaments. The glossophagine bat\n              Lonchophylla mordax\n              was observed as the only legitimate visitor; hummingbirds exploited worn capitula at daytime, but did not pollinate. The bats lapped the nectar while hovering without apparently putting out their tongues. Pollen transmission was by the snout and probably by touching neighbouring flower heads with the wings. The blossoms, of a genus predominantly entomophilous, reveal habitual adaptation to bat pollination in most of their features. Small size (14 mm in diam.) and lack of a perceptible scent suggest that an evolutionary shift towards chiropterophily is still incomplete. A brief survey of the known distribution of bat pollination in Mimosaceae is appended.",

            "abstractNote": "Floral adaptation to pollination by bats is rare in Acanthaceae and only known from neotropical species. Two novel cases are described in detail from field observations. Harpochilus neesianus, a shrub endemic in NE Brazil, with long emergent thyrses, was seen being regularly visited by hovering glossophagine bats (Glossophaga soricina). Its large, pale lemon-green corollas are strongly bilabiate, a shape uncommon in the syndrome. The lower lip segments are recurved and the upper lip is reduced to a narrow, arcuate, tubular organ serving to support stamens and style. A sour, cabbage-like odour is released, and copious nectar is secreted by a voluminous disk. Pollen is transferred by the bat’s upper, rear surface. Anthesis is confined to a single night. Chiropterophily in Ruellia eurycodon is deduced from the floral syndrome. The flowers of this shrub, studied in Goyás, Central Brazil, share the same features as Harpochilus except for the corolla shape, which conforms to the “short bell type” frequent in neotropical bat flowers. Based on literature sources, bat pollination is also predicted for Ruellia malaca and R. exostemma from Venezuela. The occurrence of this floral type in other genera of the family is briefly surveyed.",

We assessed individual traits and immune response of the host individuals as well as host species ecology. We found 8 host-speciﬁc species/morphotypes of Litomosoides microﬁlariae in 5 bat species, with 5 individuals showing multiple infections. Our study includes the ﬁrst records of Litomosoides brasiliensis in Artibeus jamaicensis and of Litomosoides-like and Litomosa-like microﬁlaria in Lophostoma silvicolum. Multiple binary regression analysis showed that the presence of speciﬁc Litomosoides species was inﬂuenced by host species, sex, and reproductive status.",

We monitored estrogen and 20-oxo-pregnane metabolites in fecal samples collected daily from 19 free-ranging female Saccopteryx bilineata during the assumed mating season. Median fecal estrogen metabolite levels equaled 0.09 ng/g for the pre- and postovulatory periods and 4.2 ng/g for the follicular phase of the estrous cycle in female S. bilineata. Median fecal 20-oxo-pregnane metabolite levels were 50.9 ng/g in preestrous, 88.8 ng/g in estrous, and 190.2 ng/g in postestrous females. Reliability of fecal steroid metabolite analysis was supported by results of video observations. Two successful copulations for a single male–female pair were recorded; mating coincided with peak fecal estrogen levels (7.0 ng/g) in the copulating female. In contrast, 2 observed mating attempts in a 2nd male–female pair occurred approximately 19 days after the female’s physiological estrus and fecal estrogen metabolites in the rejecting female were only 0.2 ng/g. Fecal 20oxo-pregnane levels were almost 3 times lower in fecal samples collected from the copulating female than those from the rejecting female (157 ng/g versus 410 ng/g). All females that were still present in the colony 6 months later gave birth to a single offspring between late May and early June. Gestation length averaged (mean 6 SE) 169 6 2 days. During the 20 days preceding parturition, fecal 20-oxo-pregnane metabolites were approximately 100 times higher than during the mating period. Fecal 20-oxo-pregnane metabolites of lactating females were comparable to those during the mating season. Noninvasive fecal steroid analysis can be a valuable tool for monitoring reproductive events in colonies of free-ranging small-sized bats.",

However, later in succession bats may carry seeds in both directions. We used an isotopic approach to reveal the direction of seed transfer mediated by three co-existing short-tailed fruit bats (Carollia castanea, C. sowelli and C. perspicillata) between a forest and an adjacent mid-successional site (>15 y since deforestation); two habitats where individuals of the genus Piper differed in stable carbon isotope ratios by ∼2.5‰. In a feeding experiment, we conﬁrmed that δ13C of seeds is not altered by digestive processes. We then collected seeds defecated by bats of the genus Carollia and found that δ13C of these seeds is higher than those of Piper individuals growing in the forest, irrespective of whether bats were captured in or outside the forest. We conclude that bats of the genus Carollia were more likely to carry seeds from successional areas into the forest than in the opposite direction.",

Using a stable isotope approach, we tested in colonies of vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) whether food sharing occurs among few or many females; vampires are known to regurgitate recently ingested blood for starving conspeciﬁcs. Accordingly, the isotopic signatures of vampires depend not only on individual prey choice but also on the extent of food sharing among isotopically contrasting conspeciﬁcs. By measuring the stable carbon isotope ratio in tissues with varying isotopic retention in individual vampires (blood: approx. 2 wk; wing membrane tissue: approx. 2 mo; fur: >6 mo), we estimated the variation in the percentages of carbon derived from pasture (via blood from cattle and horses). We expected to ﬁnd narrow ranges of percentages in individual vampires, because we anticipated food sharing only within small female networks if food sharing happened at all. Overall, vampire bats obtained 79.2 Æ 12.3% of carbon from grazers. The range of percentages was small within the majority of individuals in relation to that across all individuals, suggesting that most vampires were isotopic specialists. We expected females to be more isotopically generalistic than males, as food sharing was observed to occur more often between females than between males. Indeed, stable isotope evidence suggested that more females obtained carbon from isotopically contrasting sources than males. This pattern is consistent with food sharing in small groups of female vampires, provided that food sharing occurred at all.",

            "abstractNote": "For the majority of Rhinolophus species a karyotype consisting of either 58 or 62 chromosomes was reported. The members of the R. trifoliatus clade are therefore distinguished from other rhinolophids by low diploid chromosome numbers (2n) and a high rate of chromosomal changes. Recently, based on cytogenetic characters, a cryptic species, R. luctoides, was described and a subspecies, R. luctus morio, was elevated to species rank. In the present work, the karyotypes of a male bat from Vietnam and a female one from China, both classified as R. luctus by morphological characters, were studied by G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole chromosome painting probes derived from Aselliscus stoliczkanus. In the male specimen from Vietnam, the composition of the 15 autosomal bi-armed pairs (2n = 32, FN = 60) is identical to that of R. luctoides from Malaysia. For reason of differences in body size and baculum length as well as in skull morphology, this specimen is provisionally treated as R. cf. luctoides. The karyotype of the female specimen from Sichuan province, China, differs from R. luctoides by a whole arm reciprocal translocation resulting in an altered arm composition of pairs 3 and 4. For this reason, the elevation of the Chinese subspecies of R. luctus, i.e. R. lanosus, to species rank is suggested. The karyotype of the endemic Taiwanese species R. formosae with a diploid number of 2n = 52 is mainly composed of acrocentric autosomal pairs. Of the five bi-armed pairs, only the two smallest show the same arm composition as found in the 2n = 32 karyotypes of other members of the R. trifoliatus clade. The composition of the remaining three bi-armed pairs is unique and represents an apomorphic feature for R. formosae.",

            "abstractNote": "Aerodynamic theory has long been used to predict the power required for animal flight, but widely used models contain many simplifications. It has been difficult to ascertain how closely biological reality matches model predictions, largely because of the technical challenges of accurately measuring the power expended when an animal flies. We designed a study to measure flight speed-dependent aerodynamic power directly from the kinetic energy contained in the wake of bats flying in a wind tunnel. We compared these measurements with two theoretical predictions that have been used for several decades in diverse fields of vertebrate biology and to metabolic measurements from a previous study using the same individuals. A high-accuracy displaced laser sheet stereo particle image velocimetry experimental design measured the wake velocities in the Trefftz plane behind four bats flying over a range of speeds (3–7 m s\n              −1\n              ). We computed the aerodynamic power contained in the wake using a novel interpolation method and compared these results with the power predicted by Pennycuick's and Rayner's models. The measured aerodynamic power falls between the two theoretical predictions, demonstrating that the models effectively predict the appropriate range of flight power, but the models do not accurately predict minimum power or maximum range speeds. Mechanical efficiency—the ratio of aerodynamic power output to metabolic power input—varied from 5.9% to 9.8% for the same individuals, changing with flight speed.",

We present the results of the first study to assess whether litters of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) containing dizygotic twins share the same father. We sampled 26 mother–offspring triads from three colonies in Indiana and Illinois, as well as 299 additional adults (237 females and 62 males) from these colonies and six other maternity colonies in the same area in 1997–1998. All individuals were genotyped at nine highly variable autosomal microsatellite loci and one X-linked locus. We assessed multiple paternity using autosomal and X-linked locus exclusions, and using maximum-likelihood methods. All methods confirmed multiple paternity within litters, and the maximum-likelihood analyses indicated that almost half of the sampled litters were composed of maternal half-siblings rather than full-siblings. Our results highlight the potential importance of post-copulatory mechanisms of paternity determination in the mating system of big brown bats, and have important implications for gene flow and population structuring in this species.",

The additional time associated with finding or assessing the availability of a new roost, moving offspring to the new roost, coordinating with other group members, and meeting any increased energetic demands that may be associated with these behaviors may influence the number and duration of feeding bouts of reproductive females. To examine the influence of roost-switching on nocturnal activity patterns we radio-tagged lactating female silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) and monitored them on nights when they moved to a new roost site and nights when no roost shift occurred. The typical activity pattern on a non-move night consisted of an initial long bout away from the day roost (median length: 177.4 min) followed by alternating bouts in (50.6 min) and away (57.0 min) from the roost for the rest of the night. On move nights bats reduced the length of their first absent period (82.7 min) and increased the number of trips from the roost, although neither the length of these subsequent absent periods nor the total time absent from the roosts differed from non-move nights. Similarly, total time spent in roosts did not differ between move and non-move nights, but bats made more and shorter visits on move nights. Visits to original and new roosts were not synchronous among colony members, and the length of time for individuals from the same colony to move to a new roost varied from 1 to 4 h. Our results indicate that roost switching did not influence the total time spent in or away from day roosts. Rather, bats moved between the original roost, the new roost, and foraging areas with much greater frequency on move nights.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are a group of mammals well known for forming dynamic social groups. Studies of bat social structures are often based upon the frequency at which bats occupy the same roosts because observing bats directly is not always possible. However, it is not always clear how closely bats occupying the same roost associate with each other, obscuring whether associations result from social relationships or factors such as shared preferences for roosts. Our goal was to determine if bats cohabitating buildings were also found together inside roosts by using anti-­collision technology for PIT tags, which enables simultaneous detection of multiple tags. We PIT-­tagged 293 female little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) and installed antennas within two buildings used as maternity roosts in Yellowstone National Park. Antennas were positioned at roost entryways to generate cohabitation networks and along regions of attic ceilings in each building to generate intraroost networks based on proximity of bats to each other. We found that intraroost and cohabitation networks of buildings were significantly correlated, with the same bats tending to be linked in both networks, but that bats cohabitating the same building often roosted apart, leading to differing assessments of social structure. Cohabitation rates implied that bats associate with a greater number of their roost-­mates than was supported by observations within the roost. This caused social networks built upon roost cohabitation rates to be denser, smaller in diameter, and contain nodes with higher average degree centrality. These results show that roost cohabitation does not reflect preference for roost-­mates in little brown myotis, as is often inferred from similar studies, and that social network analyses based on cohabitation may provide misleading results.",

            "abstractNote": "The lesser short-tailed bat (Mystacina tuberculata) and the long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) are Aotearoa New Zealand’s only native extant terrestrial mammals and are believed to have migrated from Australia. Long-tailed bats arrived in New Zealand an estimated two million years ago and are closely related to other Australian bat species. Lesser short-tailed bats, in contrast, are the only extant species within the Mystacinidae and are estimated to have been living in isolation in New Zealand for the past 16–18 million years. Throughout this period of isolation, lesser short-tailed bats have become one of the most terrestrial bats in the world. Through a metatranscriptomic analysis of guano samples from eight locations across New Zealand, we aimed to characterise the viromes of New Zealand’s bats and determine whether viruses have jumped between these species over the past two million years. High viral richness was observed among long-tailed bats with viruses spanning seven different viral families. In contrast, no bat-specific viruses were identified in lesser short-tailed bats. Both bat species harboured an abundance of likely dietary- and environment-associated viruses. We also identified alphacoronaviruses in long-tailed bat guano that had previously been identified in lesser short-tailed bats, suggesting that these viruses had jumped the species barrier after long-tailed bats migrated to New Zealand. Of note, an alphacoronavirus species discovered here possessed a complete genome of only 22,416 nucleotides with entire deletions or truncations of several non-structural proteins, thereby representing what may be the shortest genome within the Coronaviridae identified to date. Overall, this study has revealed a diverse range of novel viruses harboured by New Zealand’s only native terrestrial mammals, in turn expanding our understanding of bat viral dynamics and evolution globally.",

The genome is found to be 17,531 bp in length and has a base composition of A (33.8%), G (13.2%), C (23.2%), and T (29.8%). Similar to other bats, it contains a typically conserved structure including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 1 control region (D-loop). Most of the genes are encoded on H-strand, except for the ND6 subunit gene and 8 tRNA genes. All protein-coding genes start with an ATG codon except for ND2, ND3 and ND5, which initiate with ATT or ATA instead, and terminate with the typical stop codon (TAA/TAG) or a single T (T–) or an unexpected codon of AGA. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence provided here would be useful for further phylogenetic analysis and population genetic studies in M. davidii.",

Bats are the only native land dwelling mammals on this archipelago, but the biogeographical origins for the vast majority of species within this group are ambiguous. We report here genetic analyses based on two mitochondrial DNA markers to infer the origin of Comorian bats belonging to a reputed species complex of Miniopterus that is further distributed across Africa and Madagascar. Phylogenetic reconstructions show that east African M. minor are not closely related to the insular Miniopterus of Madagascar and the Comoros (Grande Comore and Anjouan). The latter cluster into two distinct, monophyletic clades (Clade 1 and Clade 2). Representatives of these clades occur sympatrically both on the Comoros and on Madagascar, and are distinguished by a large genetic distance (K2P: 9.9% for cytochrome b). No haplotypes are shared between any islands, suggesting the absence of contemporary gene flow. Populations of the widespread Clade 1 are furthermore characterized by a significant inter-island structure (FCT = 0.249), and by high haplotype and nucleotide diversities (h = 0.90–0.98, p = 0.04–0.06). Demographic analyses of Clade 1 suggest secondary contact between two distinct phylogroups (Subclade 1 A and 1B) that reached Grande Comore and Anjouan, and a large, stable population with a long evolutionary history on Madagascar. These results and the current distribution of related lineages suggest that the Comoros were colonized independently at least two or three times by ancestors from Madagascar.",

The genome is a circular molecule of 16,463 bp length, containing 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and a control region. Most of the genes were encoded on the H-strand, except for 8 tRNA and ND6 genes. Phylogenetic trees of the complete mitochondrial genome were constructed using RAxML. Our result suggests that M. cyclotis is closely related to M. leucogaster from Korea. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of M. cyclotis will be helpful for future taxonomic and phylogenetic studies on Murina.",

It is easily distinguished from other Glossophaginae because of its tricolored dorsal pelage with a dark basal band, well-furred elbow, lack of lower incisors, and wing membrane attached to the foot at about mid-length of the metatarsals. L. obscura is a foliage-roosting species, and primarily feeds on nectar and pollen. The species is rare because locally it occurs in low numbers. Despite the lack of information and low abundance, L. obscura is listed as a species of “Least Concern” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.",

            "abstractNote": "Wagner’s mustached bat (Pteronotus personatus) is an insectivorous bat distributed throughout America from Mexico to Brazil, which inhabits a range of habitats from rain forests to dry deciduous forests. There are two currently recognized species within the P. personatus complex, for which we examined 235 cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequences and 138 cytochrome b (Cytb) sequences in order to explore its genetic variation in Mexico as well as in Central and South America. Our results reveal considerable differences in the genetic structure inside this species complex, indicating five genetic lineages: 1) Gulf of Mexico and the Mexican Pacific coastal plain to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, 2) Southeastern Mexico, 3) Guatemala, 4) Guyana and Suriname-COI/Guyana and Venezuela-Cytb, and 5) Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and Brazil. In addition, we used the isolation-with-migration coalescent method to estimate divergence times. The results indicate that vicariant events occurred roughly 1,624,000–2,450,000 years ago during the Early Pleistocene, wherein Central America was the center of two separate diversification processes, one toward Mexico and the other South America. The intraspecific lineages obtained for P. personatus demonstrate the need to reevaluate the species complex limits of this taxon.",

The wingspan, wing loading and aspect ratio of the two species were relatively low, and those of T. pachypus were lower compared with T. robustula. The echolocation calls of T. pachypus and T. robustula consist of a broadband frequency modulated (FM) sweep followed by a short narrowband FM sweep. The dominant frequency of calls of T. pachypus was 65.1 kHz, whereas that of T. robustula was 57.7 kHz. The call frequencies (including highest frequency of the call, lowest frequency of the call and frequency of the call that contained most energy) of T. pachypus were higher than those of T. robustula, and the pulse duration of the former was longer than that of the latter. The inter-pulse interval and bandwidth of the calls were not signiﬁcantly different between the two species. Tylonycteris pachypus foraged in more complex environments than T. robustula, although the two species were both netted in edge habitats (around trees or houses), along pathways and in the tops of trees. Tylonycteris pachypus ﬂew slower (straight level ﬂight speed, 4.3 m sÀ1) than T. robustula (straight level ﬂight speed, 4.8 m sÀ1). We discuss the relationship between wing morphology, echolocation calls, foraging behaviour and ﬂight speed, and demonstrate resource partitioning between these two species in terms of morphological and behavioural factors.",

            "abstractNote": "Rhinolophids (horseshoe bats) are a widespread and diverse family. Their high level of morphological convergence has made taxonomic identification and estimation of species diversity problematic. The Rhinolophus philippinensis group, which is characterized with huge ears and low echolocation frequency relative to body size, is a specific group among all the rhinolophid groups, but the phylogeny of this group is poorly understood. In this study, we performed integrated analyses of the morphology, acoustic and genetic data and constructed the first multilocus phylogeny for the philippinensis group using four mitochondrial genes, four autosomal introns and one Y‐linked intron in 95 specimens representing nine taxa. Phylogenies were constructed based on concatenated phylogenetic methods and a multilocus coalescence approach. The estimated phylogenies revealed the polyphyly of the philippinensis group. Except for R. philippinensis, all the other species in this group formed a monophyletic cluster, named herewith as “R. macrotis” species group. Phylogenies, genetic and phenotypic divergence, and species delimitation analyses supported the revised status of R. paradoxolophus as a subspecies of R. rex, R. cf. macrotis as a subspecies of R. macrotis, and R. huananus and R. cf. siamensis as junior synonyms of R. siamensis. Significant discordances were found between the mitochondrial and nuclear gene trees, suggesting incomplete lineage sorting or ancient introgression events within the philippinensis group. The macrotis group appeared to have undergone a rapid radiation approximately 2.57 million years ago during the early Pleistocene period due to palaeoclimatic oscillations. Reconstruction of the ancestral ranges suggested a wide distribution of the common ancestor for the philippinensis and macrotis groups.",

The morphology, echolocation call structure, diet, and foraging areas of S. kuhlii were studied on Hainan Island, south China from March to November 2006. Data from 85 individuals indicate that S. kuhlii is a medium-sized bat with 50.41 ± 1.36 (0 ± SE) mm forearm length and 19.81 ± 3.47 g body mass. The wing morphology with high wing-loading (11.38 ± 1.95 N/m2) and moderate aspect ratio (6.96 ± 0.75) indicates that S. kuhlii flies fast and forages in open habitat and at the edges of cluttered environments. Echolocation calls of S. kuhlii consist of a fundamental and up to four harmonics, with a dominant frequency of 45.72 ± 2.09 kHz, and call shape suggests that this species is adapted to forage in open environments. Data from mist-netting and acoustic detection indicated that S. kuhlii foraged mainly around the crown of trees and street lights. Nine insect orders were recorded in its diet, with Lepidoptera (97.46%, by frequency) and Coleoptera (64.72 ± 2.37%, by volume) constituting the main prey, together with Hemiptera (19.99 ± 1.25%) and Hymenoptera (9.43 ± 1.14%). There was significant seasonal variation in the diet of S. kuhlii: Coleoptera increased from March to May, and then decreased to August, while Hemiptera and Hymenoptera showed the inverse trend.",

            "abstractNote": "Although bats are increasingly recognised as potential reservoir hosts of human zoonotic pathogens, bacteria in bats are still poorly studied. To investigate the DNA faecal prevalence of the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum, we sampled 23 lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) maternity colonies located in buildings (churches, barns) in rural villages of eastern France. A total of 552 faecal samples were collected from 278 individuals. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was detected in the faeces of 63 individuals (22.7%). Such high prevalence might suggest persistent infection in bats and/or a frequent consumption of insect preys carrying bacteria. Faecal DNA prevalence varied highly among colonies but was not related to the colony size. Faecal DNA prevalence was the highest in the Jura Department, where the density of ticks is known to be the highest across the study area. Because the sampled bats live in close proximity to humans, we discuss how concerning the presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA in bat guano is for humans frequenting places of worship that shelter bats. We also advocate future research to understand what a high faecal DNA prevalence in bat guano really implicates in terms of bacteria transmission.",

            "abstractNote": "Cross-species transmission of zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs) can result in pandemic disease outbreaks. Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), identiﬁed in 2012, has caused 182 cases to date, with ~43% mortality, and no small animal model has been reported. MERS-CoV and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus (BtCoV) strain HKU5 of Betacoronavirus (␤-CoV) subgroup 2c share >65% identity at the amino acid level in several regions, including nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are signiﬁcant drug and vaccine targets. BtCoV HKU5 has been described in silico but has not been shown to replicate in culture, thus hampering drug and vaccine studies against subgroup 2c ␤-CoVs. We report the synthetic reconstruction and testing of BtCoV HKU5 containing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein ectodomain (BtCoV HKU5-SE). This virus replicates efﬁciently in cell culture and in young and aged mice, where the virus targets airway and alveolar epithelial cells. Unlike some subgroup 2b SARS-CoV vaccines that elicit a strong eosinophilia following challenge, we demonstrate that BtCoV HKU5 and MERS-CoV N-expressing Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicon particle (VRP) vaccines do not cause extensive eosinophilia following BtCoV HKU5-SE challenge. Passage of BtCoV HKU5-SE in young mice resulted in enhanced virulence, causing 20% weight loss, diffuse alveolar damage, and hyaline membrane formation in aged mice. Passaged virus was characterized by mutations in the nsp13, nsp14, open reading frame 5 (ORF5) and M genes. Finally, we identiﬁed an inhibitor active against the nsp5 proteases of subgroup 2c ␤-CoVs. Synthetic-genome platforms capable of reconstituting emerging zoonotic viral pathogens or their phylogenetic relatives provide new strategies for identifying broad-based therapeutics, evaluating vaccine outcomes, and studying viral pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE The 2012 outbreak of MERS-CoV raises the specter of another global epidemic, similar to the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic. MERS-CoV is related to BtCoV HKU5 in target regions that are essential for drug and vaccine testing. Because no small animal model exists to evaluate MERS-CoV pathogenesis or to test vaccines, we constructed a recombinant BtCoV HKU5 that expressed a region of the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein, thereby allowing the recombinant virus to grow in cell culture and in mice. We show that this recombinant virus targets airway epithelial cells and causes disease in aged mice. We use this platform to (i) identify a broad-spectrum antiviral that can potentially inhibit viruses closely related to MERS-CoV, (ii) demonstrate the absence of increased eosinophilic immune pathology for MERS-CoV N protein-based vaccines, and (iii) mouse adapt this virus to identify viral genetic determinants of cross-species transmission and virulence. This study holds signiﬁcance as a strategy to control newly emerging viruses.",

            "abstractNote": "Ecological niche models have become very popular for analysing the potential distribution of species. Nevertheless, models are strongly inﬂuenced by many factors, such as spatial resolution, environmental variables and the quality of distribution records. In this paper, we evaluated how ecological niche models changed with the addition of records accumulated over four decades. Our model species was the stripe-headed round-eared bat (Tonatia saurophila). Thus, with data organized in chronological order, we could observe how the models changed in predicting distributions over time in comparison with all known point locations.We tested if partial models could predict the occurrence of new unpublished records for savannah areas in central Brazil, considering that the species is typically associated with forest environments. Our results indicate a high omission rate for models built with point localities from the 1970s and 1980s (58.5% and 50.0% of all known points respectively), and predicted that the species could occur in central Brazil. Although T. saurophila has indeed been recorded recently in central Brazil, it was found in places different from those predicted by the models using these restricted earlier data. Nevertheless, the environmental suitability of such areas is signiﬁcantly different from sites largely described in earlier records from the Amazonia region, as shown by principal components analysis. We argue that populations of T. saurophila that occupy open habitats in central South America (including Caatinga, Cerrado, Chaco and semi-deciduous interior forests) deserve further study at the genetic level to determine if bats in these very different habitats are taxonomically distinct from Amazonian populations. Our results also suggest that models based on very limited datasets for species occurrence can lead conservationists or decision makers to wrong conclusions.",

In bats, the cost of ﬂight makes locomotion energetically demanding. These mammalian groups may represent three independent evolutionary origins of an energy-demanding lifestyle in mammals. IDH2 encodes an enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the mitochondrion, which plays a key role in aerobic energy metabolism. In this study, we cloned and sequenced this gene in two cetaceans, and 19 bat species, and compared the data with available primate sequences to test its evolution. We found signiﬁcant signals of parallel evolution in this gene among these three groups. Parallel evolution of this gene may reﬂect their parallel evolution towards a higher demand for energy.",

            "abstractNote": "We have carried out a first research on habitat selection in Rhinolophus euryale with the aim of assessing if landscape changes may be involved in the current decline of this species. During May 2000 nine bats were tagged with small radio-transmitters, in a spring colony in Urdaibai Biosphere Reserve (Basque Country). We gathered a total of 133 locations in 23 tracking nights. Every night each bat moved to an individual feeding area, travelling as far as 10 km from the roost. Meadows were avoided. Forests were used extensively, where bats flew both along forest edges or within the canopy. Pine plantations were negatively selected with 25 % of fixes gathered in pine wood. Native deciduous forests and eucalyptus plantations were selected positively. The scarcity of deciduous woods, the intense use of exotic plantations, and the extremely large foraging radius suggest that the studied area is a suboptimal landscape for the species.",

Wild caught bats underwent sedation, intracardial perfusion, necropsy and histopathology. All 15 wild-caught African fruit bats were apparently healthy. However, light microscopy revealed mild oligofocal tubulonephrosis with intraluminal deposi­ tion of polarizing crystals interpreted as subclinical oxalate nephrosis in one case. In summary, we suggest a dietary aetiology, based on seasonal availability of high ascorbic acid or oxalate containing fruits. However, exposure to anthropogenic contaminants cannot be completely ruled out.",

To determine whether differences exist in bat flight behaviour, prey handling and echolocation characteristics when catching fish and insects of different size, we conducted a field experiment focused on the last stage of prey capture. We used synchronized video and ultrasound recordings to measure several flight and dip features as well as echolocation characteristics, focusing on terminal buzz phase I, characterized by a call rate exceeding 100 Hz, and buzz phase II, characterized by a drop in the fundamental well below 20 kHz and a repetition rate exceeding 150 Hz. When capturing insects, bats used both parts of the terminal phase to the same extent, and performed short and superficial drags on the water surface. In contrast, when preying on fish, buzz I was longer and buzz II shorter, and the bats made longer and deeper dips. These variations suggest that lengthening buzz I and shortening buzz II when fishing is beneficial, probably because buzz I gives better discrimination ability and the broader sonar beam provided by buzz II is useless when no evasive flight of the prey is expected. Additionally, bats continued emitting calls beyond the theoretical signal-overlap zone, suggesting that they might obtain information even when they have surpassed that threshold, at least initially. This study shows that M. capaccinii can regulate the temporal components of its feeding buzzes and modify prey capture technique according to the target.",

            "abstractNote": "In order to compare the effectiveness of diurnal and nocturnal pollinators, we studied the reproductive biology and pollinators of Tillandsia heterophylla E. Morren, an epiphytic tank bromeliad endemic to southeastern Mexico. Since anthesis in T. heterophylla is predominantly nocturnal but lasts until the following day, we hypothesised that this bromeliad would receive visits from both diurnal and nocturnal visitors, but that nocturnal visitors would be the most effective pollinators, since they arrive ﬁrst to the receptive ﬂower, and that bats would be the most frequent nocturnal visitors, given the characteristics of the nectar. Flowering of T. heterophylla began in May and lasted until July. The species is fully self-compatible, with an anthesis that lasts for ca. 15–16 h. Mean volume of nectar produced per ﬂower was 82.21 ll, with a mean sugar concentration of 6.33%. The highest volume and concentration of nectar were found at 20:00 h, with a subsequent decline in both to almost zero over the following 12-h period. T. heterophylla has a generalist pollination system, since at least four different morphospecies of visitors pollinate its ﬂowers: bats, moths, hummingbirds and bees. Most of the pollinating visits corresponded to bats and took place in the early evening, when stigma receptivity had already begun; making bats the probable pollinator on most occasions. However, diurnal pollinators may be important as a ‘fail-safe’ system by which to guarantee the pollination of T. heterophylla.",

Animals studied A total of 36 bats belonging to three different species (Desmodus rotundus, Diameus youngi, and Artibeus lituratus) were used to perform this investigation. Thirteen Diameus youngi and six Desmodus rotundus were trapped in a cave, and 17 captive Artibeus lituratus were obtained from an experimental colony. Both free-ranging and captive bats were free of apparent ocular or systemic disease. Procedures Corneal and conjunctival swabs were collected from both eyes to identify the resident bacterial microbiota.\nResults Seventeen bats had positive bacterial cultures in one or both eyes. Considering all isolates, Gram-positive bacteria (82.6%) predominated over those that were Gramnegative bacteria (17.4%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci (30.4%) were the most isolated genus, followed by Bacillus spp. (26%) and Corynebacterium spp. (21%). Only four Gram-negative species were isolated: Shigella spp., Hafnia alvei, Morganella morganii, and Flavobacterium odoratum.\nConclusions In this study, bacterial microbiota of the ocular surface of bats was described, and Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated type of microorganism from healthy bat eyes.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Hibernation, a survival strategy in mammals for extreme climates, induces physiological phenomena such as ischemia–reperfusion and metabolic shifts that hold great potential for advancements in modern medicine. Despite this, the molecular mechanisms underpinning hibernation remain largely unclear. This study used RNA‐seq and Iso‐seq techniques to investigate the changes in liver transcriptome expression of\n              Rhinolophus pusillus\n              during hibernation and active periods, as well as under different microhabitat temperatures. We identified 11 457 differentially expressed genes during hibernation and active periods, of which 395 showed significant differential expression. Genes associated with fatty acid catabolism were significantly upregulated during hibernation, whereas genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and glycogen synthesis were downregulated. Conversely, immune‐related genes displayed differential expression patterns: genes tied to innate immunity were significantly upregulated, while those linked to adaptive immunity and inflammatory response were downregulated. The analysis of transcriptomic data obtained from different microhabitat temperatures revealed that\n              R. pusillus\n              exhibited an upregulation of genes associated with lipid metabolism in lower microhabitat temperature. This upregulation facilitated an enhanced utilization rate of triglyceride, ultimately resulting in increased energy provision for the organism. Additionally,\n              R. pusillus\n              upregulated gluconeogenesis‐related genes regardless of the microhabitat temperature, demonstrating the importance of maintaining blood glucose levels during hibernation. Our transcriptomic data reveal that these changes in liver gene expression optimize energy allocation during hibernation, suggesting that liver tissue adaptively responds to the inherent stress of its function during hibernation. This study sheds light on the role of differential gene expression in promoting more efficient energy allocation during hibernation. It contributes to our understanding of how liver tissue adapts to the stressors associated with this state.",

Artiﬁcial selection for increased resistance to the acute toxic effects of cadmium was performed, and after eight generations, the average median effective concentration increased from 61 to 180 ␮g/L. No differences in life span, offspring production, time to ﬁrst brood, number of offspring in the ﬁrst brood, or intrinsic rate of population increase (r) were observed between the cadmiumadapted population and the controls under ideal conditions or under conditions of temperature or feeding ration stress, but cadmiumadapted daphnids were smaller. Control and cadmium-adapted populations were equally sensitive to copper and malathion, but the cadmium-adapted population was less sensitive to lead and more sensitive to phenol. Analysis of ampliﬁed fragment-length polymorphisms indicated a signiﬁcant decrease in genetic diversity in the cadmium-adapted population. Although the evolved cadmium resistance would allow adapted populations to exist in areas where cadmium concentrations would be toxic to unadapted populations, the decreased genetic diversity, smaller size, and increased sensitivity to at least one other toxicant could reduce the probability of long-term survival even in the absence of future cadmium exposure.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging disease of hibernating bats associated with cutaneous infection by the fungus\n              Geomyces destructans\n              (\n              Gd\n              ), and responsible for devastating declines of bat populations in eastern North America. Affected bats appear emaciated and one hypothesis is that they spend too much time out of torpor during hibernation, depleting vital fat reserves required to survive the winter. The fungus has also been found at low levels on bats throughout Europe but without mass mortality. This finding suggests that\n              Gd\n              is either native to both continents but has been rendered more pathogenic in North America by mutation or environmental change, or that it recently arrived in North America as an invader from Europe. Thus, a causal link between\n              Gd\n              and mortality has not been established and the reason for its high pathogenicity in North America is unknown. Here we show that experimental inoculation with either North American or European isolates of\n              Gd\n              causes WNS and mortality in the North American bat,\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              . In contrast to control bats, individuals inoculated with either isolate of\n              Gd\n              developed cutaneous infections diagnostic of WNS, exhibited a progressive increase in the frequency of arousals from torpor during hibernation, and were emaciated after 3–4 mo. Our results demonstrate that altered torpor-arousal cycles underlie mortality from WNS and provide direct evidence that\n              Gd\n              is a novel pathogen to North America from Europe.",

While searching and hunting for prey, bats experience sonar interference, not only from densely cluttered environments, but also from calls of conspecifics foraging in close proximity. Previous work has shown that when two bats compete for a single prey item in a relatively open environment, one of the bats may go silent for extended periods of time, which can serve to minimize sonar interference between conspecifics. Additionally, pairs of big brown bats have been shown to adjust frequency characteristics of their vocalizations to avoid acoustic interference in echo processing. In this study, we extended previous work by examining how the presence of conspecifics <i>and</i> environmental clutter influence the bat's echolocation behavior. By recording multichannel audio and video data of bats engaged in insect capture in open and cluttered spaces, we quantified the bats' vocal and flight behaviors. Big brown bats flew individually and in pairs in an open and cluttered room, and the results of this study shed light on the different strategies that this species employs to negotiate a complex and dynamic environment.",

Using a combination of observations and experiments we compared the effectiveness of introduced honeybees with that of hummingbirds, native bees and moths on both the male and female components of ﬁtness of the Andean shrub Duranta mandonii (Verbenaceae). Our results demonstrated signiﬁcant variation among ﬂower visitors in rates of visitation, pollen removal ability and contribution to fruit set. This variation was not always correlated; that is, taxa that regularly visited ﬂowers did not remove the most pollen or contribute to fruit set. Despite the taxonomic diversity of visitors, the main natural pollinators of this shrub are large native bees, such as Bombus spp. Introduced honeybees were found to be as effective as native bees at pollinating this species. Duranta mandonii has high apparent generalization, but low realized generalization and can be considered to be a moderate ecological generalist (a number of species of large bees provide pollination services), but a functional specialist (most pollinators belong to a single functional group). The present study has highlighted the importance of measuring efﬁciency components when documenting plant–pollinator interactions, and has also demonstrated that visitation rates may give little insight into the relative importance of ﬂower visitors.",

Total counts of bats at three identified roosts varied from 7,000 to 48,000 individuals. The bats moved between roosts within the same general area, probably reflecting seasonal variation in the availability of preferred foods and/or harassment and direct persecution at some roost sites by the rural community. Our study suggests that tree density and number of branches on trees were important factors in roost site selection for E. helvum, and the removal of roost trees has serious ramifications for their conservation in the region. Germination experiments and observations at roost sites indicated that E. helvum consumed fruits from 31 plant species of 16 families, potentially assisting in the dispersal of their seeds. Further monitoring is needed to provide a complete picture of the status and migration patterns of E. helvum in Kenya. Additionally, because the bats were viewed negatively and persecuted by roost tree clearance and direct eradication attempts, an education and community outreach programme in local schools and communities is proposed for the long-term conservation of viable populations of E. helvum in western Kenya.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are particularly susceptible to environmental changes because of their low reproductive rate, longevity, and high metabolic rates, which lead to relatively high food requirements. Thus, bat populations take a relatively long time to recover from increased mortality rates, and monitoring schemes should cover long time periods. In this work, we analyzed the population trajectories of two bat species, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Myotis myotis, the most numerous in five caves in southern Poland, which are known as important bat hibernacula on a continental scale. Data were collected by regular counts in 1985–2020, depending on the particular cave; in addition, previous data on the number of hibernating bats in these caves, available since 1951, were taken from existing publications. We analyzed time-series data using average locality indices and TRIM (TRends and Indices for Monitoring data) methods, and both produced similar results. Generally, the populations of the two studied bat species showed recent increasing trends, especially visible as an effect of recovery after years of decline. The situation recorded in southern Poland is very similar to that described in other places in Europe, where recoveries of bat populations have also been observed in the last decades. Although it is difficult to present results from formal analyses, because of the lack of good data, at least some factors—less exposure to contaminants (pesticides, heavy metals), improving food availability due to climate change, and a lower predation rate (including human pressure), both in the breeding season and during wintering—positively affected both species.",

To determine their nutritional value, both as a group and for individual species, we analyzed 14 fig species from Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama, for fiber, tannins, lipids, protein, carbohydrates, amino acids, and minerals. Seeds and pulp were analyzed separately. Fig fruit pulp consisted of about one-third digestible components, mostly carbohydrateswith some lipids and proteins. Tannin, lignin, and water-soluble carbohydrates showed considerablevariation among species, as did fruit size. Figs contained high amounts of amino acids, such as leucine, lysine, valine, and arginine, and minerals, such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, and phosphorus. One species, Ficus insipida, contained the highest concentrations of almost all amino acids, many minerals, and protein. Small figs had as much nutritional value per gram as large figs. Free-standing figs had higher percentages of protein, complex carbohydrates, and ash than strangler figs., which had higher percentages of water-soluble carbohydrates, tannins, and hemicellulose. The guild of fruiteating bats on BCI included ten common species with diets dominated by figs. Fecal analyses and captures at ripe fig trees showed a consistent pattern of resource partitioning. Small bats preferentially ate small-fruited and strangler figs while large bats consumed mostly large-fruited and free-standing figs. Small bats most oken ate E: bullenei, which has high levels of lipid and carbohydrates, and F yoponensis, which has high levels of protein. Medium and large bats most often ate E insipida, a nutritionally superior species; their second most eaten species was E: obtusifolia, in which the large size may make it efficient to eat. Each bat ate a variety of fig species, supporting the idea that although no single species of fig may be sufficient to sustain frugivores, a mix of fig species can provide a complete set of nutrients.",

With an expected higher copulation rate, harem males may deplete seminal fluids or increase epididymal sperm maturation, generating poor sperm quality. In a first study, we reported a higher sperm quality in sneaker males of Carollia perspicillata. To test whether the lower sperm quality observed in harem males was generated by an elevated copulation rate, we temporarily removed males of both social statuses from the colony. We thus assessed status-related changes of sperm quality resulting from sexual abstinence. Moreover, released from territory and female guarding, harem males were expected to show a reduction in somatic costs. On the basis of sperm competition models, we predicted a higher resource investment in the ejaculate with the reduction of pre-copulatory efforts. In line with our predictions, sperm quality of harem males improved significantly in contrast to sneaker males, whose sperm quality did not change. Without an increase in ejaculate lipid peroxidation, our results also provide evidence that the duration of sexual abstinence was not sufficient to generate sperm oxidative damage through senescence. Harem males did not show a reduction in blood lipid peroxidation or in the ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione. In line with the maintenance of these somatic costs, harem males did not invest more superoxide dismutase to the ejaculate to maintain sperm quality. Our results suggest that a difference in copulation rate rather than an adaptation to sperm competition provides sneaker males with higher sperm quality in C. perspicillata.",

We examined the distributions of Myotis lucifugus (little brown myotis), Myotis septentrionalis (northern long-eared myotis), and Perimyotis subflavus (tri-colored bat) in eastern Nebraska by setting acoustic detectors for a single night at 105 sites in wooded habitats during summers of 2012 and 2014. We compared 2 methods of determining presence at each site. Results of our analyses are fine-scale distributional maps for these bats and some range extensions from published records. Results for M. septentrionalis and P. subflavus are largely consistent with previous reports. Results for M. lucifugus vary depending on the method of determining presence; however, our preferred method creates a pattern consistent with the known vouchered distribution of this species. The differences between published distributions of these species and distributions based on acoustic detection from our study might result from a lack of extensive netting in many areas of eastern Nebraska, underrepresentation of P. subflavus from mist net surveys in Nebraska, and a recent westward range expansion of P. subflavus and M. septentrionalis in southern Nebraska.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) has claimed the lives of millions of hibernating insectivorous bats in North America. Its etiologic agent, the psychrophilic fungus Geomyces destructans, causes skin lesions that are the hallmark of the disease. The fungal infection is characterized by a white powdery growth on muzzle, ears and wing membranes. While WNS may threaten some species of North American bats with regional extinction, infection in hibernating bats in Europe seems not to be associated with significant mortality. We performed histopathological investigations on biopsy samples of 11 hibernating European bats, originating from 4 different countries, colonized by G. destructans. One additional bat was euthanized to allow thorough examination of multiple strips of its wing membranes. Molecular analyses of touch imprints, swabs and skin samples confirmed that fungal structures were G. destructans. Additionally, archived field notes on hibernacula monitoring data in the Harz Mountains, Germany, over an 11-year period (2000-2011) revealed multiple capture-recapture events of 8 banded bats repeatedly displaying characteristic fungal colonization. Skin lesions of G. destructans-affected hibernating European bats are intriguingly similar to the epidermal lesions described in North American bats. Nevertheless, deep invasion of fungal hyphae into the dermal connective tissue with resulting ulceration like in North American bats was not observed in the biopsy samples of European bats; all lesions found were restricted to the layers of the epidermis and its adnexae. Two bats had mild epidermal cupping erosions as described for North American bats. The possible mechanisms for any difference in outcomes of G. destructans infection in European and North American bats still need to be elucidated.",

            "abstractNote": "Habitat modification can improve outcomes for imperilled wildlife. Insectivorous bats in North America face a range of conservation threats, including habitat loss and white-nose syndrome (WNS). Even healthy bats face energetic constraints during spring, but enhancement of roosting habitat could reduce energetic costs, increase survival and enhance recovery from WNS. We tested the potential of artificial heating of bat roosts as a management tool for threatened bat populations. We predicted that: (i) after hibernation, captive bats would be more likely to select a roost maintained at a temperature near their thermoneutral zone; (ii) bats recovering from WNS at the end of hibernation would show a stronger preference for heated roosts compared with healthy bats; and (iii) heated roosts would result in biologically significant energy savings. We housed two groups of bats (WNS-positive and control) in separate flight cages following hibernation. Over 7.5 weeks, we quantified the presence of individuals in heated vs. unheated bat houses within each cage. We then used a series of bioenergetic models to quantify thermoregulatory costs in each type of roost under a number of scenarios. Bats preferentially selected heated bat houses, but WNS-affected bats were much more likely to use the heated bat house compared with control animals. Our model predicted energy savings of up to 81.2% for bats in artificially heated roosts if roost temperature was allowed to cool at night to facilitate short bouts of torpor. Our results are consistent with research highlighting the importance of roost microclimate and suggest that protection and enhancement of high-quality, natural roosting environments should be a priority response to a range of threats, including WNS. Our findings also suggest the potential of artificially heated bat houses to help populations recover from WNS, but more work is needed before these might be implemented on a large scale.",

The islands of Anatahan, Pagan, and Agrihan had the largest populations, with minimum population estimates Of 3,000, 2,500, and 1,000 bats, respectively. Smaller populations of about 400-1,000 fruit bats occurred on Asuncion, Guguan, Rota, and Guam. The remaining islands in the archipelago were each estimated to have fewer than 125 bats. Population densities of fruit bats were highest on islands with little hunting but were generally much lower on human-inhabited islands where hunting was common.",

Our investigation into intersexual feeding habits of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) revealed different feeding strategies between males and females. Contrary to our predictions, there was no significant difference in time of emergence between males and females, and males and females foraged for equal lengths of time. Temperature influenced length of foraging bouts of both sexes. Female bats exhibited site fidelity within the river valley close to the colonies. Males foraged over larger areas than did females, and spent significantly more time away from the main feeding area than did females. We conclude that the areas in which males foraged were of lower quality or required longer commuting distances, thus requiring males to forage for as long as females.",

Although these changes are well known, the longterm ecological effects of new species and their interactions are seldom considered and rarely documented. This study examines changes in diversity and temporal availability of the food resources of Pteropus poliocephalus (Greyheaded Flying-fox) in the Melbourne region using a variety of historical and current data sources. Our results indicate that urbanization has inﬂuenced the distribution, abundance and ecology of P. poliocephalus through a dramatic increase in the quantity and temporal availability of food resources. Prior to European settlement, only 13 species recorded in the range-wide diet of P. poliocephalus grew in the Melbourne area. Compilations of streettree databases indicate that an additional 87 species have been planted on Melbourne’s streets and that there are at least 315 500 trees that are able to provide food for P. poliocephalus. Phenology records indicate that street trees have lengthened the temporal availability of food for P. poliocephalus. A period of natural food scarcity between May and August has been ameliorated by street trees which have provided nectar and a previously absent fruit resource. These changes are likely to be a major factor contributing to the recent range expansion of P. poliocephalus and the establishment of a permanent camp in Melbourne.",

Using radio telemetry, we obtained empirical evidence of roosting activity for Little Brown Myotis on the north coast of British Columbia. One non-reproductive adult female and 2 adult male Little Brown Myotis were found to use 4 unique roosting locations in the Prince Rupert area. Three of 4 confirmed roost sites were located in anthropogenic structures, including an industrial warehouse and two 2-story houses. The 4th roost was located in a cedar hedge on a residential property. Roosts were located within 890 to 1140 m of capture sites, which were sited in suitable bat foraging habitat. One male bat re-used the same daytime roost for the duration of the study period, whereas a 2nd male selected 2 different roost locations during the study. Despite the potential limitation of the small sample size of this telemetry study, our findings contribute to the understanding of roosts used by Little Brown Myotis on the north coast of British Columbia, and provide a basis for future directed studies and conservation efforts.",

The adhesive discs on thumbs and soles of bats of the family Thyropteridae are uniquely specialized for this purpose, hut their functional organization remains virtually unexplored. The face of the discs is concave, has a characteristic dermatoglyphic pattern, and is permanently moist. Each disc is supported by a biconcaval fibrocartilagenous framework; its circular “rim” is divided into 60-80 chambers, each accommodating a sudoriparous gland which discharges on the disc face. Glandular form and cytology are unique, reflecting special functional adaptations. Other significant adaptations involve the epidermis, distribution of adipose tissue, extrinsic muscle insertions, disc relations to digital joints, and distribution of certain sensory endings. The discs have no intrinsic musculature and are manipulated from without. Experiments with living Thyroptera and analysis of the internal organization of the discs verify that their functional mode is suctorial rather than some other adhesive mechanisms; special relationships within the thumb discs suggest that the adhesive force may be to some extent adjustable under normal use.",

            "abstractNote": "Summary Glossophagine nectar-feeding bats exploit ﬂowers while hovering in front of them. Aerodynamic theory predicts that power output for hovering ﬂight in Glossophaga soricina is 2.6 times higher than during horizontal ﬂight. We tested this prediction by measuring rates of gas exchange during hoverfeeding. Five individuals of Glossophaga soricina (mean mass 11.7 g) were trained to feed from a nectar dispenser designed as a ﬂow-through respirometry mask. Single hover-feeding events lasted for up to 4.5 s. Measured rates of .gas excha.nge varied as a function of hovering duration. VO2 and VCO2 during short hovering events (up to 1 s) were 20.5±6.7 ml g−1 h−1 (N=55) and 21.6±5.6 ml g−1 h−1 (N=39) (means ± S.D.), respectively. These values are in the range of a previous estimate of the metabolic power input for level forward ﬂight (23.8 ml O2 g−1 h−1). However, during hovering events lasting longer than 3 s, oxygen uptake was only 16.7±3.5 ml g−1 h−1 (N=73), which is only 70 % of the value expected for forward ﬂight. Thus, bats reduced their rate of oxygen uptake during longer periods of hovering compared with level forward ﬂight. This result is in contrast to the predicted hovering cost derived from aerodynamic theory. The exact metabolic power input during hovering remains uncertain. During longer hovering events, bats were probably not in respiratory steady state, as indicated by the deviation of the respiratory exchange ratio from the expected value of 1 (oxidization of nectar sugar) to the measured value of 0.8.",

            "abstractNote": "Flying-foxes (Pteropodidae) show a high rate of island endemism, but island-endemic taxa have shown a high rate of decline and extinction, mostly because their small population sizes are susceptible to hunting pressure and habitat loss. The Christmas Island flying-fox is restricted to the 135 km2 Christmas Island (Indian Ocean), as either an endemic species Pteropus natalis or a markedly distinct subspecies of Pteropus melanotus. Given recent declines and extinctions of other native vertebrate species on this Island, this study sought to monitor population trends for this taxon. Monitoring flying-foxes at roost sites is difficult because they are highly vagile, not all roost sites may be known to observers, and dense vegetation at some sites may make counts inaccurate. These constraints are particularly evident on Christmas Island. In this study, we sought to establish a monitoring program complementary to roost counts, and to assess changes in reporting rate from a baseline sampling of 107 sites spaced across the Island in 2006 to a repeat sampling of those sites in 2012. Every site was visited four times, at night, over a period of 4–6 weeks in June–July of 2006 and of 2012, and observers reported whether or not they heard or saw flying-foxes around the sample site. A reporting incidence measure (varying from 0 to 4) was derived for every site. This measure showed a significant decline (of 39%) between the 2006 and 2012 sampling. The observed rate of decline suggests that this taxon is of considerable conservation concern, and merits further conservation action: indeed in 2014 its Australian conservation status was changed from not listed to Critically Endangered. The cause of the current decline is not yet known, but this study indicates that factors additional to hunting and habitat loss may affect island flying-fox species.",

Since the first cases were recorded, WNS has spread rapidly across North America and is now confirmed or suspected in 40 US states and seven Canadian provinces. Often, the presence of P. destructans is detected in a cave or hibernaculum before signs of WNS manifest in the resident bat population, making presence of the fungus a more reliable assessment of potential epidemic spread than expansion of manifested WNS. An analysis of 43 cave internal climates across the state of Texas revealed a pattern of thermal suitability for P. destructans that correlated significantly with landscape (elevation, lithology) and external climate (mean surface temperature and precipitation). We generated a predictive model to assess the potential spread of P. destructans through Texas karst systems based on external features that correlate with suitable internal climates for fungal growth. Applications of this model to external climatic variables from 2019 showed seasonally varying patterns of suitability for fungal growth in select regions of Texas karst systems. Results from these surveys and models showed that internal climates of Texas caves are likely able to sustain the growth of P. destructans and could cause disease and resulting declines in Texas bats, and act as stepping-stones for the fungus, allowing it to travel southward into Mexican and Central American cave systems. The resulting work will inform researchers and natural resource managers of areas of significant concern to monitor for the spread of WNS.",

Microsatellite loci were developed for the taxonomic and population genetic assessment of the Australian complex of this species. Of the 33 primer sets designed for this research, seven (21%) were deemed suitably polymorphic for population-level analyses of the Australian taxa, with ﬁve (71%) of these loci revealing moderate to high levels of polymorphism (PIC = 0.56 to 0.91). The cross-taxa utility of the M. schreibersii microsatellite markers was assessed in the microbat (Chiroptera) family Miniopteridae. Sub-species and species covering the Miniopteridae’s global distribution (with the exception of the Middle East) were selected, numbering 25 taxa in total. Ampliﬁcation was successful for 26 loci, of which 20 (77%) were polymorphic. High cross-taxa utility of markers was observed with ampliﬁcation achieved for all taxa for between four (20%) and 20 (100%) loci, and polymorphism was considered moderate to high (PIC = 0.47–0.91) for 12 (60%) of these loci. The high cross-taxa utility of the microsatellites reported herein reveal versatile and cost-effective molecular markers, contributing an important genetic resource for the research and conservation of Miniopteridae species worldwide.",

A total of 14 370 prey items were brought home by 986 cats living in 618 households. Mammals made up 69% of the items, birds 24%, amphibians 4%, reptiles 1%, ﬁsh <1%, invertebrates 1% and unidentiﬁed items 1%. A minimum of 44 species of wild bird, 20 species of wild mammal, four species of reptile and three species of amphibian were recorded. 2. Of a sample of 696 individual cats, 634 (91%) brought home at least one item and the back-transformed mean number of items brought home was 11.3 (95% CI 10.4–12.2). The back-transformed means and number of cats retrieving at least one item from each prey group were: 8.1 (7.4–8.9) mammals for 547 (79%) cats, 4.1 (3.8–4.5) birds for 506 (73%) cats, 2.6 (2.2–3.0) herpetofauna for 145 (21%) cats and 2.2 (1.8–2.7) other items for 98 (14%) cats. 3. The number of birds and herpetofauna brought home per cat was signiﬁcantly lower in households that provided food for birds. The number of bird species brought home was greater in households providing bird food. The number of birds and herpetofauna brought home per cat was negatively related to the age and condition of the cat. The number of mammals brought home per cat was signiﬁcantly lower when cats were equipped with bells and when they were kept indoors at night. The number of herpetofauna brought home was signiﬁcantly greater when cats were kept in at night. 4. Based on the proportion of cats bringing home at least one prey item and the backtransformed means, a British population of approximately 9 million cats was estimated to have brought home in the order of 92 (85–100) million prey items in the period of this survey, including 57 (52–63) million mammals, 27 (25–29) million birds and 5 (4–6) million reptiles and amphibians. 5. An experimental approach should be taken to investigate the factors found by this descriptive survey to inﬂuence the numbers of prey brought home by cats. In particular, investigation of potential management practices that could reduce the numbers of wild animals killed and brought home by cats will be useful for wildlife conservation, particularly in suburban areas.",

All M. robusta were larger than any M. tuberculata and differed in shape of teeth, as measured by lengths and widths, and also had relatively smaller wing elements given other size differences. The population of M. tuberculata on Codfish Island comprises significantly larger individuals, as indicated by maxillary teeth measurements, than the late Holocene population of M. tuberculata in northern South Island. Such a latitudinal trend is the opposite of that known for M. robusta. The differences in adjacent populations and the different morphological response of the two taxa with latitude strongly support the distinction of M. robusta and M. tuberculata at a species level. These data suggest that skeletal data have more discriminatory power than external measurement data for assessing interpopulation or intertaxon variation in short-tailed bats.",

However, the complex ecology of most long-lived species and the consequent uncertainties in model assumptions means that effective population size estimates are often imprecise. Although methods exist to incorporate age structure into Ne estimations for long-lived species with overlapping generations, they are rarely used owing to the lack of relevant information for most wild populations. Here, we performed a case study on an elusive woodland bat, Myotis bechsteinii, to compare the use of the parentage assignment Ne estimator (EPA) with the more commonly used linkage disequilibrium (LD) Ne estimator in detecting long-term population trends, and assessed the impacts of deploying different overall sample sizes. We used genotypic data from a previously published study, and simulated 48 contrasting demographic scenarios over 150 years using the life history characteristics of this species The LD method strongly outperformed the EPA method. As expected, smaller sample sizes resulted in a reduced ability to detect population trends. Nevertheless, even the smallest sample size tested (n = 30) could detect important changes (60%–80% decline) with the LD method. These results demonstrate that genetic approaches can be an effective way to monitor long-lived species, such as bats, provided that they are undertaken over multiple decades.",

Libraries of echolocation calls provide huge potential resources for bat species identifications, ecological studies and conservation surveys. Here, the echolocation calls of two morphologically similar bat species (Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus fuliginosus) were recorded and described in order to characterize vocal signatures for field identification in China. Both M. magnater and M. fuliginosus emitted short frequency modulated echolocation calls with narrow bandwidths. Each call of the former species included two harmonics, with the first harmonic being the strongest, whereas calls of the latter species normally contained one harmonic. Although call durations were similar between the two species, there were significant differences in start, end and peak frequencies between M. magnater and M. fuliginous. The results showed that 92.3% of all calls recorded in China were attributed to the correct species based on spectral features of echolocation calls. We concluded that echolocation calls are valuable characters for the identification of morphologically similar bat species.",

The results indicated that R. pusillus (including calidus, parcus, and szechuanus) in the continental region and Hainan Island of China and “R. cornutus” in Japan are morphologically divergent species. Rhinolophus cornutus should be further split into R. cornutus (including orii, pumilus, and miyakonis) in the main islands of Japan, the Amami and Okinawa Group of the central Ryukyu Archipelago, and Miyako Group of the southern Ryukyus; and R. perditus and R. imaizumii from the Yaeyama Group in the southern Ryukyus. Rhinolophus monoceros from Taiwan is morphologically more similar to species in Japan than to R. pusillus. In addition to R. pusillus, another form that is morphologically similar to species in Japan was recognized from Langzhong in Sichuan Province; this may represent an undescribed species, and further examination is necessary to determine its taxonomic status. Specimens from Guang’an in Sichuan Province, China, are also different from the others, and are characterized by the smallest skull size. Although further studies are required, these specimens were tentatively identified as R. subbadius.",

            "abstractNote": "Drift, selection, or their combined effects commonly drive geographic variation in traits. Clarifying the relative roles of each process is a long-­standing research goal in evolutionary biology. Acoustic signals of bats are a phenotypic characteristic that plays an important role in social organization and species recognition. We extensively sampled the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) throughout China and Vietnam and reconstructed a species phylogeny to better understand the patterns and causes of the geographic variation of acoustic signals. Our results showed that the resting frequency (RF) of calls varied with latitude, sex, and distance among different colony locations. RF differences were not correlated with genetic distance (based on only one nuclear locus and the mitochondrial locus), climatic factors (mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitable water), or body size, although differences in calls increased with distance among various populations. This suggests that cultural drift may play more important roles than genetic drift and acoustic adaptation in shaping acoustic differences within regions in R. sinicus.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Kaeng Khoi virus (KKV), which belongs to the genus Orthobunyavirus, family Perbunyaviridae, was originally isolated from the brain tissue of bats and may cause infection in humans. In this study, the KKV strain WDBC1403 was isolated from bat ﬂies (Eucampsipoda sundaica), ectoparasites of the bat Rousettus leschenaultia, collected from Yunnan Province of China at the Sino-Burmese border.\nMethods and Results: The bat ﬂy specimens were ground and inoculated in culture cells. The WDBC1403 strain was shown to induce cytopathic effects in Vero, baby hamster kidney (BHK-21), and Tb1Lu cells, but not in C6/36 cells; however, viral gene ampliﬁcation was detected in the supernatants of C6/36 cells. Using electron microscopy, the virus was determined to be spherical, enveloped, and 80–90 nm in diameter; it was also shown to form plaques in BHK-21 cells and the titer reached 1 · 106.57 plaque-forming units/mL 24 h after infection. The phylogenetic analysis showed that WDBC1403 is a KKV strain, but is independent of the original KKV strain (PSC-19). Viral genome analysis revealed that the nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the S, M, and L segments of WDBC1403 with PSC-19 were 88.2% and 96.1%, 76.7% and 85.0%, and 78.3% and 88.9%, respectively. Two amino acids were removed at the end of the open reading frame of the M segment, and 47 nucleotides were removed in the 3¢-untranslated region of the M segment of the WDBC1403 strain compared with the PSC-19 strain.\nConclusions: The WDBC1403 strain is a highly divergent KKV strain, suggesting that there are a variety of KKV strains that exhibit molecular differences. Moreover, because of the large variations in nucleotide and amino acid sequence in the M segment, which encodes an important membrane protein, further research on antigenicity and pathogenicity in humans and animals is needed.",
