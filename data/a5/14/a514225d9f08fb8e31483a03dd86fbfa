Road networks and energy extraction infrastructure are both spatially extensive and rapidly expanding sources of noise. We predict that predators reliant on acoustic cues for hunting are particularly sensitive to louder environments. Here we examined the foraging efﬁciency of pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) when exposed to played-back trafﬁc and gas compressor station noise in the laboratory. We show that both types of noise at each of ﬁve exposure levels (58–76 dBA, 10–640 m from source) and low-level ampliﬁer noise (35 dBA) increase the time required for bats to locate prey-generated sounds by twofold to threefold. The mechanism underlying these ﬁndings is unclear and, given the potential landscape-level habitat degradation indicated by our data, we recommend continued research into the effects of noise exposure on acoustically specialized predators.",

We found a regular rhythm in three multisyllabic vocalization types (echolocation call sequences, male territorial songs and pup isolation calls) of the neotropical bat\n              Saccopteryx bilineata\n              . The intervals between element onsets were used to fit the rhythm for each individual. For echolocation call sequences, we expected rhythm frequencies around 6–24 Hz, corresponding to the wingbeat in\n              S. bilineata\n              which is strongly coupled to echolocation calls during flight. Surprisingly, we found rhythm frequencies between 6 and 24 Hz not only for echolocation sequences but also for social vocalizations, e.g. male territorial songs and pup isolation calls, which were emitted while bats were stationary. Fourier analysis of element onsets confirmed an isochronous rhythm across individuals and vocalization types. We speculate that attentional tuning to the rhythms of echolocation calls on the receivers' side might make the production of equally steady rhythmic social vocalizations beneficial.",

Ultrasonic calls with fundamental frequencies between 15–42 kHz were identified as seven categories of infant development calls and 15 categories of adult ultrasonic social calls according to the frequency and duration of the fundamental, the number of harmonics and the number of calls in a sequence. Activities were monitored remotely using infrared video cameras with simultaneous time expansion sound recorders. Distinctive polyharmonic isolation calls of newborn R. hipposideros enabled timing of births to be determined and infant echolocation marked the time when they started to fly. Trill advertisement calls in the hibernaculum indicated mating behaviour in October. Comparison of call-triggered recording times enabled variable levels of activity to be determined quickly. The longest sonogram times were in July (50.2 min/h) and in June (49.1 min/h). During these recordings, 95 and 90 adults returned to the roost after foraging and there were 16 and 42 babies, respectively. In May sound and video recordings outside a nursery roost revealed ultrasonic social calls during the emergence of 200 adult R. hipposideros when the light level was low at two lux, which showed that R. hipposideros were engaged in social activity, not light sampling. Surveys of ten nursery roosts showed that this social behaviour was typical of R. hipposideros in Wales.",

The conservation of this species is particularly challenging because it is legally hunted inside its cave roosts. Although provisional protected area status was obtained for two sites with community support, hunting continued. R. madagascariensis roosts were associated with humid forest and the loss of vegetation around caves rendered them unsuitable for the bats at two abandoned sites. A few individual hunters can have a rapid and destructive impact on R. madagascariensis roosts and future initiatives in this area should involve working with hunters to develop realistic solutions to reduce hunting.These efforts need to be supported by habitat protection measures.",

Faecal analysis revealed few seeds in the diet, suggesting that the bats either feed extensively on nectar, flowers and leaves or on fruits with seeds too large to ingest. However, bats were captured near fruiting Ficus sp. inside relatively intact forest and Ficus sp. seeds were found in the faeces during March and April. Defecated Ficus rubra seeds germinated significantly faster than seeds from ripe fruits under controlled conditions, but germination rates were similar. Radio tracking and observations of light-tagged individuals revealed that R. madagascariensis travelled a straight line distance of at least 8 km between the roost and feeding locations, with round trip foraging routes of up to 27 km. Most juveniles were trapped between March and July and we infer that weaning of young started before 8 weeks of age. The features used to distinguish juveniles from adults were no longer evident in December and it appears therefore that R. madagascariensis reaches somatic maturity within a single year. Pregnancy, lactation and weaning in this species coincide with the austral summer when food availability is higher.",

            "abstractNote": "The actual geographic distribution of the two sibling mouse‐eared bat species\n              Myotis myotis\n              and\n              Myotis blythii\n              , which occur widely sympatrically in the western Palaearctic region, remains largely controversial. This concerns particularly the specific attribution of marginal populations from the Mediterranean islands and from adjacent areas of North Africa and Asia, which are morphologically intermediate between continental\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              from Europe. This study attempts to clarify this question by using four different approaches: cranial morphology, external morphology, genetics and trophic ecology. The three latter methods show unambiguously that North Africa, Malta, Sardinia and Corsica are presently inhabited by monospecific populations of\n              M. myotis\n              . In contrast, cranial morphometrics do not yield conclusive results. These results contradict all recent studies, which attribute North African and Maltese mouse‐eared bats to\n              M. blythii\n              and consider that Sardinia and Corsica harbour sympatric populations of the two species. As concerns south‐eastem populations, doubts are also expressed about the attribution of the subspecific taxon\n              omari\n              which may actually refer to\n              M. myotis\n              instead of\n              M. blythii.\n              Protein electrophoresis is presently the only absolute method available for determining\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              throughout their distribution ranges. However, species identification may be approached by relying on less sophisticated morphometrical methods as presented in this study. Species‐specific habitat specializations are probably responsible for the differences observed between the geographic distributions of\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              , as they provide a logical groundwork for a coherent model of speciation for these two bat species.",

This study aims to broaden scientific knowledge about the presence and biodiversity of trypanosomes in Australian bats. Molecular and morphological analysis was performed on 86 blood samples collected from seven different species of microbats in Western Australia. Phylogenetic analysis on 18S rDNA and glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) sequences identified Trypanosoma dionisii in five different Australian native species of microbats; Chalinolobus gouldii, Chalinolobus morio, Nyctophilus geoffroyi, Nyctophilus major and Scotorepens balstoni. In addition, two novels, genetically distinct T. dionisii genotypes were detected and named T. dionisii genotype Aus 1 and T. dionisii genotype Aus 2. Genotype Aus 2 was the most prevalent and infected 20.9% (18/86) of bats in the present study, while genotype Aus 1 was less prevalent and was identified in 5.8% (5/86) of Australian bats. Morphological analysis was conducted on trypomastigotes identified in blood films, with morphological parameters consistent with trypanosome species in the subgenus Schizotrypanum. This is the first report of T. dionisii in Australia and in Australian native bats, which further contributes to the global distribution of this cosmopolitan bat trypanosome.",

Phylogenetic analysis distinguished seven genotypes, which could be divided into two major phylogroups having the highest bootstrap values. Phylogroup I comprises the worldwide genotype 1 (classic\n              Rabies virus\n              ), the\n              European bat lyssavirus\n              (EBL) genotypes 5 (EBL1) and 6 (EBL2), the African genotype 4 (\n              Duvenhage virus\n              ), and the\n              Australian bat lyssavirus\n              genotype 7. Phylogroup II comprises the divergent African genotypes 2 (\n              Lagos bat virus\n              ) and 3 (\n              Mokola virus\n              ). We studied immunogenic and pathogenic properties to investigate the biological significance of this phylogenetic grouping. Viruses from phylogroup I (\n              Rabies virus\n              and EBL1) were found to be pathogenic for mice when injected by the intracerebral or the intramuscular route, whereas viruses from phylogroup II (Mokola and Lagos bat viruses) were only pathogenic by the intracerebral route. We showed that the glycoprotein R333 residue essential for virulence was naturally replaced by a D333 in the phylogroup II viruses, likely resulting in their attenuated pathogenicity. Moreover, cross-neutralization distinguished the same phylogroups. Within each phylogroup, the amino acid sequence of the glycoprotein ectodomain was at least 74% identical, and antiglycoprotein virus-neutralizing antibodies displayed cross-neutralization. Between phylogroups, the identity was less than 64.5% and the cross-neutralization was absent, explaining why the classical rabies vaccines (phylogroup I) cannot protect against lyssaviruses from phylogroup II. Our tree-axial analysis divided lyssaviruses into two phylogroups that more closely reflect their biological characteristics than previous serotypes and genotypes.",

            "abstractNote": "In active sensing, animals make motor adjustments to match sensory inputs to specialized neural circuitry. Here, we describe an active sensing system for sound level processing. The pallid bat uses downward frequencymodulated (FM) sweeps as echolocation calls for general orientation and obstacle avoidance. The bat’s auditory cortex contains a region selective for these FM sweeps (FM sweep-selective region, FMSR). We show that the vast majority of FMSR neurons are sensitive and strongly selective for relatively low levels (30-60 dB SPL). Behavioral testing shows that when a flying bat approaches a target, it reduces output call levels to keep echo levels between ϳ30 and 55 dB SPL. Thus, the pallid bat behaviorally matches echo levels to an optimized neural representation of sound levels. FMSR neurons are more selective for sound levels of FM sweeps than tones, suggesting that across-frequency integration enhances level tuning. Level-dependent timing of high-frequency sideband inhibition in the receptive field shapes increased level selectivity for FM sweeps. Together with previous studies, these data indicate that the same receptive field properties shape multiple filters (sweep direction, rate, and level) for FM sweeps, a sound common in multiple vocalizations, including human speech. The matched behavioral and neural adaptations for low-intensity echolocation in the pallid bat will facilitate foraging with reduced probability of acoustic detection by prey.",

Both species roosted within the internodes of one species of bamboo, but were only once found together at roost. Roosting groups, which formed before entry in the morning, were not limited in size by the dimensions of the roost site. In both species the sexes exhibited different roosting behaviour, the males tending to be solitary and the females gregarious. Seasonal variations in associations occurred correlated with the reproductive cycle. Banding demonstrated that the populations were highly mobile, that the bats frequently changed roost sites, and that the roosting associations were of an ephemeral nature.",

Blood parasites of the Order Haemosporidia, responsible for malaria, have become the focus of a broad range of studies in evolutionary biology. Interestingly, molecular-based studies on avian malaria have revealed much higher species diversity than previously inferred with morphology. Meanwhile, studies on bat haemosporidian have been largely neglected. In Europe, only one genus (Polychromophilus) and two species have been morphologically described. To evaluate the presence of potential cryptic species and parasite prevalence, we undertook a molecular characterization of Polychromophilus in temperate zone bats. We used a nested-PCR approach on the cytochrome b mitochondrial gene to detect the presence of parasites in 237 bats belonging to four different species and in the dipteran bat fly Nycteribia kolenatii, previously described as being the vector of Polychromophilus. Polychromophilus murinus was found in the four bat species and in the insect vector with prevalence ranging from 4% for Myotis myotis to 51% for M. daubentoni. By sequencing 682 bp, we then investigated the phylogenetic relationships of Polychromophilus to other published malarial lineages. Seven haplotypes were found, all very closely related, suggesting the presence of a single species in our samples. These haplotypes formed a well-defined clade together with Haemosporidia of tropical bats, revealing a worldwide distribution of this parasite mostly neglected by malarial studies since the 1980s.",

We examined variation patterns in the resting frequency (RF) of echolocation calls emitted by the intermediate leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros larvatus, on a broad geographical scale. Data mining technology and Kruskal–Wallis test both showed substantial variation with a longitudinal pattern in RF in H. larvatus among colonies, and this variation was associated with geographical distance and not body size. In addition, we found that a high degree of variability between individuals was hidden under the geographical variation. The results support an effect of random cultural drift, and challenge the prey detection hypothesis. Moreover, an acoustic difference among local island colonies may be indicative of a vocal dialect. We found that each colony of H. larvatus seems to maintain a ‘private bandwidth’, which could be used for colony identity and individual communication thus helping individuals and colonies to get a number of ﬁtness beneﬁts.",

The genome is found to be 17,470 bp in length and has a base composition of A (33.1%), G (13.6%), C (24.6%), and T (28.6%). Similar to other bats, it contains a typically conserved structure including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 1 control region (D-loop). Most of the genes are encoded on H-strand, except for the eight tRNA and ND6 genes. All protein-coding genes start with an ATG codon except for ND2, ND3 and ND5, which initiate with ATC or ATA instead, and terminate with the typical stop codon (TAA/TAG) or a single T (T– –) or an unexpected codon of AGA. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence provided here would be useful for further phylogenetic analysis and population genetic studies in M. brandtii.",

Significant differences in RF were observed among populations throughout the species range in Mainland China, and this variation was positively and significantly related to climate conditions, especially environmental humidity, but the variability was only weakly associated with geographical distance. Sex dimorphism in the RF of R. pusillus may imply that female and male might keep their frequencies within a narrow range for sex recognition. Moreover, bats adjusted resting frequency to humidity, which may imply partitioning diet by prey size or the influence of rainfall noise. The results indicate that bats adjust echolocation call frequency to adapt to environmental conditions.

Here, we evaluated the possible causes of geographical size variation patterns in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), a bat species widely distributed across the Palearctic.",

Bartonella and hemotropic mycoplasmas are bacteria that parasite different mammals’ species, including humans, causing different clinical manifestations. The present work aimed investigating the occurrence and assessing the phylogenetic positioning of Bartonella spp. and Mycoplasma spp. in neotropical bats sampled from Brazil. Between December 2015 and April 2016, 325 blood and/or tissues samples were collected from 162 bats comprising 19 different species sampled in ﬁve states of Brazil. Out of 322 bat samples collected, while 17 (5·28%) were positive to quantitative PCR for Bartonella spp. based on nuoG gene, 45 samples (13·97%) were positive to cPCR assays for hemoplasmas based on 16S rRNA gene. While seven sequences were obtained for Bartonella (nuoG) (n = 3), gltA (n = 2), rpoB (n = 1), ftsZ (n = 1), ﬁve 16S rRNA sequences were obtained for hemoplasmas. In the phylogenetic analysis, the Bartonella sequences clustered with Bartonella genotypes detected in bats sampled in Latin America countries. All ﬁve hemoplasmas sequences clustered together as a monophyletic group by Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses. The present work showed the ﬁrst evidence of circulation of Bartonella spp. and hemoplasmas among bats in Brazil.",

The gross distribution of the lingual papillae was observed to be the same in both sexes; values obtained for the weight and length of the tongue were higher in the females, although no statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed (P > 0.05). The number of ridges on the hard palate displayed sexual dimorphism.

This study examined if the columnar cactus\n              Stenocereus queretaroensis\n              , a tropical species endemic to western Mexico, is bat‐pollinated, by studying its pollination biology and the foraging behavior of potential pollinators. Flowers were produced in winter through spring, peaking in April. Anthesis was nocturnal, and stigma and anther turgidity began around 2200 hours. Production of nectar secretion and highest sugar concentration and energy supply were nocturnal, peaking between 2200 and 2400 hours. Manual auto‐pollination and exclusion experiments showed that self‐pollination yielded no fruits, while nocturnal pollinators resulted in high fruit set and seed set compared to diurnal pollination treatments. The nectar‐feeding bat\n              Leptonycteris curasoae\n              (Phyllostomidae) was the main nocturnal pollinator with the highest effective pollination. Peak bat visitation coincided with peaks in nectar production. The high abundance of\n              L. curasoae\n              throughout the 4‐yr study, suggests that it is a seasonally reliable pollinator for this columnar cactus. While pollination syndromes have been increasingly called into question in recent years, this study suggests that at least for this system, there is a fairly close fit between pollinator and pollination syndrome.",

Free association and flight were permitted, and mother‐infant pairs were identified and marked on the day of birth (day 0). Suckling associations were identified daily (n = 195) and females were never found suckling young other than their own. A series of choice experiments using young aged 0–10 days and 15–25 days indicated that females would permit only their own offspring to suckle during both early and late lactation. During early lactation, mothers actively selected their young and encouraged suckling but did not do so during late lactation. Mothers were most often indifferent to approaches by alien young but occasionally aggressively rejected them. Mothers never aggressively rejected their own young but frequently were indifferent to them. Young attempted to suckle from any mother without discrimination.",

The taxonomic status of the taxon in the Sundaic subregion remains uncertain however as the limited studies to date have been largely based on morphology. The aim of the present study was to determine the taxonomic status of subspecific forms recognized in the subregion and to evaluate phylogeographic distinctiveness between those occurring in Borneo and the Malay Peninsula using genetic, morphological and acoustic datasets. Two forms were confirmed: R. a. nesites from Borneo and R. a. superans from the peninsula. The previous recognition of a population from southernmost Sumatra as R. a. superans was not supported, however, as this form is likely R. a. affinis. Genetic divergence between these three forms is rather deep and is estimated to have occurred during the arid climatic period of the Pleistocene when suitable habitats were reduced to isolated pockets. Our results support the phylogeographic distinctiveness hypothesis as R. affinis sensu lato shows discrete affinities between Borneo and the Malay Peninsula. Discovery of new forms of R. affinis is likely with greater sampling effort throughout the region. Our study also demonstrates the importance of employing multiple datasets in taxonomic evaluations, as the use of morphological and/or acoustic datasets alone could lead to erroneous conclusions.",

The two species were sympatric only at Batang Duri, a village near rainforest.\n              \n              \n                The climate of the study area is characterized by uniformly high temperatures and rainfall, but relatively there are two seasons of more rain and two of less rain. Reproduction of both species is seasonal with continuous bimodal polyoestry. Within each species, the females are in reproductive synchrony, with young born in two distinct seasons (3–4 months each) of parturition 5–7 months apart. Each parturition is followed by postpartum oestrus. For each species, gestation spans about 5–6 or 5–7 months, with embryonic development delayed in the early stages. Births of neither species were timed to the seasons of greater rainfall or to the general season of flowering/fruiting of trees. Instead, births were centred about the two seasons of less rainfall and probably timed to the fruiting of certain species of trees, including mangoes for\n                C. brachyotis.\n              \n              \n                The weight data for\n                C. brachyotis\n                indicated a difference in diet between adult males and females. The bimodal pattern of weight increase/decrease for adult males corresponded to the bimodal cycle of ripened mangoes in Brunei. Although weight increase/decrease for adult females did not correspond to the bimodal cycle of ripened mangoes, none the less the two birthing seasons did, following shortly after or beginning at the two times of abundant ripened mangoes. Similarly, adult males and females of\n                C. minutus\n                appeared to have different diets and/or different foraging patterns.\n              \n              \n                Both sexes of\n                C. minutus\n                (and probably also of\n                C. brachyotis)\n                attain maturity at about 7 months, with females giving birth for the first time at about 12 months. Females conceive shortly upon attaining sexual maturity and are thereafter in states of essentially continuous reproduction with two young born annually (2 litters/yr, 1 neonate/birth). Relative to other fruit bats (Mickleburgh, Hutson & Racey, 1992),\n                C. minutus\n                and\n                C. brachyotis\n                have high rates of reproduction.\n              \n            \n            \n              Summary\n              \n                In summary, the reproductive cycles of\n                C. minutas\n                and\n                C. brachyotis\n                are shown in Fig. 12. Reproduction of both species is seasonal and continuous bimodal polyoestry, however, reproduction of neither species is linked to rains nor the general season of flowering/fruiting of trees.\n              \n              \n                Adult females of both species produce 2 litters/yr, 1 neonate/birth. Within each species, the females are in reproductive synchrony, with young born in two distinct seasons (3–4 months each) of parturition 5–7 months apart, centring about the two seasons of less rain, which may correspond to the fruiting of certain species of trees (e.g. mangoes for\n                C. brachyotis\n                ). Each parturition is followed by postpartum oestrus. Gestation spans about 5–6 months, with embryonic development delayed or arrested in early stages. Both sexes of\n                C. minutas\n                (and probably also\n                C. brachyotis\n                ) attain sexual maturity at about 7 months, with females giving birth the first time at about 12 months.",

Reproduction of the long-tongued nectar bat Macroglossus minimus (Pteropodidae) in Brunei, Borneo. — Acta Zoologica (Stockholm) 89: 53– 58 The long-tongued nectar bat Macroglossus minimus lagochilus (Megachiroptera, Pteropodidae) is a small fruit bat inhabiting South-east Asia. Its reproduction was studied in Brunei, Borneo, where individuals were usually captured in rainforest (Ulu Temburong). Adult females (n = 23) had body masses of 13.0–19.0 g, with forelimbs 3.83–4.33 cm in length. All adult females were pregnant, with pregnancies observed during every month except May, September and November when no adult females were captured. Female M. minimus in Brunei have a reproductive cycle that is consistent with a pattern of seasonal bimodal polyoestry. Most births appear to occur from November to May, during which time females experience two births: the ﬁrst centred around November and December, and the second centred around April and May. These two birth seasons appear correlated to the two seasons of greater rainfall in Brunei: October to December, and April to July. Oestrous and mating apparently occur soon after each birth; however, there appears to be a 2- to 3-month period of delayed embryonic development following the births centred around April and May.The data are consistent with embryonic development commencing around July and August (after a delay) for the births centred around November and December, and around December and January for the births centred around April and May. The data suggest that all adult females participate in each breeding season. Adult males (n = 20) had body masses of 12.5–18.0 g, with forelimbs 3.91–4.26 cm in length.",

Because these fleas are not known to occur on bats, we hypothesized that the fleasʼ feeding performance (i.e. feeding and digestion rates) would be higher when feeding on their natural host than on either of the bats that they do not naturally parasitize. We found that mass-specific blood-meal size of both male and female fleas was significantly lower when feeding on Kuhlʼs pipistrelles than on the other two species, but was not different in female fleas feeding on fruit bats or on jirds at all stages of digestion. However, more male fleas achieved higher levels of engorgement if they fed on Sundevallʼs jirds than if they fed on Egyptian fruit bats. The fleas digested blood of fruit bats and jirds significantly faster than blood of Kuhlʼs pipistrelle. In addition, after a single blood meal, the survival time of fleas fed on normothermic Kuhlʼs pipistrelles was significantly shorter than that of fleas fed on Sundevallʼs jirds and even lower when male fleas fed on Egyptian fruit bats. Thus, our prediction was partially supported: normothermic Kuhlʼs pipistrelles were inferior hosts for fleas compared with Sandevallʼs jirds and Egyptian fruit bats. Interestingly, the proportion of engorged fleas that fed on torpid Kuhlʼs pipistrelles was significantly higher than the proportion of the fleas that fed on normothermic individuals, indicating that becoming torpid might be a liability, rather than an effective defense against parasites.",

The mitogenome shows conserved gene content and order similar with other mammalian mitogenomes, being composed of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and one control region. The majority of genes are encoded on the H-Strand except for ND6 and 8 tRNAs as found in other bat species. The field identification of Myotis bechsteinii was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using datasets comprising whole mitogenomes and COXI. This mitogenome is a resource for future studies of Myotis bats and other mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "Leptospirosis is the most common bacterial zoonosis globally. The pathogen, Leptospira spp., is primarily associated with rodent reservoirs. However, a wide range of other species has been implicated as reservoirs or dead-end hosts. We conducted a survey for Leptospira spp. in bats and rodents from Papua New Guinea. Kidney samples were collected from 97 pteropodid bats (five species), 37 insectivorous bats from four different families (six species) and 188 rodents (two species). Leptospires were detected in a high proportion of pteropodid bats, including Nyctimene cf. albiventer (35%), Macroglossus minimus (34%) and Rousettus amplexicaudatus (36%). Partial sequencing of the secY gene from rodent and bat leptospires showed host species clustering, with Leptospira interrogans and L. weilii detected in rodents and L. kirschneri and a potential novel species of Leptospira detected in bats. Further research is needed in Papua New Guinea and other locales in the Pacific region to gain a better understanding of the circulation dynamics of leptospires in reservoir species and the risks to public and veterinary health.",

            "abstractNote": "As in other mammals, ontogenesis of the terminal nerve (TN) in the mouse-eared bat (Myotis myotis) starts shortly after the formation of the olfactory placode, a derivative of the ectoderm. During development of the olfactory pit, proliferating neuroblasts thicken the placodal epithelium and one cell population migrates toward the rostroventral tip of the telencephalon. Here they accumulate in a primordial terminal ganglion, which successively divides into smaller units. Initial ﬁbers of the TN can be distinguished from olfactory ﬁbers in the mid-embryonic period. The main TN ﬁber bundle (mfb) originates from the anteriormost ganglion in the nasal roof, whereas one or more inconstant smaller ﬁber bundles (sfb) originate from one or more smaller ganglia in the basal part of the rostral nasal septum. The ﬁbers of the mfb and sfbs join in the posterior quarter of the nasal roof before reaching the central ganglion (M) located in the meninges medial to the olfactory bulb. From the mid-fetal period onward, a thin TN ﬁber bundle with some intermingled perikarya connects M to the brain by penetrating its wall rostral to the olfactory tubercle. Additional smaller ganglia may occur in this region. The TN and its ganglia persist in postnatal and adult bats but the number of perikarya is reduced here. Moreover, the different potential functions of the TN are discussed brieﬂy. Anat Rec Part A, 288A:1201–1215, 2006. Ó 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Hair samples were taken from individuals from Lithuania, Northern Poland and The Netherlands. PCR amplifications of mtDNA control region and subsequent restriction analysis provided data that were computed using Arlequin and Treecon softwares for AMOVA analysis and UPGMA clustering.. Fourteen mtDNA haplotypes (lineages) have been found that were grouped into four main clusters. Interestingly individuals from Rotterdam and Darzlubska forest clustered together, while individuals from Lithuania and Sobieszewo Island were grouped in another cluster, nearby clusters including the other Polish samples (Vistula Split and Wdzydze Landscape Park). According to these preliminary results Poland could be the meeting place of western and eastern populations.",

This is the first study to assess variation in size and shape from strictly geometric terms. Both factors are assessed by statistical perspectives of distribution, overlap and relative distances. Despite its overlap, the size of the skull seems to be the most influential character for the discrimination of species, with shape playing a much smaller role. The smallest species seems to be the most distinct in shape, not only in terms of distance among centroids in morphometric space, but also in the overall trend and direction of variation. Contrary to previous studies, sexual dimorphism is not given by size but by distinct shapes of the skull. Characters such as the shape of the maxilla, previously described qualitatively as discrete with sharp boundaries, appear to be truly continuous with fuzzy borders among species. Because morphometric space is a gamut of continuous variation and overlap, the taxonomic error rate for size characters seems to be substantial for the medium-sized species (Carollia brevicauda Schinz, 1821), with approximately 30–40% of individuals erroneously assigned to a different species after a jackknifed discriminant function. This taxonomic error is higher for shape characters. Morphological, systematic and ecological consequences of the observed patterns of shape and size variation are commented within the context of previously proposed arguments and hypotheses.",

This trophic strategy has been documented in two families of bats, Pteropodidae (Old World fruit bats) and Phyllostomidae (New World leaf-nosed bats). Existing folivory hypotheses for bats suggest this behavior provides a dietary supplement of protein and other essential minerals due to a deficiency of these in a frugivorous diet. The Caatinga is a seasonally deciduous tropical dry forest where most of the vegetation is leafless and dormant during the extended dry season. Here we present the first evidence of folivory in bats from the Brazilian Caatinga, with evidence for the phyllostomid Artibeus planirostris ingesting the leaves of at least 16 species of plants. We include a bibliographic review of bat folivory in the tropics. Additionally, we propose a new hypothesis on folivory in bats for this semiarid environment.",

Xeronycteris vieirai apparently has a distribution restricted to the semi-arid Brazilian Caatinga, a habitat that has been highly degraded. We present here the first information about the natural history of X. vieirai, obtained through a large research project aiming at the ecology and conservation of bats in the Caatinga of the states of Rio Grande do Norte and Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. From June 2014 to October 2015 we captured 62 individuals of X. vieirai at five sites, which represent new records and expand its known distribution, establishing the northernmost record. Xeronycteris vieirai feeds on nectar of at least nine species of plants belonging to six families, and mainly on the columnar cactus Pilosocereus pachycladus. The species has peak activity at 1830 h and shows an apparently seasonally monoestrous reproductive cycle (June–December). Adult females have longer forearms than adult males and are significantly heavier; there is no bias in the sex ratio. A colony of approximately 20 individuals was observed in a well-ventilated cave with natural lighting, representing the first documented roost for the species. Finally, ectoparasites of the genus Trichobius were found on 85.7% of the individuals examined, with no difference in parasite load between males and females.",

            "abstractNote": "Echolocation allows bats to occupy diverse nocturnal niches. Bats almost always use echolocation, even when other sensory stimuli are available to guide navigation. Here, using arrays of calibrated infrared cameras and ultrasonic microphones, we demonstrate that hoary bats (\n              Lasiurus cinereus\n              ) use previously unknown echolocation behaviours that challenge our current understanding of echolocation. We describe a novel call type (‘micro’ calls) that has three orders of magnitude less sound energy than other bat calls used in open habitats. We also document bats flying close to microphones (less than 3 m) without producing detectable echolocation calls. Acoustic modelling indicates that bats are not producing calls that exceed 70–75 dB at 0.1 m, a level that would have little or no known use for a bat flying in the open at speeds exceeding 7 m s\n              −1\n              . This indicates that hoary bats sometimes fly without echolocation. We speculate that bats reduce echolocation output to avoid eavesdropping by conspecifics during the mating season. These findings might partly explain why tens of thousands of hoary bats are killed by wind turbines each year. They also challenge the long-standing assumption that bats—model organisms for sensory specialization—are reliant on sonar for nocturnal navigation.",

            "abstractNote": "Sixty-two years since last observed alive, Mormotomyia hirsuta Austen, the “terrible hairy fly”, was found inside and outside a large, cave-like cleft boulder at the summit of Ukasi Hill in eastern Kenya, the type locality of the species. Adults were observed climbing the walls of the boulder and walking on thick layers of bat guano, in which larvae and puparia were also discovered. Large numbers of M. hirsuta were observed on and at the base of the northern side of the boulder, which at the time of capture experienced continuous shade during daylight hours. Only three individuals were observed at the southern opening, ex­posed to direct sunlight and hot, dry conditions. A collection of vertebrate bones and skulls from layers of guano both inside and outside the cleft revealed several vertebrate associates, including two species of Chiroptera, Chaerephon cf. bivittatus (Heuglin) and Tadarida aegyptiaca (E. Geoffroy), which are probably the two major guano-producing species responsible for the larval breeding medium. Male-biased sexual size dimorphism was pronounced in adult M. hirsuta, with seven body-part measurements, including legs, larger by 33–61 % in males than females. Males demonstrated isometric growth while female growth was allometric. In contrast to males, female head and thorax lengths did not increase proportionally with leg length. Estimates of genetic diversity in the Ukasi population show higher than expected allelic diversity and indicate possible gene flow and frequent population bottlenecks. To promote the conservation of this endangered species, a joint effort has been initiated between the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology, Nairobi and the National Museums of Kenya, Nairobi, to gazette the Ukasi hill area as a pro­tected site.",

            "abstractNote": "Prescribed fire is becoming a common management tool for restoring forests of North America; however, effects of prescribed fire on forest-dwelling bats remain unclear. During 2006 and 2007, we monitored prey availability, diet, foraging behavior, and roost selection of adult female northern bats (Myotis septentrionalis) before and after 2 prescribed fires in dissected terrain of the Red River Gorge on the Daniel Boone National Forest in eastern Kentucky. Size of home ranges and core areas did not vary between bats radiotracked before and after fires. Bats foraged more often in the vicinity of pine stands than hardwood or mixed stands, and along ridges and midslopes than lower slopes, regardless of burn condition. Home ranges were closer to burned habitats following fires than to unburned habitats. Abundance of coleopterans, dipterans, and all insects combined captured in blacklight traps increased following prescribed fires. Fecal samples of bats demonstrated lepidopterans, coleopterans, and dipterans to be the 3 most important groups of insect prey, with consumption of dipterans increasing after burning. Bats chose roosts that were taller in height and in earlier stages of decay than random snags, and after prescribed fires chose roosts in trees with a greater number of cavities and a higher percentage of bark coverage. More roosts were observed in burned habitats (74.3%; n 5 26) after fires than in unburned habitats (25.7%; n 5 9). The results of this work suggest that northern bats are tolerant to prescribed fire on the landscape pattern and scale observed in this study. Northern bats responded to habitat alterations resulting from prescribed fires through shifts in the location of foraging areas as bats tracked changes in insect availability, and through shifts in the selection of roost trees by occupying trees and snags possessing more potential roosting microsites.",

We measured temperatures beneath plates of exfoliating bark of six species of dead trees used for roosting by long-legged myotis (Myotis volans) from June to July 2003−2006 in Idaho and Oregon, USA, and compared these across tree species and with ambient temperature (TA). Temperature profiles beneath bark oscillated within the range of TA, demonstrating the ability of bark cavities on dead trees to insulate against daily extremes in maximum and minimum TA. Slope position affected the difference in bark cavity temperature from TA during daytime periods, with bark cavities on dead trees in upper slope positions being cooler than TA compared to bark cavities on dead trees in lower slope positions. Differences in bark cavity temperatures from TA varied among dead tree species during nighttime periods, with white fir (Abies concolor) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) warmer than TA compared to other dead tree species. Mean daily maximum temperatures beneath bark of dead white fir, grand fir (Abies grandis), western white pine (Pinus monticola), and ponderosa pine met or exceeded the theoretical lower critical temperature (TLC) of long-legged myotis (range = 29.7–30.5ºC) within several hours of sunset, but were substantially colder for much of the day. These data indicate long-legged myotis roosting beneath bark of dead conifer trees likely experience temperatures conducive to use of torpor during early morning hours, with potential for passive re-warming in late afternoon facilitated by increases in daily temperatures beneath bark prior to evening emergence.",

Although the effect of self fertilization on seed ﬁtness in hermaphrodites has been considered theoretically, this effect is far from intuitive, because it can either increase the relative seed ﬁtness of the females (if it leads hermaphrodites to produce inbred, low quality offspring) or decrease it (if it provides reproductive assurance to hermaphrodites). Hence, empirical investigation is needed to document whether relative seed ﬁtness varies with whether pollen is or is not limiting to seed production. In the current study, we measured fruit set and seed production in both females and hermaphrodites and the selﬁng rate in hermaphrodites in two experimental patches that differed in sex ratios in the gynodioecious plant Silene nutans. We found an impact of plant gender, patch, and their interaction, with females suffering from stronger pollen limitation when locally frequent. In the most pollen-limited situation, the selﬁng rate of hermaphrodites increased and provided hermaphrodites with a type of reproductive assurance that is not available to females. By integrating both the beneﬁcial (reproductive assurance) and costly effects (through inbreeding depression) of self-pollination, we showed that whether females did or did not exhibit higher seed ﬁtness depended on the degree of pollen limitation on seed production.",

Its distribution covers whole Eurasia, and the species is thus well adapted to different habitat types. However, recent population declines have been reported and rapid conservation efforts are needed. Here we present a high-quality de novo genome assembly of a female northern bat from Finland (BLF_Eptnil_asm_v1.0). The assembly was generated using a combination of Pacbio and Omni-C technologies. The primary assembly comprises 726 scaffolds spanning 2.0 Gb, represented by a scaffold N50 of 102 Mb, a contig N50 of 66.2 Mb, and a BUSCO completeness score of 93.73%. Annotation of the assembly identified 20,250 genes. This genome will be an important resource for the conservation and evolutionary genomic studies especially in understanding how rapid environmental changes affect northern species.",

It is related to P. anomaluri and the hosts of both species share the same habitat : hollow trees of the tropical forest.

            "abstractNote": "Bats have long been observed to be the hosts and the origin of numerous human diseases. Bats, like all mammals, rely on a number of innate immune mechanisms to combat invading pathogens, including the interferon type I, II and III responses. Ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) is a key modulator of these interferon responses. Within these pathways, ISG15 can serve to stabilize host proteins modulating innate immune responses and act as a cytokine. Post-translational modifications of viral proteins introduced by ISG15 have also been observed to directly affect the function of numerous viral proteins. Unlike ubiquitin, which is virtually identical across all animals, comparison of ISG15s across species reveals that they are relatively divergent, with sequence identity dropping to as low as ∼58% among mammals. In addition to serving as an obstacle to the zoonotic transmission of influenza, these ISG15 species–species differences have also long been shown to have an impact on the function of viral deISGylases. Recently, the structure of the first nonhuman ISG15, originating from mouse, suggested that the structures of human ISG15 may not be reflective of other species. Here, the structure of ISG15 from the bat species\n              Myotis davidii\n              solved to 1.37 Å resolution is reported. Comparison of this ISG15 structure with those from human and mouse not only underscores the structural impact of ISG15 species–species differences, but also highlights a conserved hydrophobic motif formed between the two domains of ISG15. Using the papain-like deISGylase from Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus as a probe, the biochemical importance of this motif in ISG15–protein engagements was illuminated.",

Although recent studies have examined the phylogenetics and systematics of this genus, relatively few have assessed the population genetics of species distributed on oceanic islands and no study has focused on the demographics of P. niger. Here, we present mitochondrial DNA sequence data from 39 individuals of P. niger collected from four main colonies distributed throughout Mauritius. Our results indicate that the Mauritian population of P. niger is likely panmictic, with moderate to high levels of gene flow occurring among colonies distributed across the island. Collectively, our sequence data suggest moderate levels of genetic variation within the population. These findings will help to inform ongoing conservation and disease surveillance initiatives.",

Hipposideros bicolor (131 kHz) is designated as H. bicolor; H. bicolor (142 kHz) is provisionally designated as H. atrox. The morphometric characters, acoustic data, and geographical distribution of H. pomona are also reviewed. The diagnostic characters of these frequently confused taxa are discussed, with a detailed study of the external, cranio-dental, and bacular morphology, and acoustic features. New data on the conservation status, distribution and ecology of these three species are included.",

Therefore, the primary aim of this prospective, exploratory study was to examine whether a systematic cardiac ultrasound protocol is feasible in this critically endangered species and to report basic measures of cardiac structure and function from a cohort of apparently healthy bats. A secondary aim was to test the effect posture (dorsal recumbency vs. roosting) has upon cardiac function in this species. Transthoracic echocardiograms, including 2D, Doppler, and tissue Doppler measures of cardiac structure and function were completed as part of routine health examinations for bats at a single center (n = 19). Bats were then grouped by age and disease status and the mean and range data reported for each group. In healthy adult bats, with the exception of a reduction in heart rate (P ≤ 0.05), right atrial systolic area (P ≤ 0.05), and right ventricular velocity during atrial contraction, there were no signiﬁcant changes in cardiac structure or function in response to the roosting position. However, in the bats presenting with dilated cardiomyopathy the current data suggest that left ventricular ejection fraction is improved while roosting. Further work is required to conﬁrm our initial ﬁndings, generate diagnostic reference intervals, and explore the causes of dilated cardiomyopathy in this species.",

This is a common situation for most of the Central-European bat species. In South Tyrol, however, large maternity colonies of mouse eared bats are often situated amidst zones of intensive apple growing and they usually thrive. A radiotracking study conducted in July 2000 and 2001 shows strong foraging activity in the valley bottom and nearby slopes. The elongation of the home range was 15 km, core areas ranged from 2 to 6 km away from the nursery. The greater mouse eared bats mainly used intensively cultivated orchards and deciduous shrub forests. Mature forests, meadows and pastures were scarcely used. Unfortunately intensification in apple growing; eliminating high trees and covering orchards with hail nets, is an ongoing process. To preserve greater mouse eared bats it is necessary for them to continue using the orchards in the future. So it seems necessary to convince farmers that bats in the orchards are beneficial.",

            "abstractNote": "Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasitic protozoan that infects a diversity of hosts constituting the cycle of enzootic transmission in wild environments and causing disease in humans (Chagas disease) and domestic animals. Wild mammals constitute natural reservoirs of this parasite, which is transmitted by hematophagous kissing bugs of the family Reduviidae. T. cruzi is genetically subdivided into six discrete typing units (DTUs), T. cruzi (Tc)I to TcVI. In Brazil, especially in the state of Parana´, TcI and TcII are widely distributed. However, TcII is less frequently found in wild reservoirs and triatomine, and more frequently found in patients. The goal of this study was to investigate the natural occurrence of T. cruzi in wild synanthropic mammals captured in urban forest fragments of the Atlantic Forest of Parana´, southern Brazil. In this way, 12 opossums and 35 bats belonging to ﬁve species were captured in urban forest parks of the city of Maringa´, Parana´, an area considered endemic for Chagas disease. PCR-kinetoplast DNA molecular diagnostic reveals Trypanosoma sp. infection in 12 (100%) Didelphis albiventris and 10 (40%) Artibeus lituratus. In addition to demonstrating the presence of Trypanosoma in the two groups of mammals studied, we obtained an isolate of the parasite genotyped as TcII by ampliﬁcation of the cytochrome oxidase II gene by PCR, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism with AluI, and conﬁrmed by PCR of rDNA 24Sa. This is the ﬁrst record of the encounter in wild mammals of Trypanosoma DNA (in A. lituratus) and T. cruzi DTU TcII (in D. albiventris) in the state of Parana´.",

In order to face the taxonomic urgency that results from this taxonomic gap combined with the biodiversity crisis, zootaxonomy needs efficient, rigorous and automatic nomenclatural Rules, that allow to spend a minimal time on nomenclatural problems—rather than investing time, energy and money in renaming millions of already named taxa in order to follow alternative nomenclatural systems, e.g., “phylogenetic” ones, that furthermore do not show theoretical superiority to the current Linnaean-Stricklandian one. The current Code, result of a 250-year improvement process, is based on very sound and healthy Rules, being theory-free regarding taxonomy, relying on objective allocation of nomina to taxa by a system of ostension using onomatophores, and on an objective basic Principle, priority, for recognizing the valid nomen of a taxon in case of synonymy or homonymy. Nevertheless, this nomenclatural system is certainly not perfect. It should be modified at least in nine directions: (1) it should adopt a technical terminology avoiding possible misinterpretations from outsiders of the field and even from specialists, and allowing a precise formalisation of its mode of functioning; (2) its plan should be drastically modified; (3) its Principles should be redefined, and some added; (4) material evidence for the allocation of nomina to taxa through specimens deposited in permanent collections should be given more weight; (5) it should incorporate all nomina of higher taxa, providing clear and strict universal Rules for their naming, whereas conserving the traditional nomina largely used in non-specialized systematic literature; (6) it should allow for the recognition of many more ranks at lower nomenclatural levels, i.e., just above genus, between genus and species, and below species; (7) it should provide much more stringent Rules for the protection against priority of “wellknown” nomina or sozonyms; (8) various “details” should be addressed, various Rules and Recommendations changed before a new edition of the Code is published; (9) the procedure of implementations of changes in the Code should be modified in order to involve zootaxonomists of the whole world in the decisions. In several instances, the Rules of the Code should become much more compulsory for all zoologists, editors and publishers, to avoid the publication of endless and sometimes most detrimental discussions among taxonomists which give a poor image of nomenclature and taxonomy among the biological sciences, such as bitter discussions about the “best” nomen to be used under a so-called “usage” philosophy, or about nomina to be applied to higher taxa. Code-compliance in zootaxonomic publications should be highlighted, and editors and publishers should require from authors who follow alternative nomenclatural Rules (or no rule at all) to make it clear by using particular modes of writing their nomina. It is argued here that if the Code of the 21st century does not evolve to incorporate these changes, it will prove unable to play its role in front of several important recent theoretical and practical developments of taxonomy and run the risk of being abandoned by a part of the international community of zootaxonomists. The latter could then adopt alternative “phylogenetic” nomenclatural Rules, despite the severe practical problems and theoretical flaws posed by such projects. This would be most detrimental for all comparative biological disciplines including systematics, and even for the unity of biology. In the course of this discussion, a few recommendations are given concerning the standards and guidelines suggested by recent authors for a good, modern, integrative taxonomy.",

Pollination is by bees or bats, raising the question of the evolutionary direction and frequency of pollinator shifts. Studies that investigated such shifts in other clades have suggested that bat pollination might be an evolutionary end point.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Methods:\n              Plastid and nuclear DNA sequences were obtained for 50 accessions representing 30 species of\n              Cayaponia\n              and close relatives, and analyses were carried out to test monophyly, infer divergence times, and reconstruct ancestral states for habitat preferences and pollination modes.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Key results:\n              The phylogeny shows that\n              Cayaponia\n              is monophyletic as long as\n              Selysia\n              (a genus with four species from Central and South America) is included. The required nomenclatural transfers are made in this paper. African and Madagascan accessions of\n              C. africana\n              form a clade that is part of a polytomy with Caribbean and South American species, and the inferred divergence time of 2–5 Ma implies a transoceanic dispersal event from the New World to Africa. The ancestral state reconstructions suggest that\n              Cayaponia\n              originated in tropical forests from where open savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to savanna habitats.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Conclusions: Cayaponia\n              provides the first example of evolutionary transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa.",

            "abstractNote": "Variations in environmental conditions along gradients play an important role in species distribution through environmental filtering of morphological and physiological traits; however, their effects on bat diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of the distance to the nearest watercourse, terrain elevation, vegetation clutter, basal area and canopy height on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and on the predominance of some functional traits (body mass, wing morphology and trophic level) of bat assemblages (phyllostomid and mormoopid bats) in a terra firme forest, in the northeastern Brazilian Amazon. We captured bats using mist nets in 15 permanent plots over a 25 km2 area of continuous forest. We captured 279 individuals belonging to 28 species with a total of 77.760 m2.h of sampling effort. Our results showed that bat richness increases as a function of distance to the nearest watercourse and that the assemblage also changes, with more diverse taxonomic and functional groups in areas further from the watercourse. Furthermore, elevation positively affects species richness, and the basal area of the forest positively influences the average body mass of bats. Taken together, our results demonstrate that subtle variations in the environmental conditions along a local scale gradient impact on the main dimensions of bat diversity in primary forests.",

Such descriptions usually lack observations on social behaviour including interactions between bats with aberrant pigmentation and other individuals. Here, we report the ﬁrst observation of leucism in the greater sac-winged bat Saccopteryx bilineata. Over the course of six weeks, we were able to follow the development of a wild pup with a conspicuous aberrant pigmentation, by observing it in its day roost. Our observations indicate that the vocal and behavioural development of the pup was entirely normal, as well as the integration into its social group. After six weeks, when the pup was already foraging individually, it did not return to its colony in the morning, indicating that it may have been preyed on.",

A total of 6400 bats was handled during studies of swarming at 10 hibernacula in Ontario and Quebec from 1966 to 1968. Juveniles comprised over 50% of the swarming population, and the proportion of females in this population was greater than that observed in hibernating populations. Two phases of swarming have been distinguished: the first, occurring in August, lacks both sexual activity and a hibernating population, and the second, which begins in September, involves both sexual activity and the buildup of a hibernating population. Possible functions of swarming are discussed.",

The risk of species-­extinctions increases when pathogens can survive in the absence of the host. Environmental reservoirs can facilitate this. However, identifying such reservoirs and modes of infection is often highly challenging. In this study, we investigated the presence and nature of an environmental reservoir for the ascomycete fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative agent of White-­Nose disease. Using 18 microsatellite markers, we determined the genotypic differentiation between 1497 P. destructans isolates collected from nine closely situated underground sites where bats hibernate (i.e., hibernacula) in Northeastern Germany. This approach was unique in that it ensured that every isolate and resulting multilocus genotype was not only present, but also viable and therefore theoretically capable of infecting a bat. The distinct distribution of multilocus genotypes across hibernacula demonstrates that each hibernaculum has an essentially unique fungal population. This would be expected if bats become infected in their hibernaculum (i.e., the site they spend winter in to hibernate) rather than in other sites visited before they start hibernating. In one hibernaculum, both the walls and the hibernating bats were sampled at regular intervals over five consecutive winter seasons (1062 isolates), revealing higher genotypic richness on walls compared to bats and a stable frequency of multilocus genotypes over multiple winters. This clearly implicates hibernacula walls as the main environmental reservoir of the pathogen, from which bats become reinfected annually during the autumn.",

Known altitudinal range of this bat is from sea level to 3,150 m; most known records are from below 1,000 masl. We report the occurrence of Nyctinomops aurispinosus in Central America based on a recently dead male found in southern Honduras. The nearest localities where it has been reported are western Sonora and eastern Tamaulipas, México. The specimen was found at 1,239 masl on December 5th, 2014 in a disturbed oak-pine forest used for cattle ranching with some human infrastructure recently built in the site. We have registered several other species of bats in this study site, including N. laticaudatus, Eumops underwoodi, four vespertilionids and three mormoopids, most of them difficult to catch by mist nets. We add a new bat species to the Honduras list which now stands at 108 species.",

To unravel these cryptic taxa, studies now employ data from different sources under an integrative approach. We present an assessment of the cryptic diversity of the Lophostoma brasiliense species complex (Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae) based on multiple lines of evidence (molecular, morphological, morphometric, and geographic data) and using molecular (ABGD, ASAP, GMYC, and bPTP) and phenotypic (distancebased approaches and Normal Mixture Model Analyses) species delimitation methods. Our analyses recognized two distinct lineages with clear allopatric distributions. One lineage corresponds to Lophostoma brasiliense with a cisAndean distribution and the other to the formerly species Lophostoma nicaraguae with a trans-Andean distribution. The two lineages probably diverged from a vicariant speciation driven by the uplift of the Andes less than six million years ago. Our work also shows that the wide range of environmental conditions during the recent history of South America may have promoted restrictions to gene flow among the populations of Lophostoma brasiliense. Finally, we raised L. nicaraguae to species level clarifying the species limit and morphological characteristics of lineages, and we provide an emended diagnosis and comparisons between the two taxa.

Discrete and mensural morphological characters distinguish the new species from other ﬂying foxes in Southeast Asia. The new species shares several probable morphological synapomorphies with Desmalopex leucopterus, including features of the pelage, patagia, dentition, and cranium, suggesting that the 2 species are closely related. We present phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences, which support the taxonomic status of the new species and the recently revalidated genus Desmalopex. Together, D. leucopterus and the new species form a well-supported clade that may be sister to Pteropus þ Acerodon, or perhaps more distantly related to these genera. Discovery of the new species highlights the need for continued biodiversity inventories in the Philippines, where new taxa are being discovered at a remarkable rate.",

Acoustic surveys of bat activity were conducted on a 370-m grid with 50 stations that covered the entire island. We controlled for a variety of extraneous factors through sampling design and use of a generalized linear model. Bat activity was significantly higher in native and nonnative forests than in non-forest habitats. There was no significant difference between activity levels in the two forest types. However, our sample size in non-native forest was limited to seven stations, thus the conclusion that non-native forest is an important habitat for the species should be viewed with caution. Our finding that E. semicaudata may be reliant on forest is critical because forests on Aguiguan are threatened by feral goats.",

Here, we performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of evidence of Leptospira sp. infection in bats by examining studies published between 1964 and 2021. We reported the frequencies of various species and serogroups on all continents, several species and feeding habits of bats, and different diagnostic tools. Together, 33 papers from all continents with seven to 2077 individuals from one to 31 species were included. Molecular detection was conducted in most studies, followed by MAT (Microscopic Agglutination Test) and isolation and identification. Molecular characterization of Leptospira sp. revealed L. borgpetersenii as the most frequent species. Moreover, 179 positive samples for MAT contained the most likely infecting serogroups described, particularly the Australis serogroup. The percentage of positive tests in isolation and identification ranged between 0% and 0.5%. The highest frequency of Leptospira infection among the continents was observed in Asia, whereas South America had the lowest percentage. Finally, Nycteridae and Rhinonycteridae were the most frequently infected bat families. Our study provides valuable information about the epidemiology of Leptospira sp. infection in bats.",

Therefore, to determine optimal alternative roosts, we studied roost preference of this species by testing the effects of roost temperature, surrounding environment and the distance from the nearest nursery colony on roost selection by V. sinensis in manipulative field experiments. We installed white (cooler) and black (warmer) bat boxes at shaded and sun-exposed sites. Although no nursery colonies were formed in the bat boxes, a few individuals (1–5) roosted during the lactation period, while many individuals (≥20) roosted during the postlactation period. During lactation, bats used both white and black boxes, but preferred using the boxes placed at the shaded sites over those placed at the sun-exposed sites. On the other hand, during the post-lactation period, almost all individuals used the white boxes rather than the black boxes. However, adult females preferred the shaded sites while young females preferred the sun-exposed sites. In conclusion, V. sinensis exhibited seasonal changes in roost selection, implying that several types of bat boxes in different environments need to be installed as alternative roosts. In the future, other types of bat boxes should be tested as alternative nursery roosts.",

To test this prediction, we characterized the behavior of visitors toward flowers and their pollination effectiveness.\n              Coereba flaveola\n              (bananaquits) was the most frequent flower visitor and acted as a primary nectar robber; however, they pollinated incidentally and deposited pollen on stigmas. The endemic short‐billed hummingbird\n              Chlorostilbon maugaeus\n              behaved as a secondary robber and did not pollinate flowers. As expected, the long‐billed hummingbird,\n              Anthracothorax viridis\n              , was the most efficient visitor in terms of pollen deposition; however, it was the least frequent flower visitor. Introduced\n              Apis mellifera\n              (honeybees) were second in efficiency at depositing pollen and performed one third of the flower visits. Estimates of the expected rate of pollen deposition by each pollinator did not identify a single most effective pollinator. For\n              P. angustifolia\n              at least three flower visitors including an exotic bee and a nectar robber may be equally important to reproductive success. While these results limit our ability to make predictions on the role of hummingbird‐pollination on current flower evolution, they do suggest the potential for pollination redundancy among flower visitors for\n              P. angustifolia\n              populations.",

The composition of the E poliocephalus diet and diet specialization in the species are therefore pertinent to studies of trophic structure, seed dispersal and evolutionary processes in these forests. During a three-year diet study, P. poliocephalus used fruits from 44 species of canopy and edge plants. Their taxonomically diverse diet was dominated by the Myrtaceae and Moraceae. Dietary specialization by P. poliocephalus was examined using two criteria: the influence of fruit morphology on diet choice and dietary overlap with sympatric avian frugivores. There was no evidence from either approach that they were specialist feeders. Initial analyses comparing the morphological characters of diet fruits with fruits available to P. poliocephalus during the study period showed a preference for white fruits, berries, syconia and fruits with multiple seeds, and avoidance of black fruits and drupes. However, these significant results were not sustained when the confounding effects of correlations between fruit morphology and other traits were considered. All, except the response to berries, could be attributed to either avoidance by /? poliocephalus c>/secondary compounds in the Lauraceae or selection for the beneficial phenolog\\' of Eiciis. Dietary overlap with frugivorous birds was notably high and the fruit diet of P. poliocephalus formed a subset of the avian diet. Associations between fruit colour, size and protective mechanisms have been documented in other rainforest areas and have been proposed as indicators of coadaptive relationships between vertebrate frugivores and their diet plants. However, these associations were not apparent in the morphological characters of fleshy fruits from Australian subtropical rainforest trees. An explanatory hypothesis of primarily avian influence on fruit traits is presented.",

            "abstractNote": "The Grey-headed Flying-fox Pteropus poliocephalus has an expansive range. However, the species actually occupies a relatively restricted and continuously changing habitat area, which is primarily defined by irregular patterns of nectar availability. A synchronous count of Greyheaded Flying-foxes in New South Wales taken in July 1988 described the distribution and abundance of the species during a time of general food scarcity, but when abundant floral resources were available in restricted patches of coastal vegetation.The population was highly concentrated into small habitat areas associated with this flowering. The species occupied 11 camps which were located at irregular intervals along the coast, north from the Sydney region. Over 99% of the New South Wales population occurred in nine camps. The total abundance of animals in the state was estimated at 85 400. These results vary substantially from recent estimations which placed the size of the New South Wales population at one million animals. Black Flying-foxes occupied seven camps at the time of the count and their abundance was estimated at 72 500. Periods of concentration are periods of vulnerability for migratory species and present appropriate circumstances in which to examine their conservation status. Critical winter habitat used by Grey-headed Flying-foxes at the time of this study is poorly reserved, primarily occurs on privately-owned land and is iocated in areas targeted for urban and rural residential development to cater for an ongoing, rapid increase in human population. The conclusion drawn from this study was that Grey-headed Flying-foxes are vulnerable to population decline from the ongoing clearing of their critical over-wintering habitat in lowland coastal vegetation in north-east New South Wales and south-east Oueensland. These results support their listing as VuineraMe in the 1999 Action Plan for Australian Bats.",

In an attempt to address some of the conservation challenges faced by this species, we studied the genetic structure and dispersal of intra‐ and interisland populations using six species‐specific microsatellite markers. In particular, we sought to establish the relationship between island populations and to define effective management units for conservation. Pairwise co‐ancestry index (\n              F\n              ST\n              ) analysis, analysis of molecular variance, and Bayesian clustering suggested the presence of significant genetic differentiation between islands but little differentiation within them. The small Yonaguni Island population appeared to be not only geographically isolated, but also genetically isolated. This population is at the greatest risk of extinction, considering its size and low genetic variation. The larger populations on Iriomote and Ishigaki Islands are genetically related to each other to a greater degree and exhibit higher genetic variation than the Yonaguni Island population. This suggests that these two island populations should be included in a single management unit, while bats from Yonaguni Island should be managed independently and given higher priority for conservation. Actions such as defining vegetation corridors between colonies, as well as building gates at the entrance of the largest known colony, should be included in the conservation agenda of this still poorly known species.",

Because bats often occupy perennial day-roosts, they might adapt their responsiveness according to the social relevance in which distress calls are broadcast. Specifically, we hypothesized that conspecific distress calls broadcast within or in proximity to the day-roost would elicit a stronger responsiveness than distress calls broadcast at a foraging site. We analysed the distress calls and conducted playback experiments with the greater sac-winged bat,\n              Saccopteryx bilineata\n              , which occupies perennial day-roosts with a stable social group composition.\n              S. bilineata\n              reacted significantly differently depending on the playback's location. Bats were attracted to distress call playbacks within the day-roost and in proximity to it, but showed no obvious response to distress call playbacks at a foraging site. Hence, the bats adapted their responsiveness towards distress calls depending on the social relevance in which distress calls were broadcast. Distress calls within or in proximity to the day-roost are probably perceived as a greater threat and thus have a higher behavioural relevance than distress calls at foraging sites, either because bats want to assess the predation risk or because they engage in mobbing behaviour.",

The p38\n              MAPK\n              pathway was not apparently activated in heart during torpor but skeletal muscle showed strong increases (2.2–11‐fold) in the amounts of phosphorylated p38\n              T180/Y182\n              , CREB\n              S133\n              , ATF‐\n              2T69/71\n              and Elk‐1\n              S383\n              in the torpid versus aroused state. By contrast both total and phosphorylated levels of Elk‐1 in heart were reduced during hibernation to just 30% of the euthermic values. These data implicate p38\n              MAPK\n              and its transcription factor targets, CREB, ATF‐2 and Elk‐1 in skeletal muscle maintenance during hibernation.

            "abstractNote": "Hendra virus (HeV) continues to cause fatal infection in horses and threaten infection in close-contact humans in eastern Australia. Species of Pteropus bats (flying-foxes) are the natural reservoir of the virus. We caught and sampled flying-foxes from a multispecies roost in southeast Queensland, Australia on eight occasions between June 2013 and June 2014. The effects of sample date, species, sex, age class, body condition score (BCS), pregnancy and lactation on HeV antibody prevalence, log-transformed median fluorescent intensity (lnMFI) values and HeV RNA status were assessed using unbalanced generalised linear models. A total of 1968 flying-foxes were sampled, comprising 1012 Pteropus alecto, 742 P. poliocephalus and 214 P. scapulatus. Sample date, species and age class were each statistically associated with HeV RNA status, antibody status and lnMFI values; BCS was statistically associated with HeV RNA status and antibody status. The findings support immunologically naïve sub-adult P. alecto playing an important role in maintaining HeV infection at a population level. The biological significance of the association between BCS and HeV RNA status, and BCS and HeV antibody status, is less clear and warrants further investigation. Contrary to previous studies, we found no direct association between HeV infection and pregnancy or lactation. The findings in P. poliocephalus suggest that HeV exposure in this species may not result in systemic infection and virus excretion, or alternatively, may reflect assay cross-reactivity with another (unidentified) henipavirus.",

As such, little brown bats are the focus of monitoring and research initiatives that often include capturing and handling free-ranging individuals. We examined the stress response of 198 adult female little brown bats after being captured from three bat houses, during the summer. Our objective was to inform best practices to researchers capturing and handling bats in the wild. We compared the stress response among bats held for &lt;3 min (baseline), 15–30 min, or &gt;30 min, and then among bats held alone or in a group with conspecifics. We measured the levels of plasma total and free cortisol, maximum corticosteroid binding capacity (MCBC), and blood glucose. Relative to baseline, total and free cortisol levels were significantly higher in bats held for 15–30 min and higher still in those held for &gt; 30 min. Blood glucose levels were elevated after &gt;30 min of holding. MCBC levels showed no differences among holding times. We detected a weak effect of social holding condition, with solitary-held bats having lower total cortisol levels than group-held bats, but MCBC, free cortisol, and blood glucose levels showed no effect of social holding condition. Our findings demonstrate that capture time should be minimized and suggest that little brown bats should be handled and released within 30 min of capture as means of reducing stress. Further, solitary holding did not appear to increase stress measures, which supports holding bats individually after capture, instead of in groups, to reduce risk of pathogen and parasite transmission.",

Since 2005, eight taxa have been documented as distinct from the 19 previously known species. We describe three new species of Murina collected in southern China between 2004 and 2007. These species differ morphologically, morphometrically, and genetically from previously described species of Murina. Morphological differences include pelage color, size, skull shape and tooth morphology. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA barcodes of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene supports species status based on divergent phylogenetic lineages.",

            "abstractNote": "Ex situ (captive) management can facilitate species recovery, but this approach is invasive and is not universally appropriate. Evidence-based approaches are critical to determining whether ex situ approaches will be effective, but in many cases biological and ecological data from threatened populations are scarce. We generated a structured set of general biological and social/logistical criteria required for captive management to beneﬁt threatened, free-ranging populations. We illustrate how these criteria can be applied using a case study where populations are severely threatened, but demographic data are scarce (white-nose syndrome in Canadian bats). Using (1) population viability modelling (PVA), (2) a survey of Canadian zoos and wildlife rehabilitators, and (3) literature reviews, we identiﬁed two of our ﬁve initial target species as potential candidates for captive management. PVA revealed that sustainable captive colonies require high adult survivorship relative to free-ranging populations. Our survey and literature reviews showed that Canadian zoos and wildlife rehabilitators are enthusiastic about bat conservation. However, none could currently maintain the target species, due to limited infrastructure and/ or knowledge gaps related to husbandry and reintroduction of captive bats to the wild. Captive management is unlikely to stabilize target populations because released bats risk re-infection. We conclude that ex situ management is not an appropriate tool in our case study, and would represent ineffective use of available conservation resources. However, development of captive husbandry and re-introduction methods for hibernating, insectivorous bats would contribute to our global capacity to conserve similar species.",

We hypothesized that in bat white-nose syndrome (WNS), species-specific host–pathogen interactions may partly explain varying disease outcomes among host species. We characterized bat and pathogen transcriptomes in paired samples of lesion-positive and lesion-negative wing tissue from bats infected with Pseudogymnoascus destructans in three parallel experiments. The first two experiments analyzed samples collected from the susceptible Nearctic Myotis lucifugus and the less-susceptible Nearctic Eptesicus fuscus, following experimental infection and hibernation in captivity under controlled conditions. The third experiment applied the same analyses to paired samples from infected, free-ranging Myotis myotis, a less susceptible, Palearctic species, following natural infection and hibernation (n = 8 sample pairs/species). Gene expression by P. destructans was similar among the three host species despite varying environmental conditions among the three experiments and was similar within each host species between saprophytic contexts (superficial growth on wings) and pathogenic contexts (growth in lesions on the same wings). In contrast, we observed qualitative variation in host response: M. lucifugus and M. myotis exhibited systemic responses to infection, while E. fuscus upregulated a remarkably localized response. Our results suggest potential phylogenetic determinants of response to WNS and can inform further studies of context-dependent host–pathogen interactions.",

For multihost pathogens where pathogen virulence or host susceptibility is variable, host–pathogen interactions in tolerant species may identify potential avenues for adaptive evolution in recently exposed, susceptible hosts. For example, the fungus\n              Pseudogymnoascus destructans\n              causes white‐nose syndrome (\n              WNS\n              ) in hibernating bats and is responsible for catastrophic declines in some species in North America, where it was recently introduced. Bats in Europe and Asia, where the pathogen is endemic, are only mildly affected. Different environmental conditions among Nearctic and Palearctic hibernacula have been proposed as an explanation for variable disease outcomes, but this hypothesis has not been experimentally tested. We report the first controlled, experimental investigation of response to\n              P. destructans\n              in a tolerant, European species of bat (the greater mouse‐eared bat,\n              Myotis myotis\n              ). We compared body condition, disease outcomes and gene expression in control (sham‐exposed) and exposed\n              M. myotis\n              that hibernated under controlled environmental conditions following treatment. Tolerant\n              M. myotis\n              experienced extremely limited fungal growth and did not exhibit symptoms of\n              WNS\n              . However, we detected no differential expression of genes associated with immune response in exposed bats, indicating that immune response does not drive tolerance of\n              P. destructans\n              in late hibernation. Variable responses to\n              P. destructans\n              among bat species cannot be attributed solely to environmental or ecological factors. Instead, our results implicate coevolution with the pathogen, and highlight the dynamic nature of the “white‐nose syndrome transcriptome.” Interspecific variation in response to exposure by the host (and possibly pathogen) emphasizes the importance of context in studies of the bat‐\n              WNS\n              system, and robust characterization of genetic responses to exposure in various hosts and the pathogen should precede any attempts to use particular bat species as generalizable “model hosts.”",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding physiological limits and environmental optima is critical to developing protection strategies for endangered and threatened species. One theory to explain the decline in endangered Indiana bat Myotis sodalis populations involves increasing cave temperatures in winter hibernacula. Altered cave temperatures can raise metabolism and cause more arousals in torpid bats, both of which use more fat reserves. In addition, ﬂuctuations in cave temperatures may cause additional arousals. Our objectives were to quantify the effect of temperature and ﬂuctuations thereof on torpid metabolism and arousal frequency in this species. Female Indiana bats (n p 36) were collected from caves just before hibernation, maintained in an environmental chamber that simulated hibernacula conditions, and had skin temperature recorded every 30 min throughout the winter. One environmental chamber containing bats (n p 12) was sequentially set at 8Њ, 6Њ, and 4ЊC over the winter. The second chamber containing bats (n p 12) experienced the same mean temperatures, but temperature ﬂuctuated ע2ЊC on a regular basis. Torpor bouts were longest at 4ЊC and were not affected by temperature ﬂuctuations. However, the temperature ﬂuctuations appeared to cause longer arousals. Other bats (n p 12) were individually placed in metabolic chambers to calculate oxygen consumption during torpor and during arousals. Torpid metabolism was affected by temperature; at 9ЊC, it was higher than at 7Њ or 5ЊC. Metabolism during arousals was not different among temperature treatments, but rates were almost 200 times higher than torpid metabolic rates. We calculated a winter energy budget and, from the energetic perspective, determined an optimum hibernation temperature (3Њ–6ЊC) for female Indiana bats. These ﬁndings suggest that hibernacula that provide these conditions deserve extra protection, although other factors in addition to energetics may play a role in temperature preferences.",

In this study, we investigated recent divergence of the sibling bat species Rhinolophus episcopus and R. siamensis, which share a partially sympatric distribution and have different phenotypic characteristics among populations. We combined neutral [microsatellite (SSR)] and adaptive [major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-­DRB locus] markers to investigate the evolution of adaptive markers and disentangle the relative effects of neutral and adaptive microevolutionary forces on this MHC gene region. Our results revealed a stronger level of genetic differentiation in SSRs than in MHC genes of both species, which indicates effects of balancing selection on the geographical variation of MHC genes. However, we detected significant correlations in genetic differentiation between MHC and SSRs in R. episcopus, indicating that demographic processes have influenced the level of MHC genetic diversity in this species. In addition, significant moderate genetic differentiation was detected in sympatric populations and no alleles were shared between the two species. Therefore, we speculate that these sibling species have been subject to independent adaptive evolutionary processes.",
