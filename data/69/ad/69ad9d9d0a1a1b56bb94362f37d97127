The signiﬁcant reduction in numbers from that period had led to its International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Status being up-listed to endangered status. The purpose of the study is to employ a contingency valuation method (CVM) to determine the factors inﬂuencing the decision to contribute and how much to contribute for conserving the Mauritian Flying Fox by the Mauritian public in the midst of the human-wildlife conﬂict (HWC). A household drop-off survey with a sample size of 525 observations was employed. Favourable environmental attitudes, higher perceived ability to contribute (PAC), better knowledge about bats, higher aesthetic value of bats and lower negativistic attitudes towards bats were found to increase the probability of contributing to the conservation of the species. Conditional on these results, individuals with higher knowledge about bats and perceived ability to contribute were found willing to pay more for conserving the species. The ﬁndings help us to draw attention on the perspective of supporting a preservation fund for the Mauritian Flying Fox.",

While direct damage (e.g. habitat destruction) is relatively well understood, many activities affect wildlife in less apparent ways. Here, we investigate how anthropogenic noise impairs foraging, which has direct consequences for animal survival and reproductive success. Noise can disturb foraging via several mechanisms that may operate simultaneously, and thus, their effects could not be disentangled hitherto. We developed a diagnostic framework that can be applied to identify the potential mechanisms of disturbance in any species capable of detecting the noise. We tested this framework using Daubenton’s bats, which ﬁnd prey by echolocation. We found that trafﬁc noise reduced foraging efﬁciency in most bats. Unexpectedly, this effect was present even if the playback noise did not overlap in frequency with the prey echoes. Neither overlapping noise nor nonoverlapping noise inﬂuenced the search effort required for a successful prey capture. Hence, noise did not mask prey echoes or reduce the attention of bats. Instead, noise acted as an aversive stimulus that caused avoidance response, thereby reducing foraging efﬁciency. We conclude that conservation policies may seriously underestimate numbers of species affected and the multilevel effects on animal ﬁtness, if the mechanisms of disturbance are not considered.",

On continents, the effects of logging are greatest on endemic species, presumably because disturbance is more likely to cover narrower distributions (the “cookie cutter” model). Islands hold disproportionate biodiversity, and are subject to accelerating biotic homogenization, where specialist endemics are lost while generalists persist. We tested responses of tropical island mammals to logging at multiple spatial scales, using a long-term experimental test in a Pacific archipelago. The most widely distributed ecological generalists did not decline after logging, and we detected no overall changes in relative abundance or species diversity. However, endemics with small ranges did decline in response to logging. The least mobile and most range-restricted species declined even at the smallest spatial scale, supporting the cookie cutter model for sedentary species, and suggesting that habitat change due to selective logging is contributing to biotic homogenization on islands.",

            "abstractNote": "Each year, two or three species that had been considered to be extinct are rediscovered. Uncertainty about whether or not a species is extinct is common, because rare and highly threatened species are difﬁcult to detect. Biological traits such as body size and range size are expected to be associated with extinction. However, these traits, together with the intensity of search effort, might inﬂuence the probability of detection and extinction differently. This makes statistical analysis of extinction and rediscovery challenging. Here, we use a variant of survival analysis known as cure rate modelling to differentiate factors that inﬂuence rediscovery from those that inﬂuence extinction. We analyse a global data set of 99 mammals that have been categorized as extinct or possibly extinct. We estimate the probability that each of these mammals is still extant and thus estimate the proportion of missing (presumed extinct) mammals that are incorrectly assigned extinction. We ﬁnd that body mass and population density are predictors of extinction, and body mass and search effort predict rediscovery. In mammals, extinction rate increases with body mass and population density, and these traits act synergistically to greatly elevate extinction rate in large species that also occurred in formerly dense populations. However, when they remain extant, larger-bodied missing species are rediscovered sooner than smaller species. Greater search effort increases the probability of rediscovery in larger species of missing mammals, but has a minimal effect on small species, which take longer to be rediscovered, if extant. By separating the effects of species characteristics on extinction and detection, and using models with the assumption that a proportion of missing species will never be rediscovered, our new approach provides estimates of extinction probability in species with few observation records and scant ecological information.",

We selected 6 late Pleistocene and Holocene sites that correspond to 18 different layers dated to between ca. 22 and 3 kyr B.P. Using indices of species richness and evenness diversity, we show that climate played an important role at some sites during the late Pleistocene and at the beginning of the Holocene, in that the richness and diversity of small mammals were closely related to the mean annual temperatures and landscape changes, and varied according to the different climatic ﬂuctuations detected (Heinrich Event 1, Bølling-Allerød, and Preboreal-Boreal). However, at the beginning of the mid-Holocene, the small-mammal richness and diversity no longer seem to follow any kind of climatic pattern, and the observed changes in some studied sites are more closely related to human activities. By contrast with similar studies carried out in other parts of the world, the changes in diversity in the Iberian Peninsula do not seem to follow a constant pattern during the late Pleistocene and beginning of the Holocene. Some of the changes detected appear to be related to climate (late Pleistocene), and others appear to be related to human inﬂuence (Holocene) on the landscape.",

            "abstractNote": "The microclimatic effect of bats roosting in bell holes (blind vertical cylindrical cavities in cave roofs) in Runaway Bay Caves, Jamaica, was measured and the potential impact of their metabolism on dissolution modelled. Rock temperature measurements showed that bell holes with bats get signiﬁcantly hotter than those without bats during bat roosting periods (by an average of 1.1 °C). The relationship is clearest for bell holes with more than about 300 g aggregate bat body mass and for bell holes that are moderately wide and deep, of W:D ratio between 0.8 and 1.6. Measurement of temperature decay after abandonment showed that rock temperature returns to normal each day during bat foraging periods. Metabolic activity from a typical population of 400 g bat (10 individuals) yields 41 g of CO2, 417.6 kJ of heat, and 35.6 g of H2O in each 18 hour roost period, and could produce a water ﬁlm of ~ 0.44 mm, that is saturated with CO2 at ~ 5%. The resultant rock dissolution is estimated at ~ 0.005 cm3 CaCO3 per day. The metabolic heat ensures that the focus of dissolution remains vertical regardless of geological controls. A typical bell hole 1 m deep may be formed in some 50,000 years by this mechanism alone. Addition of other erosional mechanisms, such as direct bacterial bio-erosion, or the formation of exfoliative organo-rock complexes, would accelerate the rate of formation. The hypothesis is developed that bell holes are initiated and formed by bat-mediated condensation corrosion and are governed by geographic distribution of clustering bats and their roosting behaviour.",

            "abstractNote": "The Sima del Elefante site, located in the Sierra de Atapuerca (Burgos, Spain), is an important Pleistocene archaeopalaeontological locality that has been excavated every year since 1996. At least two main infill phases have been identified: a first (TELRU) early Pleistocene phase that has provided a rich faunal assemblage, various stone tools and the earliest human remains from western Europe; and a second phase (TEURU) attributed to the Middle Pleistocene. In this paper, for the first time we present a description of the TEURU small-mammal assemblage and its subsequent biochronological, palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic implications. The small-mammal assemblage is highly diverse and comprises at least 17 species: 3 insectivores (cf. Erinaceus sp., Crocidura sp. and Sorex sp.); 4 chiropters (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus gr. euryale-mehelyi, Myotis gr. myotisoxygnathus and Miniopteurs schreibersii); 9 rodents (Myodes glareolus, Microtus arvalis, Microtus agrestis, Iberomys brecciensis, Terricola cf. atapuerquensis, Arvicola sp., Apodemus sylvaticus, Eliomys quercinus and Allocricetus bursae) and 1 lagomorph (Oryctolagus sp.). Such an association suggests a late Middle Pleistocene age (ca. 250-350 ka), a patchy landscape dominated by humid meadows and woodland areas, and mild climatic conditions. These results are compared with other proxies, such as the herpetofauna, malacofauna, large-mammals and charcoals, providing a new scenario for the climatic and environmental conditions that prevailed during the latest Middle Pleistocene in the Sierra de Atapuerca.",

            "abstractNote": "Paleontological investigations undertaken since 1965 by Montpellier and Paris teams in the Quercy phosphorites have led to the discovery of more than 100 homogeneous and well dated fossil faunas. Most of these faunas range between the late Eocene and the beginning of the late Oligocene. Different groups of terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals) have concerned anatomical, systematical and phylogenetical studies which complete our knowledge on the late Paleogene Western European faunas. The study of some species lineages well represented in these karstic fillings has permitted to refine the European mammalian biochronological scale. Paleogeographical and paleoecological aspects concerning these Quercy faunas have also been treated as well as their turnover dynamics (extinction, appearance, diversity). Taphonomical studies have recently started in order to better understand the genesis of fossil assemblages. Moreover, new collaborations have been solicited with the purpose to analyze the dynamics of karstic phenomena. Synthetic studies including geomorphology, taphonomy, sedimentology, geochemistry and magnetostratigraphy have thus been undertaken in a calibrated (a few ten thousand years) chronological framework.",

A de Bruijn graph is a compact representation based on short words (\n              k\n              -mers) that is ideal for high coverage, very short read (25–50 bp) data sets. Applying Velvet to very short reads and paired-ends information only, one can produce contigs of significant length, up to 50-kb N50 length in simulations of prokaryotic data and 3-kb N50 on simulated mammalian BACs. When applied to real Solexa data sets without read pairs, Velvet generated contigs of ∼8 kb in a prokaryote and 2 kb in a mammalian BAC, in close agreement with our simulated results without read-pair information. Velvet represents a new approach to assembly that can leverage very short reads in combination with read pairs to produce useful assemblies.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding mechanisms involved in speciation can be challenging, especially when hybridization or introgression blurs species boundaries. In bats, resolving relationships of some closely related groups has proved difficult due subtle interspecific variation both in morphometrics and molecular data sets. The endemic South American Histiotus bats, currently considered a subgenus of Eptesicus, harbor unresolved phylogenetic relationships and of those is a trio consisting of two closely related species: Eptesicus (Histiotus) macrotus and Eptesicus (Histiotus) montanus, and their relationship with a third, Eptesicus (Histiotus) magellanicus. The three sympatric species bear marked resemblance to each other, but can be differentiated mor­ phologically. Furthermore, previous studies have been unable to differentiate the species from each other at a molecular level. In order to disentangle the phylogenetic relationships of these species, we examined the differentiation patterns and evolu­ tionary history of the three Eptesicus (H.) species at the whole-genome level. The nuclear DNA statistics between the species suggest strong gene flow and recent hybridization between E. (H.) montanus and E. (H.) macrotus, whereas E. (H.) magella­ nicus shows a higher degree of isolation. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA shows a closer relationship between E. (H.) magel­ lanicus and E. (H.) montanus. Opposing patterns in mtDNA and nuclear markers are often due to differences in dispersal, and here it could be both as a result of isolation in refugia during the last glacial maximum and female philopatry and male-biased dispersal. In conclusion, this study shows the importance of both the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in resolving phylogen­ etic relationships and species histories.",

The mitogenome of H. alaschanicus is a circular molecule of 17,300 bp, consisting of a control region and a typically conserved set of 37 vertebrate genes containing 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22 tRNA genes, and two rRNA genes (12S rRNA and 16S rRNA). The mitogenome of H. alaschanicus is AT-biased, with a nucleotide composition of 34.1 A, 30.9 T, 22.4 C, and 12.6% G. In the 13 mitochondrial PCGs of H. alaschanicus, the start codon ATG is used in all PCGs, except Nd2 and Nd3 (which use ATT), and Nd5 (which uses ATA). Eight PCGs (Nd1, Cox1, Cox2, Atp8, Atp6, Nd4L, Nd5, and Nd6) use TAA as the stop codon, while the stop codon AGA occurs only in Cytb. Incomplete stop codons (T--) are used in the other four PCGs (Cox3, Nd2, Nd3, and Nd4). These findings contribute to our understanding of the nucleotide composition and molecular evolution of the mitogenomes of the genus Hypsugo, and provide more data for comparative mitogenomics and higher phylogeny in the family Vespertilionidae.",

            "abstractNote": "The Nicobar leaf-nosed Bat (Hipposideros nicobarulae) was described in the early 20th century; however, its systematic classiﬁcation has been debated for over 100 years. This endangered and endemic species has achieved species status through morphological data in the last 10 years. However, the genetic information and phylogenetic relationships of H. nicobarulae remain neglected. The generated mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (mtCytb) sequences (438 bp) of H. nicobarulae contains 53.42–53.65% AT composition and 1.82% variable sites. The studied species, H. nicobarulae maintains an 8.1% to 22.6% genetic distance from other Hipposideros species. The genetic divergence estimated in this study is congruent with the concept of gene speciation in bats. The Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood phylogenies clearly discriminated all Hipposideros species and showed a sister relationship between H. nicobarulae and H. cf. antricola. Current mtCytb-based investigations of H. nicobarulae have conﬁrmed the species status at the molecular level. Further, the MaxEnt-based species distribution modelling illustrates the most suitable habitat of H. nicobarulae (294 km2), of which the majority (171 km2) is located on Great Nicobar Island. The present study suggests rigorous sampling across the range, taxonomic coverage, the generation of multiple molecular markers (mitochondrial and nuclear), as well as more ecological information, which will help in understanding population genetic structure, habitat suitability, and the implementation of appropriate conservation action plans for H. nicobarulae and other Hipposideros species.",

            "abstractNote": "The immediate release of adrenal glucocorticoids can be crucial for an animal’s survival when facing a stressor, but constantly elevated or exceptionally high glucocorticoid levels are usually detrimental for health. Although baseline and maximal secretion of glucocorticoids are regulated within narrow ranges within species, plasma glucocorticoid levels vary largely across vertebrates. We asked what ecological factors affect baseline plasma cortisol levels (CortI) and maximum levels (CortMax) following a physiological challenge through administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Speciﬁcally, we studied whether seasonal ﬂuctuations in food abundance correlate with the capacity of cortisol increases in two phyllostomid bat species with contrasting feeding habits: the sanguinivorous vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) and the frugivorous short-tailed fruit bat (Carollia perspicillata). Both species coexist in habitats with various levels of seasonality (dry and rainforest). On a seasonal basis, resource abundance is more stable for vampire than for fruit bats, but previous studies suggested that daily foraging success may vary more for vampire than for fruit bats. CortI and CortMax varied seasonally in C. perspicillata from dry and rainforests, with the exception of CortMax in rainforest bats. Although we expected food availability to be stable year-round for vampire bats, we found CortI and CortMax of vampires to be higher during the rainy season than during the dry season. Also, we found CortMax to be higher in vampires from the rainforest than in those from the dry forest. CortMax of vampires were among the highest measured for a freeranging mammal; a pattern that could be related to the species’ vulnerability to starvation. We conclude that food availability modulates cortisol levels in free-ranging species that face seasonally ﬂuctuating resources; in species, however, that beneﬁt from food which is constantly abundant, other factors than food may become more important in modulating cortisol levels.",

The records were obtained between 2002 and 2009 in the Region of Murcia (SE Spain). This study brings the total number of bat species recorded in the region to twenty, the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) being the most cited, and the Nathusius’s pipistrelle (Pipistrellus nathusii) the least. The paper increases the known distribution of a great number of species and provides some data on the biology and behaviour of some of them. The use of different sampling techniques, along with echolocation call analysis, significantly increases the knowledge of the distribution of all these bat species, particularly of forest and fissure roosting species.",

However, the molecular characterization of key proteins in bats still needs to be explored further. In this study, we used cloning and bioinformatics to analyze the sequence of RIG-I, STAT-1 and IFN-β in the immortalized cell lines from Rhinolophus afﬁnis and Rhinolophus sinicus. Then, we treated different bat cells, mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF) and splenocytes with polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to assess and compare antiviral immune responses between bats and mice. Our results demonstrated that bat RIG-I, STAT-1 and IFN-β showed close homology with human, mouse, pig and rhesus monkey. RIG-I and STAT-1 were both highly expressed in bat spleen. Furthermore, IFN-β was induced by polyI:C and VSV in both bat and mouse cells. These ﬁndings have provided new insight into the potential characteristics of the bat innate immune system against viral infection.",

However, broad comparative analyses of sensory morphologies and their performance are lacking for diverse mammalian radiations.\n                \n                \n                  Neotropical leaf‐nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are one of the most ecologically diverse mammal groups; including a wide range of diets and foraging behaviours, and extreme morphological variation in external sensory structures used in echolocation (nose leaf and pinnae).\n                \n                \n                  We coupled 3D geometric morphometrics and acoustic field recordings under a phylogenetic framework to investigate the mechanisms underlying the diversification of external sensory morphologies in phyllostomids, and explored the potential implications of sensory morphological diversity to functional outputs and dietary ecology.\n                \n                \n                  We found that the nose leaf consists of two evolutionary modules—spear and horseshoe—suggesting that modularity enabled morphological and functional diversification of this structure.\n                \n                \n                  We found a significant association between some aspects of nose leaf shape and maximum frequency and bandwidth of echolocation calls, but not between pinnae shape and echolocation call parameters. This may be explained by the use of multiple sensory modes across phyllostomids and plasticity of some echolocation call parameters.\n                \n                \n                  Species with different diets significantly differed in nose leaf shape, specifically in spear breadth, presence of a midrib, and cupping and anterior rotation of the horseshoe. This may relate to different levels of prey type specificity within each diet. Pinnae shape significantly differed between species that consume non‐mobile, non‐evasive prey (broad rounded, cupped pinnae) and mobile, evasive prey (flattened pinnae with a sharp tapering apex). This may reflect the use of different sound cues to detect prey.\n                \n                \n                  Our results give insight into the morphological evolution of external sensory structures in bats, and highlight new links between morphological diversity and ecology.\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              A free\n              Plain Language Summary\n              can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.",

Reducing uncertainty regarding the actions and goals of conspecifics is especially important for group‐living animals.\n                \n                \n                  Bats are often highly gregarious and use versatile social vocalizations to mediate social interactions. These social vocalizations encode a substantial amount of ecologically relevant information, such as individual identity, sex and kin. Decoding this information enables receivers to make informed decisions on resource allocation, mate choice, territorial defence and cooperation. Erroneous decisions on such crucial aspects of bats’ social behaviour can be costly due to reduced reproductive success or survival.\n                \n                \n                  Increasingly complex social interactions require social vocalizations encoding more information which, in turn, could facilitate the evolution of even more complex social interactions. Evidence for the positive correlation of social and vocal complexity is available for several taxa but is currently very limited for bats.\n                \n                \n                  We conducted a phylogenetic comparative analysis to link the information content encoded in bats’ social vocalizations to the complexity of their social lives, that is the level of uncertainty associated with assessing individual identity. We focused on three different vocalization types encoding individual signatures (pup isolation calls, adult contact calls and male‐specific vocalizations). Information content in bit (i.e. the number of binary decisions necessary to discriminate among N individuals) was used as an estimate of vocal complexity; relevant social group size (i.e. the number of conspecifics whose identity a receiver could confuse) was used as an estimate of social complexity.\n                \n                \n                  Our phylogenetic comparative analysis detected a positive relationship between the information content of vocalizations and the respective relevant social group size. This relationship suggests a positive feedback loop between social and vocal complexity for bat vocalizations and highlights the importance of vocal information for negotiating fitness‐relevant social decisions of bats.\n                \n                \n                  In conclusion, our work suggests that social complexity drives vocal complexity in bats. Future studies on other hitherto understudied taxa are necessary to establish a comprehensive theory on the multi‐faceted co‐evolution of sociality and communication in the animal kingdom.\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              A free\n              Plain Language Summary\n              can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.",

Because the fungal pathogen persists in the hibernation site environment independently of the hosts, previous theory on spatial disease dynamics cannot predict\n                    WNS\n                    epidemics. However, the ability to understand factors contributing to the spread of white‐nose syndrome (\n                    WNS\n                    ) in North America is crucial to the management of infected and susceptible bat populations as well as the conservation of threatened and endangered bat species.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Utilizing recent theory on environmental opportunistic pathogens, we modelled the effect of (a) landscape clustering, (b) environmental conditions in hibernacula and (c) microbial competition on the spread of\n                    WNS\n                    . We used available, already published data to construct and parameterize our model, which takes into account the spatial distribution of hibernation sites, temperature conditions in both the outside ambient and hibernation site environment, bat population dynamics, dispersal and infection by the pathogen, which also has its host‐independent dynamics with the environment. We also consider the effect of outside‐host competition between the pathogen and other micro‐organisms on spatial disease dynamics.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Our model suggests that pathogen loads accumulate in poorly connected hibernacula at short host dispersal, which can help found the epidemic. In contrast, invasion of the landscape is most successful at long host dispersal distances, with homogenous hibernation site distribution and heterogeneous between‐hibernation site temperatures. Also, increasing the mean temperature across hibernacula increases fungal growth rate, leading to higher disease prevalence and faster invasion rate. Increasing spatial heterogeneity in hibernaculum temperatures results in the formation of disease hotspots in warmer hibernacula, facilitating more effective spread of the disease in the landscape. Cold‐adapted competing microbes can prevent invasion, and therefore, overwintering in cold hibernacula increases probability of host survival.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Sites that were suboptimal for overwintering prior to\n                    WNS\n                    may have importance in preventing local extirpations. Although the model is tailored for\n                    WNS\n                    , due to pressing need for results that can assist in planning conservation measures, these novel results can be broadly applied to other environmentally transmitted diseases.\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              A\n              plain language summary\n              is available for this article.",

Within a species, body size can vary substantially across space and time, and the mechanisms generating these patterns have been the focus of evolutionary and ecology research.\n                \n                \n                  Bergmann’s rule predicts a negative relationship between body size and temperature across the geographic range of endothermic animals; larger animals have a lower surface to volume ratio, which would allow for greater heat conservation. Despite the broad support for this pattern, its underlying mechanisms are heavily debated. Numerous alternative explanations have been proposed to explain why larger animals are found in colder climates and vice versa, including heat dissipation, environmental seasonality and resource availability.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    We used the Pallid bat,\n                    Antrozous pallidus\n                    , as a model to evaluate Bergmannian size patterns and the relative support for major explanatory hypotheses of geographic body size variation. We tested the hypothesis that geographic size variation is predicted by productivity, as opposed to seasonality, heat conservation or dissipation, or some combination of these processes. Additionally, we investigated the potential ecomorphological consequences of size variation in Pallid bats by determining if skull shape (an indicator of bite performance) varies with size.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Whereas we did find that Pallid bat populations in northern latitudes are composed of larger individuals, our results suggest that net primary productivity and, to a lesser extent heat conservation, best explain size variation throughout the western range of this species. We also found that skull shape in Pallid bats changes in tandem with skull size, with larger bats having cranial traits associated with greater bite force production.\n                \n                \n                  The results of our study indicate that variation in resource availability may be a key factor underlying spatial patterns in size, morphology and, possibly, feeding performance within wide‐ranging bat species.\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              A\n              plain language summary\n              is available for this article.",

Currently, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic causes greater public health concern. CoV diversity is due to the large size and replication mechanisms of the genomes together with having bats as their optimum natural hosts. The ecological behavior and unique immune characteristics of bats are optimal for the homologous recombination of CoVs. The relationship of spatial structural characteristics of the spike protein, a protein that is critical for recognition by host receptors, in different CoVs may provide evidence in explaining the coevolution of CoVs and their hosts. This information may help to enhance our understanding of CoV evolution and thus provide part of the basis of preparations for any future outbreaks.",

            "abstractNote": "Background:  Mixed-species groups in animals have been shown to confer antipredator, foraging and other benefits to their members that may provide selective advantages. In most cases, however, it is unclear whether functional benefits are a principal driver of heterospecific groups, or whether groups simply result from simultaneous exploitation of common resources. Mixed-species groups that form independently of environmental conditions may, however, evidence direct benefits of species associations. Bats are among the most gregarious mammals, with sometimes thousands of individuals of various species roosting communally. Despite numerous potential functional benefits of such mixed-species roosting groups, interspecific attraction has never been shown. To explore alternative explanations for mixed-species roosting, we studied roost selection in a speciose neotropical understory bat community in lowland rainforest in Costa Rica. Long term roost data were recorded over 10 years in a total of 133 roosts comprising both natural roosts and structurally uniform artificial roosts. We modelled bat roost occupancy and abundance in each roost type and in forest and pasture habitats to quantify the effects of roost- and environmental variability.\nResults:  We found that bat species presence in natural roosts is predictable from habitat and structural roost parameters, but that the presence and abundance of other bat species further modifies roost choice. One third of the 12 study species were found to actively associate with selected other bat species in roosts (e.g. Glossophaga commissarisi with Carollia sowelli). Other species did not engage in communal roosting, which in some cases indicates a role for negative interspecific interactions, such as roost competition.\nConclusions:  Mixed-species roosting may provide thermoregulatory benefits, reduce intraspecific competition and promote interspecific information transfer, and hence some heterospecific associations may be selected for in bats. Overall, our study contributes to an improved understanding of the array of factors that shape diverse tropical bat communities and drive the dynamics of heterospecific grouping in mammals more generally.",

WNS is associated with physiological changes in hibernating bats, leading to increased arousals from hibernation and premature consumption of fat reserves. However, there is evidence of surviving populations of little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) close to where the fungus was first detected nearly ten years ago.\nResults: We examined the hibernation patterns of a surviving population of little brown myotis and compared them to patterns in populations before the arrival of WNS and populations at the peak of WNS mortality. Despite infection with Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative fungal agent, the remnant population displayed less frequent arousals from torpor and lower torpid body temperatures than bats that died from WNS during the peak of mortality. The hibernation patterns of the remnant population resembled pre-WNS patterns with some modifications.\nConclusions: These data show that remnant populations of little brown myotis do not experience the increase in periodic arousals from hibernation typified by bats dying from WNS, despite the presence of the fungal pathogen on their skin. These patterns may reflect the use of colder hibernacula microclimates by WNS survivors, and/or may reflect differences in how these bats respond to the disease.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Temperate winters produce extreme energetic challenges for small insectivorous mammals. Some bat species inhabiting locations with mild temperate winters forage during brief inter-torpor normothermic periods of activity. However, the winter diet of bats in mild temperate locations is studied infrequently. Although microscopic analyses of faeces have traditionally been used to characterise bat diet, recently the coupling of PCR with second generation sequencing has offered the potential to further advance our understanding of animal dietary composition and foraging behaviour by allowing identification of a much greater proportion of prey items often with increased taxonomic resolution. We used morphological analysis and Illumina-based second generation sequencing to study the winter diet of Natterer’s bat (Myotis nattereri) and compared the results obtained from these two approaches. For the first time, we demonstrate the applicability of the Illumina MiSeq platform as a data generation source for bat dietary analyses.\nResults: Faecal pellets collected from a hibernation site in southern England during two winters (December-March 2009–10 and 2010–11), indicated that M. nattereri forages throughout winter at least in a location with a mild winter climate. Through morphological analysis, arthropod fragments from seven taxonomic orders were identified. A high proportion of these was non-volant (67.9% of faecal pellets) and unexpectedly included many lepidopteran larvae. Molecular analysis identified 43 prey species from six taxonomic orders and confirmed the frequent presence of lepidopteran species that overwinter as larvae.\nConclusions: The winter diet of M. nattereri is substantially different from other times of the year confirming that this species has a wide and adaptable dietary niche. Comparison of DNA derived from the prey to an extensive reference dataset of potential prey barcode sequences permitted fine scale taxonomic resolution of prey species. The high occurrence of non-volant prey suggests that gleaning allows prey capture at low ambient temperatures when the abundance of flying insects may be substantially reduced. Interesting questions arise as to how M. nattereri might successfully locate and capture some of the non-volant prey species encountered in its faeces. The consumption of lepidopteran larvae such as cutworms suggests that M. nattereri eats agricultural pest species.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Bitter taste perception is essential for species with selective food intake, enabling them to avoid unpalatable or toxic items. Previous studies noted a marked variation in the number of TAS2R genes among various vertebrate species, but the underlying causes are not well understood. Laurasiatherian mammals have highly diversified dietary niche, showing repeated evolution of specialized feeding preferences in multiple lineages and offering a unique chance to investigate how various feeding niches are associated with copy number variation for bitter taste receptor genes.\nResults: Here we investigated the evolutionary trajectories of TAS2Rs and their implications on bitter taste perception in whole-genome assemblies of 41 Laurasiatherian species. The number of intact TAS2Rs copies varied considerably, ranging from 0 to 52. As an extreme example of a narrow dietary niche, the Chinese pangolin possessed the lowest number of intact TAS2Rs (n = 2) among studied terrestrial vertebrates. Marine mammals (cetacea and pinnipedia), which swallow prey whole, presented a reduced copy number of TAS2Rs (n = 0-5). In contrast, independent insectivorous lineages, such as the shrew and insectivorous bats possessed a higher TAS2R diversity (n = 52 and n = 20-32, respectively), exceeding that in herbivores (n = 9-22) and omnivores (n = 18-22).\nConclusions: Besides herbivores, insectivores in Laurasiatheria tend to have more functional TAS2Rs in comparison to carnivores and omnivores. Furthermore, animals swallowing food whole (cetacean, pinnipedia and pangolin) have lost most functional TAS2Rs. These findings provide the most comprehensive view of the bitter taste gene repertoire in Laurasiatherian mammals to date, casting new light on the relationship between losses and gains of TAS2Rs and dietary specialization in mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "Introduction: Immediate responses towards emotional utterances in humans are determined by the acoustic structure and perceived relevance, i.e. salience, of the stimuli, and are controlled via a central feedback taking into account acoustic pre-experience. The present study explores whether the evaluation of stimulus salience in the acoustic communication of emotions is specifically human or has precursors in mammals. We created different pre-experiences by habituating bats (Megaderma lyra) to stimuli based on aggression, and response, calls from high or low intensity level agonistic interactions, respectively. Then we presented a test stimulus of opposite affect intensity of the same call type. We compared the modulation of response behaviour by affect intensity between the reciprocal experiments.\nResults: For aggression call stimuli, the bats responded to the dishabituation stimuli independent of affect intensity, emphasising the attention-grabbing function of this call type. For response call stimuli, the bats responded to a high affect intensity test stimulus after experiencing stimuli of low affect intensity, but transferred habituation to a low affect intensity test stimulus after experiencing stimuli of high affect intensity. This transfer of habituation was not due to over-habituation as the bats responded to a frequency-shifted control stimulus. A direct comparison confirmed the asymmetric response behaviour in the reciprocal experiments.\nConclusions: Thus, the present study provides not only evidence for a discrimination of affect intensity, but also for an evaluation of stimulus salience, suggesting that basic assessment mechanisms involved in the perception of emotion are an ancestral trait in mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "A central aim of neuroethological research is to discover the mechanisms of natural behaviors in controlled laboratory studies. This goal, however, comes with challenges, namely the selection of experimental paradigms that allow full expression of natural behaviors. Here, we explore this problem in echolocating bats that evolved Doppler shift compensation (DSC) of sonar vocalizations to yield close matching between echo frequency and hearing sensitivity. We ask if behavioral tasks influence the precision of DSC in Pratt’s roundleaf bat,\n              Hipposideros pratti\n              , in three classic laboratory paradigms evoking audio-vocal adjustments: Stationary bats listening to echo playbacks, bats transported on a moving pendulum, and bats flying freely. We found that experimental conditions had a strong influence on the expression of the audiovocal frequency adjustments in bats.\n              H. pratti\n              exhibited robust DSC in both free-flying and moving-pendulum experiments but did not exhibit consistent audiovocal adjustments in echo playback experiments.\n              H. pratti\n              featured a maximum compensation magnitude of 87% and a compensation precision of 0.27% in the free flight experiment. Interestingly, in the moving pendulum experiment\n              H. pratti\n              displayed surprisingly high-precision DSC, with an 84% maximum compensation magnitude and a 0.27% compensation precision. Such DSC performance places\n              H. pratti\n              among the bat species exhibiting the most precise audio-vocal control of echo frequency. These data support the emerging view that Hipposiderid bats have a high-precision DSC system and highlight the importance of selecting experimental paradigms that yield the expression of robust natural behaviors.",

            "abstractNote": "Influenza A viruses are important pathogens that can cause diseases with high mortality in humans, animals, and birds; and wild birds are considered the primary reservoir of all subtypes in nature. After discovering the H9 influenza A viruses in bats, questions arose about their potential to serve as an additional natural reservoir and about the priority of the viral origin: Did the virus initially circulate in bats and then transmit to birds or vice versa? Influenza A viruses of the H9 subtype are of particular interest because fatal infections of humans caused by H5, H7, and H10 influenza viruses contained RNA segments from H9 viruses. Recently, a novel subtype of influenza A virus (H19) was reported and it was closely related to the H9 bat influenza A virus by its hemagglutinin structure. The genome of novel H19 has revealed a mixed characteristic genomic signature of both avian and bat influenza viruses. The time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) estimates have shown that the divergence time between the bat and avian H9-similar influenza virus occurred approximately at the end of the XVIII century. This article discusses the evolution and possible origin of influenza viruses of the H9 subtype isolated from bats and birds. The obtained data, along with the known data, suggest that the primary reservoir of the H9 influenza virus is wild birds, from which the virus was transmitted to bats. We hypothesize that the novel H19 could be a descendant of an intermediate influenza virus that was in the transition stage of spillover from avian to bat hosts.",

            "abstractNote": "Wildlife parasitic diseases represent an important field of investigation as they may have a significant impact on wild animals’ health and fitness, and may also have zoonotic implications. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of endoparasites in wild mammals admitted to wildlife hospitals and rehabilitation centres in Greece. Sixty-five animals belonging to 17 species and originated from various areas of continental and insular Greece were included in the survey. The most numerous animal species examined were hedgehogs (n = 19), red foxes (n = 16), and European roe deer (n = 6). Faecal samples were collected individually and examined by floatation and sedimentation method. Parasites were found in 46 (70.7%) of the animals. Most parasites found in canids, felids, and ruminants are of great relevance to the domestic animals’ health and some of them are also of zoonotic importance. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first report of endoparasites in hedgehogs, roe deers, fallow deers, badgers, and bats, and the first report of the pulmonary nematode Troglostrongylus brevior in a wild cat in Greece. The significance of the parasites found in each animal species in regard to their health and their relevance to domestic animals and human health is discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are natural reservoirs for both Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses and the hypothesized original hosts of ﬁve of seven known zoonotic coronaviruses. To date, the vast majority of bat coronavirus research has been concentrated in Asia, though coronaviruses are globally distributed; indeed, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-related Betacoronaviruses in the subgenus Sarbecovirus have been identiﬁed circulating in Rhinolophid bats in both Africa and Europe, despite the relative dearth of surveillance in these regions. As part of a long-term study examining the dynamics of potentially zoonotic viruses in three species of endemic Madagascar fruit bat (Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, Rousettus madagascariensis), we carried out metagenomic Next Generation Sequencing (mNGS) on urine, throat, and fecal samples obtained from wild-caught individuals. We report detection of RNA derived from Betacoronavirus subgenus Nobecovirus in fecal samples from all three species and describe full genome sequences of novel Nobecoviruses in P. rufus and R. madagascariensis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the existence of ﬁve distinct Nobecovirus clades, one of which is deﬁned by the highly divergent ancestral sequence reported here from P. rufus bats. Madagascar Nobecoviruses derived from P. rufus and R. madagascariensis demonstrate, respectively, Asian and African phylogeographic origins, mirroring those of their fruit bat hosts. Bootscan recombination analysis indicates signiﬁcant selection has taken place in the spike, nucleocapsid, and NS7 accessory protein regions of the genome for viruses derived from both bat hosts. Madagascar offers a unique phylogeographic nexus of bats and viruses with both Asian and African phylogeographic origins, providing opportunities for unprecedented mixing of viral groups and, potentially, recombination. As fruit bats are handled and consumed widely across Madagascar for subsistence, understanding the landscape of potentially zoonotic coronavirus circulation is essential for mitigation of future zoonotic threats.",

Albeit bats have not yet been trained to communicate via symbols with humans, we are convinced that some species, especially captive Pteropodid bats (“flying foxes”), show the potential to master this cognitive task. Here, we briefly review what is known about bats’ cognitive skills that constitute relevant prerequisites for symbolic communication with humans. We focus on social learning in general, trainability by humans, associative learning from humans, imitation, vocal production learning and usage learning, and social knowledge. Moreover, we highlight potential training paradigms that could be used to elicit simple “symbolic” bat-human communication, i.e., training bats to select arbitrary symbols on a touchscreen to elicit a desired behavior of the human caregiver. Touchscreen-proficient bats could participate in cognition research, e.g., to study their numerical competence or categorical perception, to further elucidate how nonhuman animals learn and perceive the world.",

These studies have led to important insights into problems of scene analysis, but not all of these insights are widely appreciated, and there remain critical shortcomings in current approaches that hinder further progress. Here we take the view that scene analysis is a universal problem solved by all animals, and that we can gain new insight by studying the problems that animals face in complex natural environments. In particular, the jumping spider, songbird, echolocating bat, and electric ﬁsh, all exhibit behaviors that require robust solutions to scene analysis problems encountered in the natural environment. By examining the behaviors of these seemingly disparate animals, we emerge with a framework for studying scene analysis comprising four essential properties: (1) the ability to solve illposed problems, (2) the ability to integrate and store information across time and modality, (3) efﬁcient recovery and representation of 3D scene structure, and (4) the use of optimal motor actions for acquiring information to progress toward behavioral goals.",

Here we detail the big brown bat’s adaptive temporal control over sonar call production for tracking prey, moving predictably or unpredictably, under different experimental conditions. We studied the adaptive control of vocal-motor behaviors in free-ﬂying big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, as they captured tethered and free-ﬂying insects, in open and cluttered environments. We also studied adaptive sonar behavior in bats trained to track moving targets from a resting position. In each of these experiments, bats adjusted the features of their calls to separate target and clutter. Under many task conditions, ﬂying bats produced prominent sonar sound groups identiﬁed as clusters of echolocation pulses with relatively stable intervals, surrounded by longer pulse intervals. In experiments where bats tracked approaching targets from a resting position, bats also produced sonar sound groups, and the prevalence of these sonar sound groups increased when motion of the target was unpredictable. We hypothesize that sonar sound groups produced during ﬂight, and the sonar call doublets produced by a bat tracking a target from a resting position, help the animal resolve dynamic target location and represent the echo scene in greater detail. Collectively, our data reveal adaptive temporal control over sonar call production that allows the bat to negotiate a complex and dynamic environment.",

However, we have little understanding of how chiropteran skin microbiota are distributed among bat species and their habitats, or of their putative roles in defending against Pseudogymnoascus destructans in China. In this study, we characterized the skin microbiomes of four bat species at ﬁve localities using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to understand their skin microbial composition, structure, and putative relationship with disease. The alpha- and beta-diversities of skin microbiota differed signiﬁcantly among the bat species, and the differences were affected by environmental temperature, sampling sites, and host body condition. The chiropteran skin microbial communities were enriched in bacterial taxa that had low relative abundances in the environment. Most of the potential functions of skin microbiota in bat species were associated with metabolism. Focusing on their functions of defense against pathogens, we found that skin microbiota could metabolize a variety of active substances that could be potentially used to ﬁght P. destructans. The skin microbial communities of bats in China are related to the environment and the bat host, and may be involved in the host’s defense against pathogens.",

Interestingly, some hibernating species, such as the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), appear resistant to the disease and their skin microbiota could play a role. However, a comprehensive analysis of the skin microbiota of E. fuscus in the context of Pd has not been done. In January 2017, we captured hibernating E. fuscus, sampled their skin microbiota, and inoculated them with Pd or sham inoculum. We allowed the bats to hibernate in the lab under controlled conditions for 11 weeks and then sampled their skin microbiota to test the following hypotheses: (1) Pd infection would not disrupt the skin microbiota of Pd-resistant E. fuscus; and (2) microbial taxa with antifungal properties would be abundant both before and after inoculation with Pd. Using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we discovered that beta diversity of Pdinoculated bats changed more over time than that of sham-inoculated bats. Still, the most abundant taxa in the community were stable throughout the experiment. Among the most abundant taxa, Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus are known for antifungal potential against Pd and other fungi. Thus, in contrast to hypothesis 1, Pd infection destabilized the skin microbiota but consistent with hypothesis 2, bacteria with known antifungal properties remained abundant and stable on the skin. This study is the ﬁrst to provide a comprehensive survey of skin microbiota of E. fuscus, suggesting potential associations between the bat skin microbiota and resistance to the Pd infection and WNS. These results set the stage for future studies to characterize microbiota gene expression, better understand mechanisms of resistance to WNS, and help develop conservation strategies.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat populations employ rich vocal repertoires for social communication in addition to emitting sound pulses for echolocation. Acoustic parameters of echolocation pulses can vary with the context in which they are emitted, and also with the individual and across populations as a whole. The acoustic parameters of social vocalizations, or “calls”, also vary with the individual and context, but not much is known about their variation across populations at different geographic locations. Here, we leveraged the detailed acoustic classification of social vocalizations available for the Great Himalayan leaf-nosed bat,\n              Hipposideros armiger\n              , to examine geographic variation in five commonly emitted simple syllable types. We hypothesized that individuals within geographically dispersed populations communicate using spectrographically similar constructs or “syllable types”. We also examined whether call syllables vary discordantly with the correlation pattern observed for echolocation pulses across those same geographic regions. Furthermore, we postulated that the acoustic boundaries of a syllable type are not uniquely constrained to its variation within a particular population of the same subspecies. To test our hypotheses, we obtained recordings of social calls of\n              H. a. armiger\n              from nine locations within the oriental region. These locations were consolidated into five geographic regions based on previously established region-specific differences in the peak frequency of echolocation pulses. A multivariate cluster analysis established that unlike echolocation pulses, syllable types exhibit a relatively large variance. Analysis of this variance showed significant differences in Least Squares Means estimates, establishing significant population-level differences in the multiparametric means of individual syllable types across geographic regions. Multivariate discriminant analysis confirmed the presence of region-specific centroids for different syllable constructs, but also showed a large overlap of their multiparametric boundaries across geographic regions. We propose that despite differences in the population-specific core construct of a syllable type, bats maximize acoustic variation across individuals within a population irrespective of its overflow and overlap with other populations.",

It is tailored via evolution to suit conditions within the distribution range of each species, but the evolutionary drivers are not yet well-understood. Global patterns of humidity correlate with many aspects of bat ecology. We hypothesized that atmospheric absolute humidity could explain global peak frequency variation directly and indirectly via increasing species body size and bat species richness. These hypotheses were tested using Bayesian phylogenetic path analysis on 226 tropical and subtropical bat species. In line with our predictions, we found a positive total effect of humidity on peak frequency, which was dominated by the positive indirect effects via body size and bat species richness. We did not observe the negative direct effect of humidity on peak frequency, which was hypothesized based on atmospheric attenuation of sound. In line with our expectations, excluding the predominantly clutter foraging bat families from our dataset downplayed the importance of the richness-mediated route. To conclude, our findings suggest that indirect effects, owing to ecology and biogeography of bat taxa, play a major role in the global relationship between peak frequency and atmospheric humidity.",

These populations play a wider role in ecological interactions, are vulnerable due to their restriction to caves, and have a disproportionate conservation value. Current knowledge of bat caves in Brazil is still small. However, systematic monitoring of some bat caves in northeastern Brazil shows that they experience strong population fluctuations over short periods of time, suggesting large-scale movements between roosts and a much broader use of the landscape than previously considered. Spatio-temporal reproductive connectivity between distant populations would change our understanding of the use of roosts among bat species in Brazil, and important gaps in knowledge of long-distance bat movements in the country would be filled. Here, we used ddRADseq data to analyze the genetic structure of\n              Pteronotus gymnonotus\n              across nine bat caves over 700 km. Our results indicate the lack of a clear geographic structure with gene flow among all the caves analyzed, suggesting that\n              P. gymnonotus\n              uses a network of bat caves geographically segregated hundreds of kilometers apart. Facing strong anthropogenic impacts and an underrepresentation of caves in conservation action plans worldwide, the genetic connectivity demonstrated here confirms that bat caves are priority sites for bat and speleological conservation in Brazil and elsewhere. Moreover, our results demonstrate a warning call: the applied aspects of the environmental licensing process of the mining sector and its impact must be reviewed, not only in Brazil, but wherever this licensing process affects caves having exceptional bat populations.",

However, the full vocal repertoires of relatively few bat species have been studied thus far. The present study examined the vocal repertoire of the pale spear-nosed bat, Phyllostomus discolor, in a social roosting context. Based on visual examination of spectrograms and subsequent quantitative analysis of syllables, eight distinct syllable classes were deﬁned, and their prevalence in different behavioral contexts was examined. Four more syllable classes were observed in low numbers and are described here as well. These results show that P. discolor possesses a rich vocal repertoire, which includes vocalizations comparable to previously reported repertoires of other bat species as well as vocalizations previously undescribed. Our data provide detailed information about the temporal and spectral characteristics of syllables emitted by P. discolor, allowing for a better understanding of the communicative system and related behaviors of this species. Furthermore, this vocal repertoire will serve as a basis for future research using P. discolor as a model organism for vocal communication and vocal learning and it will allow for comparative studies between bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "Fluctuating asymmetry (random fluctuations between the left and right sides of the body) has been interpreted as an index to quantify both the developmental instabilities and homeostatic capabilities of organisms, linking the phenotypic and genotypic aspects of morphogenesis. However, studying the ontogenesis of fluctuating asymmetry has been limited to mostly model organisms in postnatal stages, missing prenatal trajectories of asymmetry that could better elucidate decoupled developmental pathways controlling symmetric bone elongation and thickening. In this study, we quantified the presence and magnitude of asymmetry during the prenatal development of bats, focusing on the humerus, a highly specialized bone adapted in bats to perform under multiple functional demands. We deconstructed levels of asymmetry by measuring the longitudinal and cross-sectional asymmetry of the humerus using a combination of linear measurements and geometric morphometrics. We tested the presence of different types of asymmetry and calculated the magnitude of size-controlled fluctuating asymmetry to assess developmental instability. Statistical support for the presence of fluctuating asymmetry was found for both longitudinal and cross-sectional asymmetry, explaining on average 16% of asymmetric variation. Significant directional asymmetry accounted for less than 6.6% of asymmetric variation. Both measures of fluctuating asymmetry remained relatively stable throughout ontogeny, but cross-sectional asymmetry was significantly different across developmental stages. Finally, we did not find a correspondence between developmental patterns of longitudinal and cross-sectional asymmetry, indicating that processes promoting symmetrical bone elongation and thickening work independently. We suggest various functional pressures linked to newborn bats’ ecology associated with longitudinal (altricial flight capabilities) and cross-sectional (precocial clinging ability) developmental asymmetry differentially. We hypothesize that stable magnitudes of fluctuating asymmetry across development could indicate the presence of developmental mechanisms buffering developmental instability.",

The post-ﬁre results in landscapes have shown positive beneﬁts for bat populations. However, prescribed ﬁres set in the winter may cause direct mortality of eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) populations that use leaf litter for roosting during periods of colder (<10 ◦C) temperatures. Therefore, we used controlled laboratory techniques to explore if eastern red bats arouse from torpor when exposed to cues associated with ﬁre (i.e., smoke and the sound of ﬁre). Through subsequent ﬁeld trials, we conﬁrmed latencies of ﬁrst response (i.e., movement or increased respiration), arousal, and ﬂight behaviors to the stimuli of ﬁre. We provide evidence of smoke inﬂuencing eastern red bat ﬁrst response and arousal through laboratory and ﬁeld trial results. Latencies of all behaviors were negatively correlated with temperatures and wind speeds prior to and during ﬁeld trials. We recommend prescribing winter ﬁres on days when temperatures are >10 ◦C to provide eastern red bats with a better chance to passively rewarm and react to an approaching ﬁre.",

We deployed passive acoustic monitors to record bat calls at sites representing six forest types at the Kisatchie National Forest in central Louisiana during two winter (January–February 2020 and December 2020–February 2021) and two summer (June–August 2020 and 2021) periods. We also collected environmental data at the landscape and local scales to help explain patterns in bat species occurrence. We detected big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red/Seminole bats (Lasiurus borealis/L. seminolus), Myotis species, tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis), and hoary bats (Aeorestes cinereus) during both periods, and additionally detected evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) during the summer. We observed seasonal differences in habitat use, and found that three bat species were more active during the summer in pine forests with group selection harvest, pine forests managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Leuconotopicus bor­ ealis), and pine forests that were clearcut within five years of our study when compared to unmanaged pine forests, thinned pine forests, and bottomland hardwood forests. Contrary to other studies, we found that the predicted probability of occupancy decreased with increasing proximity to riparian areas for four bat species, which could reflect the complex understory vegetation conditions that we observed along the riparian corridors in our study area. Our research identified forest characteristics and management practices that promote bat species diversity and activity in central Louisiana and demonstrated that pine forests with open understories and small openings in the canopy provide important foraging habitat for bats that occur in our study area and possibly other regions in the southeast.",

Because bat populations are declining, most likely due to habitat loss or fragmentation, it is imperative to understand the issues concerned with timber exploitation on bat conservation. We investigated the foraging activity of edge- and open-space foragers in relation to stand and vegetation structure, characteristics that are commonly affected by forestry. Acoustic surveys, culminating to 713 point count sites were undertaken covering 46 different forest massifs across mainland France over 6 years. We used generalized linear mixed models to analyse the activity of ten species: 6 edge-habitat and 4 open-habitat foragers. Pipistrellus pipistrellus was the most detected edge-habitat forager, while Nyctalus leisleri was the most recorded of the open-habitat foragers. Eptesicus serotinus and P. pipistrellus responded positively to heterogeneous vertical vegetation volume. In addition, P. kuhlii and P. nathusii responded negatively to tree basal area. Barbastella barbastellus, Hypsugo savii, and P. nathusii were associated with either ground deadwood and/or logging tracks and minor-traffic roads, confirming the importance of edge space. Finally, B. barbastellus, E. serotinus, and P. nathusii were positively linked to the presence of tree microhabitats. This study demonstrates that bat use in forests is complex and multifaceted. Maintaining ground deadwood and heterogeneity of vegetation, at the forest plot scale, should ensure the ecological functioning of exploited forest systems and the conservation of edge- and open-habitat foraging bats.",

Therefore, at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, we examined roost tree networks of northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) in forest stands subjected to prescribed ﬁre and in unmanipulated control treatments in 2008 and 2009. Northern myotis formed social groups whose roost areas and roost tree networks overlapped to some extent. Roost tree networks largely resembled scale-free network models, as 61% had a single central node roost tree. In control treatments, central node roost trees were in early stages of decay and surrounded by greater basal area than other trees within the networks. In prescribed ﬁre treatments, central node roost trees were small in diameter, low in the forest canopy, and surrounded by low basal area compared to other trees in networks. Our results indicate that forest disturbances, including prescribed ﬁre, can affect availability and distribution of roosts within roost tree networks.",

            "abstractNote": "Commercial coniferous plantations are often assumed to be poor habitats for bats. As a result, the impact of forest management practices on bats, such as clear felling, has received little attention, particularly in Europe. However, there is growing evidence from multiple regions that bats do make use of plantation landscapes, and as interest in siting onshore wind turbines in upland conifer plantations grows, there is an urgent need to examine whether felling prior to turbine installation is likely to put foraging bats at risk of collision. In the ﬁrst study of its kind, we use a ‘‘before – after – control – impact” study to explore the short-term impacts of clear fell harvest on bat activity in commercial plantations. Thirtyone mature stands of Sitka Spruce were surveyed using acoustic detectors in three large, upland Sitka Spruce plantations in Britain. Eleven stands were felled between 2013 and 2015, and 26 of the original 31 stands were resurveyed in 2015. The change in total bat activity and species- or genus-speciﬁc bat activity was modelled before and after felling occurred at both felled and control stands using generalised linear models. There was no change in overall bat activity at felled sites compared to control sites, but activity of Nyctalus species was 23 times higher following felling. Total Pipistrellus spp. activity doubled at felled sites post-harvesting, although this was mainly driven by increased activity at a few felled sites. When P. pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus were considered separately, activity increased slightly but nonsigniﬁcantly. The size of the felled area inﬂuenced activity (for bats overall and Pipistrellus spp.), with 90% higher activity in smaller felled stands (less than 5 haÀ1) compared to larger felled stands (greater than 30 haÀ1). For P. pipistrellus, activity in felled areas decreased with the duration since harvesting; the greatest activity occurred in stands felled within two months compared to those harvested more than 16 months previously. Higher activity for some groups following felling may occur due to the creation of more edge habitat, which is preferred by both Pipistrellus species we recorded. An increase in activity following the small-scale felling (‘key-holing’) required for the installation of turbines could put foraging bats at risk from collisions with turbines. Further investigation of the inﬂuence of both size of clear fell patch, timing of felling and changes in invertebrate abundance due to felling are required to establish the potential risk of key-holing and turbine installation to foraging bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Tree microhabitats – e.g. cavities, bark pockets or crown dead wood – have been described as key habitat elements, which are particularly important for birds, bats and xylobiont insects. They are therefore vital for promoting biodiversity in forest ecosystems. The occurrence of such tree microhabitats in forest stands is closely related to forest management. In Central European cultural landscapes, forest areas are subdivided into a mosaic of stands under different ownership types and owners vary in their forest management strategies and practices. However, little is known about the inﬂuence of forest ownership on the density and diversity of tree microhabitats in forest stands. In this study, we investigate tree microhabitats – categorised into 31 different tree microhabitat types – within forest stands in clusters of different ownership types. We compare small-scale private forests, municipal forests and stateowned forests in deciduous temperate forest ecosystems in south-western Germany. Our results reveal that the density of tree microhabitats per hectare is more than twice as high in small-scale private forests than in municipal or state-owned forests. Similarly, the diversity of tree microhabitats related to area is highest in small-scale private forests. Moreover, we found differences in tree microhabitat occurrences under the three ownership types at the single tree level. Besides ownership type, relevant indicators for tree microhabitats are basal area of forest stands as well as tree vitality and diameter. Within the study region, the share of tree microhabitats provided by small-scale private forests plays a substantive role for overall forest biodiversity. Management of publicly owned forests should promote a higher density and diversity of tree microhabitats to comply with goals of close-to-nature forest management approaches. In conclusion, we regard the type of forest ownership as a relevant driver of tree microhabitat occurrence. Ownership should therefore be considered in the design of policy frameworks and instruments which address the promotion of forest biodiversity.",

            "abstractNote": "The few studies that have assessed the long-term patterns of re-use of tree cavities by bats all concern North American bats. We studied long-term re-use of tree cavities by two species of European bat, Daubenton’s bats (Myotis daubentonii) and noctules (Nyctalus noctula). Cavities were inspected during consecutive years via direct capture of bats (more than 340 positive capture events, ca 2950 captured bats), observations of emerging bats, or by listening for bats during the early evening when bats emit typical vocalization (over 160 positive checks, over 450 observed bats). Between 1968 and 2007, we found 80 tree cavities used by bats (mostly excavated by woodpeckers) in the Czech Republic. Although more than half of the cavities were occupied for 4 summers, 28 cavities (35%) were re-used for 5–10 years. The longest period a cavity was used was 11 and 16 years for Daubenton’s and noctule bats, respectively. Sixteen tree cavities (20%) were occupied solely by Daubenton’s bats and 33 cavities (41%) were occupied only by noctules. The other 31 cavities (39%) were used by both species, either at separate times or simultaneously. Our data suggest that the larger volume of a cavity, the longer duration of re-use and the greater the probability of being occupied by both species. Continuous excavation of cavities by woodpeckers prevented the overgrowth of old cavities by calluses, which keep cavities accessible to bats. We suggest that woodpeckers may be the most important providers of suitable roosts for forest bats in Central Europe. Roosts were found in both economically valuable trees (Quercus robur and Tilia cordata) and less valuable tree species (Salix fragilis and Alnus glutinuosa). Economically valuable trees in our study area were long-lived and likely provide roosting habitat for longer periods but matured at a greater age. However, less economically valuable trees reached maturity and started to decay in a relatively short time, which may provide suitable cavities at a younger age. Maintaining both types of trees within forests may help provide suitable roosting oportunities for tree-dwelling bats in the Czech Republic.",

            "abstractNote": "Following decades of ﬁre suppression in eastern forests, prescribed ﬁre as a tool to restore or enhance oak (Quercus spp.)-dominated communities is gaining widespread acceptance in the Appalachian Mountains and elsewhere. However, the interactions of ﬁre with biotic components such as wildlife that might be impacted by prescribed ﬁre are poorly documented. For tree-roosting bats, ﬁre can enhance roosting habitat by creating snags and increasing solar radiation at existing roosts. In 2007 and 2008, we examined roost selection of forest-interior dwelling northern myotis (Myotis septentrionalis) maternity colonies in stands treated with prescribed ﬁre (hereafter, ﬁre) and in unburned (hereafter, control) stands on the Fernow Experimental Forest, West Virginia. Using radio telemetry, we tracked 36 female northern myotis to 69 roost trees; 25 in the ﬁre treatment and 44 in the control treatment. Using logistic regression and an information-theoretic model selection approach, we determined that within the ﬁre treatment, northern myotis maternity colonies were more likely to use cavity trees that were smaller in diameter, higher in crown class, and located in stands with lower basal area, gentler slopes, and higher percentage of ﬁre-killed stems than random trees. Moreover, roosts often were surrounded by trees that were in the upper crown classes. In the control treatment, northern myotis were more likely to roost nearer the tops of larger diameter cavity trees in early stages of decay that were surrounded by decaying trees in the upper crown classes than random trees. Roost trees in the ﬁre treatment were associated with larger overall canopy gaps than roost trees within the control treatment. Regardless of treatment, northern myotis maternity colonies roosted in black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) in greater proportion than its availability. Ambient temperatures recorded at a subset of roost trees in ﬁre and control treatments indicated that daily minimum temperatures were similar, but daily mean and maximum temperatures were higher in the ﬁre treatments, possibly due to larger canopy gaps created by the senescence and decay of the surrounding ﬁre-killed overstory trees. Northern myotis roost-switching frequency, distance between successive roosts, and duration of individual roost tree use were similar between the ﬁre and control treatments, suggesting similar roost tree availability despite a signiﬁcantly higher proportion of potential roost trees in the ﬁre treatment. Northern myotis readily exploited alterations to forest structure created by the reintroduction of ﬁre, which accelerated snag creation and enlarged existing or created new canopy gaps, but it remains to be determined if these conditions translate into increased recruitment and survivorship.",

We compared the characteristics of snags used as roosts (n = 26), with randomly located snags and random points (n = 52 and 50, respectively), at three spatial scales: focal tree, surrounding forest, and landscape. Snags used as roost sites by these bats differed from random snags for 19 of the 23 variables measured (P < 0.05). Logistic regression models were derived which suggested that the bats selected large snags, in open canopies, of intermediate stages of decay, that were located in upland areas, but away from water bodies. Bats may have selected roost sites for their thermal advantage in the mornings, as most used cavities or bark on the south and east sides of snags. To ensure that snags of appropriate characteristics persist for these two species of Myotis, forest managers in the northern Great Lakes forest region should retain, and manage for, large white pine (Pinus strobus) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) snags at sites in forests that meet these criteria. Such a regime is possible under a selection harvest that is normally practiced in these mixedwood forest types.",

In May and June, a continuous social vocalization of quite unusual structure and composition was recorded apart from these standard calls. Most of these calls were designed in a long “wavy line” pattern with the peak frequency of 14–36 kHz, and were accompanied by standard or modified echolocation calls. In one case we succeeded to supplement the acoustic records with a complete record of behavioural details: two bats slowly flew and followed one another in a circular path in front of the roost, where they repeatedly performed false landings, and during approaching one of them emitted the unusual social calls. This behaviour lasted for about 40% of the whole-night activity. The possible meaning is discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Forest managers often use thinning and prescribed burning to reduce the risk of wildﬁre and insect outbreaks. Because thinning and burning alter the structure of forest stands and may affect insect prey abundance, they may change the suitability of stands for bats. Our objective was to test the effects of thinning and burning on bat foraging and commuting activity in pine stands in the Clemson Experimental Forest in the Piedmont of South Carolina. We also tested whether vertical use of stands varied with treatment and whether activity of three common species varied among treatments. Twelve stands in the Clemson Experimental Forest dominated by loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (P. echinata) pine and at least 14 ha in size were selected and three replicates of four treatments were installed. The treatments were: (1) prescribed burning (Burn), (2) thinning to 18 m2/ha (Thin), (3) thinning to 18 m2/ha followed by prescribed burning (Thin&Burn) and (4) no treatment (Control). Bat activity was sampled with AnabatII bat detectors May–August 2001 and 2002. Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis), and eastern pipistrelles (Perimyotis subﬂavus) were the most frequently recorded species and activity was signiﬁcantly greater in 2001 than in 2002. In 2001, overall activity was signiﬁcantly greater in the Thin stands than in the Control stands; activity in the Burn and Thin&Burn stands was intermediate. Activity was also greater in treated stands than in the Control stands in 2002, but the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant (P = 0.08). In both years we recorded signiﬁcantly more calls at 9 m than at 0.5 m above ground but the treatments did not affect vertical use of the stands. Activity of big brown bats and red bats was signiﬁcantly higher in Thin stands than in Control or Burn stands, whereas activity of pipistrelles did not vary among treatments. Our results suggest that treatments that reduce clutter, particularly thinning, increase the suitability of pine stands for bats’ foraging and commuting activity in the Piedmont region. Thus, use of these practices may help to preserve the biodiversity of managed pine forests in the South.",

            "abstractNote": "Although it is well known that bats commonly forage in riparian areas, which provide water resources and insect concentrations, the role that the physical structure of riparian areas plays in influencing local bat communities is less certain. In 2000–2002, we used acoustic monitoring to determine bat species presence at 338 riparian sites in northwestern Georgia, USA. We used a 2-dimensional nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination to assess how separations among species were partially associated with riparian conditions. Our NMDS analysis found some degree of habitat partitioning among bat species occurring in northwestern Georgia and was dictated in part by riparian condition. Myotis grisescens and M. septentrionalis were associated with low-elevation lotic waterways, whereas M. lucifugus, Lasiurus borealis, and Eptesicus fuscus were associated with high-elevation lentic waterways with sparse canopy cover. However, riparian conditions had weak relations with NMDS axes, possibly resulting in coincidental associations in some cases. Regression tree analysis indicated that higher bat species richness was associated with apparently uncommon small, high-elevation waterways with sparse canopy cover as well as larger streams and rivers that had wetlands adjacent to them. Including high-elevation waterways with existing management recommendations for endangered M. grisescens foraging areas (large, low-elevation streams and rivers) will be the most effective conservation strategy to benefit the most bat species in northwestern Georgia and probably elsewhere in the southern Appalachians.",

We investigated differences in roosting behaviour between two cryptic species (common pipistrelle, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, and soprano pipistrelle, Pipistrellus pygmaeus) during autumn and winter periods. In total 463 bats were sampled in both caves and buildings with temporary occurrence during the period of late summer and autumn mating and presumable migrations from late July to September (10 sites), and in all known types of hibernacula from late November to March (34 sites). Sampling sites were located within the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia and Romania in areas where the two species occur sympatrically throughout the summer. Using a DNA-based identiﬁcation method, all but four individuals were identiﬁed as P. pipistrellus. It means that winter roosts of P. pygmaeus remain largely unknown in the area. Similarly, no P. pygmaeus was found in the “invasion” assemblages. Very abundant groups of P. pipistrellus in underground hibernacula and its exclusive occurrence in sites of “invasions” suggest that roosting behaviour during this time may be species-speciﬁc.",

The diverse foraging habits of bats expose them to different surfaces which may influence ectoparasite infestations. In spite of these, most studies often overlook dietary specialisations when observing ectoparasite loads. The present paper quantitatively investigates whether foraging strategies as well as other host characteristics (sex, age, trunk and patagial area) influence ectoparasite (nycteribiids and mites) loads of bats. Ectoparasite counts and morphometric data were taken from mist net captures of bats. We then developed and compared models for modeling bat ectoparasite abundance under various distributions using generalised linear models. The negative binomial distribution consistently proved to be adequate for modeling mite, nycteribiid and total ectoparasite abundance based on information-theoretic approaches. Generally, females and frugivores had higher ectoparasite loads conditional on bat sex and diet, respectively. Contrary to nycteribiid abundance, mite abundance was positively related to patagial area. Thus, our findings suggest that dietary guild, sex and patagia of hosts (as well as age-nycteribiid abundance) are significant determinants of ectoparasite abundance.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: The current investigation was aimed to clarify the correlations between the feeding strategy and lingual structure of the Egyptian fruit bat captured from the Egyptian east desert. Materials and methods: The current work was performed on 12 adult Egyptian fruit bats that were observed grossly and with the help of the stereo, light, and scanning electron microscope. There were three types of the lingual papillae: one mechanical (filiform) and two gustatory (fungiform and circumvallate).\nResults: There were seven subtypes of filiform papillae recognised on the seven lingual regions. There were few fungiform papillae distributed among the filiform papillae on the lingual tip and two lateral parts of apex and body while fungiform papillae were completely absent in the median part. There were three circumvallate papillae. The central bulb of circumvallate papillae was surrounded by one layer of two segmented circular pad. The lingual tip had cornflower-like and diamond-shaped filiform papillae.\nConclusions: Histochemical results revealed that the lingual glands showed a stronger Alcian Blue (AB)-positive reaction and gave dark blue colour, while the reaction for the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-stain was negative. Also, the glands exhibited a blue colour as an indication of positive AB reactivity with combined AB-PAS staining. (Folia Morphol 2022; 81, 2: 400–411)",
