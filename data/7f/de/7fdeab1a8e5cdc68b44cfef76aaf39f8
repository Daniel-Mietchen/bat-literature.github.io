            "abstractNote": "Primary and secondary poisoning of nontarget wildlife with second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides has led to restrictions on their use and to increased use of firstgeneration anticoagulants, including diphacinone. Although first-generation anticoagulants are less potent and less persistent than second-generation compounds, their use is not without risks to nontarget species. We report the first known mortalities of threatened New Zealand lesser shorttailed bats (Mystacina tuberculata) caused by diphacinone intoxication. The mortalities occurred during a rodent control operation in Pureora Forest Park, New Zealand, during the 2008–2009 Austral summer. We observed 115 lesser short-tailed bat deaths between 9 January and 6 February 2009, and it is likely that many deaths were undetected. At necropsy, adult bats showed gross and histologic hemorrhages consistent with coagulopathy, and diphacinone residues were confirmed in 10 of 12 liver samples tested. The cause of mortality of pups was diagnosed as a combination of the effects of diphacinone toxicity, exposure, and starvation. Diphacinone was also detected in two of 11 milk samples extracted from the stomachs of dead pups. Eight adults and 20 pups were moribund when found. Two adults and five pups survived to admission to a veterinary hospital. Three pups responded to treatment and were released at the roost site on 17 March, 2009. The route of diphacinone ingestion by adult bats is uncertain. Direct consumption of toxic bait or consumption of poisoned arthropod prey could have occurred. We suggest that the omnivorous diet and terrestrial feeding habits of lesser short-tailed bats make them susceptible to poisoning with the bait matrix and the method of bait delivery used. We recommend the use of alternative vertebrate pesticides, bait matrices, and delivery methods in bat habitat.",

It is mostly mechanically transmitted by tabanids and stomoxes, initially to camels, in sub-Saharan area. The disease spread from North Africa towards the Middle East, Turkey, India, up to 53° North in Russia, across all South-East Asia, down to Indonesia and the Philippines, and it was also introduced by the conquistadores into Latin America. It can affect a very large range of domestic and wild hosts including camelids, equines, cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs and other carnivores, deer, gazelles, and elephants. It found a new large range of wild and domestic hosts in Latin America, including reservoirs (capybaras) and biological vectors (vampire bats). Surra is a major disease in camels, equines, and dogs, in which it can often be fatal in the absence of treatment, and exhibits nonspecific clinical signs (anaemia, loss of weight, abortion, and death), which are variable from one host and one place to another; however, its immunosuppressive effects interfering with intercurrent diseases or vaccination campaigns might be its most significant and questionable aspect.",

The two subspecies are thought to be geographically separated. Due to their cryptic morphology, this hypothesis has never been tested and can benefit from being examined within a molecular framework. In this study, mitochondrial sequence data from 38 D. intermedius and nuclear sequence data from 14 D. intermedius from across their range were used to test the hypothesis that genetically defined groups correspond geographically with the two morphologically defined subspecies. Although high levels of divergence of the mitochondrial sequence (11.6%) suggest genetically distinct clusters sympatric in southern Texas, no genetic structure was recovered with the nuclear marker. Moreover, the mitochondrial sequence data recovered a paraphyletic relationship between the two subspecies of D. intermedius with the Cuban yellow bat (D. insularis), whereas no such paraphyly was recovered from analysis of the nuclear marker. Divergence time based on analyses of mitochondrial sequence for the two subspecies was approximately 5.5 Ma. The patterns observed are hypothesized to be the result of past isolation of lineages and secondary contact that is currently contributing to gene flow.",

            "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT\n            \n              The pallid bat (\n              Antrozous pallidus\n              ) listens to prey‐generated noise to localize and hunt terrestrial prey while reserving echolocation to avoid obstacles. The thalamocortical connections in the pallid bat are organized as parallel pathways that may serve echolocation and prey localization behaviors. Thalamic inputs to the cortical echolocation call‐ and noise‐selective regions originate primarily in the suprageniculate nucleus (SG) and ventral division of medial geniculate body (MGBv), respectively. Here we examined the distribution of parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB) expression in cortical regions and thalamic nuclei of these pathways. Electrophysiology was used to identify cortical regions selective for echolocation calls and noise. Immunohistochemistry was used to stain for PV and CB in the auditory cortex and MGB. A higher percentage (relative to Nissl‐stained cells) of PV\n              +\n              cells compared with CB\n              +\n              cells was found in both echolocation call‐ and noise‐selective regions. This was due to differences in cortical layers V–VI, but not layers I–IV. In the MGB, CB\n              +\n              cells were present across all divisions of the MGB, with a higher percentage in the MGBv than the SG. Perhaps the most surprising result was the virtual absence of PV staining in the MGBv. PV staining was present only in the SG. Even in the SG, the staining was mostly diffuse in the neuropil. These data support the notion that calcium binding proteins are differentially distributed in different processing streams. Our comparative data, however, do not support a general mammalian pattern of PV/CB staining that distinguishes lemniscal and nonlemniscal pathways. J. Comp.

Several species of bats have adapted to a variety of food resources and shelters in urban areas. This study aimed to detect Leishmania spp. DNA in bats present in forest fragments located in metropolitan areas endemic for leishmaniasis in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Brazil. Blood samples were obtained from 80 individuals, including eight species of Phyllostomidae and one species of Vespertilionidae. Thirty of the 80 bats were positive for Leishmania spp. using conventional PCR, all belonging to the family Phyllostomidae. Eighteen samples tested by real-time PCR (qPCR) using speciﬁc primers for the kDNA of Leishmania infantum were positive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report detecting Leishmania spp. in Platyrrhinus incarum in addition to being the ﬁrst reported detection of L. infantum in the bat species Phyllostomus discolor, Platyrrhinus lineatus, Artibeus planirostris and Artibeus lituratus. Our results show that bats can host Leishmania spp. in areas endemic for leishmaniasis, which must be taken into account in disease control operations by public health authorities.",

Their body surface can also be colonized by fungal commensals or carry transient fungal species and participate in their dispersal. The present study aimed to assess the presence of P. destructans in Northern Belgium, to describe the skin mycobiome of active bats during summer and autumn, and to analyze possible differences in fungal diversity among bat species, sampling sites, and seasons. In total, 114 bat specimens belonging to seven species were sampled from various localities. Culture-based methods revealed an important mycological diversity with 209 different taxa. Overall, a mean of 3.7 taxa per bat was recorded but significant differences were observed between sampling sites and seasons with a higher diversity in autumn as compared to summer. The mycobiomes were dominated by cosmopolitan and plant-associated species, in particular from the genera Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus. Other species known to be related to bats or their environment, like Apiotrichum otae, were also retrieved. Although P. destructans was not detected, the sampling of the hibernacula indicated that they can be inhabited by diverse fungal species including a yet undescribed Pseudogymnoascus species, distinct from P. destructans, namely P. cavicola, sp. nov.",

All cases were found during the day, in different neighborhoods, prostrate and unable to fly. No significant lesions were observed at necropsy or on histologic examination. The brains of the five bats showed strong immunohistochemical labeling for rabies virus in the form of large corpuscles or multiple clusters of granules within the perikarya of neurons in different areas of the brain, mainly in the cerebral cortex and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Three bats tested by direct immunofluorescence and mouse inoculation were also positive for rabies. These data demonstrate that M. molossus may be infected with the rabies virus and develop rabies, even without histologic lesions in the central nervous system, and can be a source of infection for humans and domestic animals.",

            "abstractNote": "The common vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus Geoffroy, 1810, is a species with an extensive geographical distribution, occurring in a wide variety of habitats. A recent phylogeographical study using molecular markers described a scenario in which this species is formed by 5 distinct geographically circumscribed mitochondrial clades. Here we studied the craniometric variation of the common vampire bat to assess the amount of subdivision within this species and to test for the possibility of distinct morphological patterns associated with geographical lineages. We used 16 measurements from 1,581 complete skulls of adult D. rotundus representing 226 localities in South America and Mesoamerica. The assessment of morphological diversity between groups was done by the estimation of minimum FST values. Overall, the results show that most of the within-species variation is a result of the size component. Both shape data and size data are correlated with geographic distances. Our results favor the origin of biological diversity as the outcome of genetic drift and stepping-stone pattern of gene flow instead of local adaptations to local environmental conditions. The FST analyses also support male-biased dispersal. The results give little evidence to support previous suggestions that the common vampire bat may be composed of 2 or more species.",

On the basis of histological sections, the structures of a pair of testis containing the seminiferous tubules of adults were compacted in organization with spermatogenic cells. The epididymis has a thinner muscular region than the vas deferens with longitudinal folds on the mucosal lining. Two portions were observed in the prostate gland, while seminal vesicle has numerous trabeculae and bulbourethral gland was observed to have multiacini. There was increase in thickness of muscular region, epithelial height, and luminal diameter of epididymis and vas deferens between adults and juveniles.

            "abstractNote": "Since 2006, bat populations in North America have suffered devastating mortality from an emerging disease known as white-nose syndrome (WNS). The causal agent of WNS is the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. In April 2014, WNS was discovered in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in Michigan, US, and has since been documented in 12 counties. Because current surveillance for WNS focuses primarily on mine-hibernating species in winter, it is subject to geographic, species, and seasonal bias. To investigate species affected and potential associations of gender, seasonal life cycle, and region with P. destructans prevalence, 1,040 rabies-negative bats were sampled from May 2014 to May 2015 from animals submitted as part of statewide rabies surveillance. The vast majority (96%) of the sample population consisted of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), a noncavernicolous species. Two methods were used to detect P. destructans: fluorescence of the muzzle, wing, and tail membranes under ultraviolet light and PCR targeting genomic DNA on wing samples. Only five bats (0.5%), all M. lucifugus, were confirmed positive after nucleic acid sequencing of PCR amplicons. No other species were infected. All infected bats were collected from April to May, coinciding with their emergence from hibernation. As P. destructans and WNS spread westward, novel surveillance streams may provide a useful tool for wildlife management agencies seeking to detect the fungus where winter hibernacula such as caves and mines are absent or otherwise inaccessible.",

Wild mammals are the natural reservoirs of these parasites, which are transmitted by hematophagous arthropods. The present study aimed to detect the natural occurrence of trypanosomatids through serological diagnosis, PCR of whole blood and blood culture (hemoculture), and phylogenetic relationships using small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), cytochrome b, and glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) genes. Samples from 131 wild animals, including rodents, marsupials, and bats, were sampled in six areas in the state of Maranha˜o, in a transition zone of semiarid climates northeast of the equatorial humid Amazon. Serological analysis for Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi was performed in opossums by indirect ﬂuorescent antibody test (IFAT), and all animals were serologically negative. Nine positive hemocultures (6.77%) were isolated and cryopreserved and from mammals of the Didelphimorphia and Chiroptera orders and positioned in phylogenies on the basis of sequences from different genes with reference strains of Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei and T. cruzi. From primary samples (blood and tissues) only one bat, Pteronotus parnellii, was positive to SSU rDNA and gGAPDH genes and grouped with the L. infantum chagasi branch. The studies conducted in Maranha˜o State provide knowledge of parasite diversity. It is important to determine the presence of trypanosomatids in wild mammals with synanthropic habits.",

The species is under threat from anthropogenic pressure on the little that remains of its forest habitat, now restricted to the islands’ upper elevations and steepest slopes. We report the results of the most comprehensive survey of this species to date, and present recommendations for ongoing field conservation efforts and monitoring. Morning counts were conducted at roost sites in the wet and dry seasons during –. Habitat structure around the roosting sites was characterized and roost numbers compared, to investigate the potential effect of habitat loss and degradation. We estimate the population to comprise c. , individuals distributed across  roosts on the two islands. All occupied roosting sites were restricted to a narrow altitudinal range, and roosting populations in agroforestry areas were smaller than those found in degraded and undisturbed forest. Only one of the  roosts on Anjouan was found in undisturbed, old-growth forest with no nearby signs of clearance for agriculture or landslides following tree-felling upslope. Following a suspected severe population decline as a result of widespread and long-term forest loss Livingstone’s fruit bat has been recategorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.",

Assuming that (1: hypothesis of the effect of the decade) the addition of new occurrence records over time increases the potential size of the species distribution; and (2: Wallacean distance hypothesis) over the years, the new points added are increasingly distant from the research centers. Considering the geographic knowledge gap of this species, our objective is to report a new record of this species and estimate its potential distribution in South America through environment niche models (ENMs). For this, we compiled records of occurrence of species, selected from 1900 to 2015. We used 19 bioclimatic variables available in the WorldClim database to estimate the potential distribution of the species, and we used three modeling algorithms: Maximum Entropy (MXT), Random Forest (RDF), and Support Vector Machine. To test the Wallacean distance hypothesis, we calculated the Euclidian distance from occurrences to bat research centers in Brazil, located using a national researchers’ information dataset (“Plataforma Lattes”). To test the hypothesis of the decade effect, we used the beta regression analysis, taking conservative and non‐conservative approaches. The results showed that the predicted area expanded and retracted with the addition of new occurrences over the decades, with an improvement in the accuracy of models. Most records are located in the southeastern region of Brazil, but algorithms predicted areas in regions where there are no records. Only the conservative approach has had a positive relationship over the decades. The distance from new points does not increase over the years of research centers.",

After a secondary peak in September-October observed in both sexes in E. isabellinus, in males only in P. kuhlii, body mass reached a minimum value in winter when activity is low. Significant differences were also noticed between years in June for both species. Such pattern of seasonal variations of sexual size dimorphism is typical of hibernating vespertilionids.",

From June 2010 to June 2011 two techniques, mist-netting and echolocation call recording, were implemented. This bat species was captured throughout the year but only at water bodies and particularly at Nouh basin. Captures peaked in late spring — early summer, and declined in winter. Pregnant females were captured from April to June, and lactating females in May and June. Echolocation calls were recorded throughout the year, but not every month in all habitats. Most activity was reported at water bodies and street lamps. Activity peaked in late spring and early autumn, and declined during winter period. Terminal buzzes were mainly detected at basins, peaking in late spring — early summer and early autumn. Our study provided further insights on the importance of water bodies which should draw particular attention in the management plan of the national park and in the whole country.",

            "abstractNote": "The efficiency with which flying animals convert metabolic power to mechanical power dictates an individual's flight behaviour and energy requirements. Despite the significance of this parameter, we lack empirical data on conversion efficiency for most species as\n              in vivo\n              measurements are notoriously difficult to obtain. Furthermore, conversion efficiency is often assumed to be constant across flight speeds, even though the components driving flight power are speed-dependent. We show, through direct measurements of metabolic and aerodynamic power, that conversion efficiency in the migratory bat (\n              Pipistrellus nathusii\n              ) increases from 7.0 to 10.4% with flight speed. Our findings suggest that peak conversion efficiency in this species occurs near maximum range speed, where the cost of transport is minimized. A meta-analysis of 16 bird and 8 bat species revealed a positive scaling relationship between estimated conversion efficiency and body mass, with no discernible differences between bats and birds. This has profound consequences for modelling flight behaviour as estimates assuming 23% efficiency underestimate metabolic costs for\n              P. nathusii\n              by almost 50% on average (36–62%). Our findings suggest that conversion efficiency may vary around an ecologically relevant optimum speed and provide a crucial baseline for investigating whether this drives variation in conversion efficiency between species.",

Physical and ultrasound examinations were suggestive of an abdominal mass with free ﬂuid within the abdomen. Based on the poor and deteriorating clinical condition of the animal, euthanasia was elected. Gross necropsy revealed an irregular thickening at the root of the mesentery and a diffusely, dark-red liver with rounded hepatic margins. Histologic examination revealed extensive neoplastic effacement of the pancreas with invasion into the surrounding mesentery and mesenteric lymph nodes and metastatic spread to the liver. Based on the morphology of the neoplastic cells, the involvement of the pancreas, and immunohistochemistry, a diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic carcinoma was made. Additionally, two small neoplasms were identiﬁed in the lungs. These masses were distinct from the carcinoma, and their morphology was consistent with bronchioloalveolar adenomas. This is the ﬁrst known report of either benign pulmonary lesions or pancreatic carcinomas in the order Chiroptera.",

Carcasses of Hutton's shearwaters were collected over three field seasons, and where predation was probable, the bodies were autopsied. Paired bites identified stoats as the principal predator of Hutton's shearwater, but also revealed that a feral cat was present within the colony. Stoats killed their prey with a bite to the back of the neck or head, and commenced feeding on the neck or head. Despite the limited number of catkilled birds, cats appeared to feed on Hutton's shearwaters differently from stoats, starting on the breast muscles. Harriers and kea left sign that allowed birds killed or scavenged by these native birds to be distinguished from those killed by stoats or cats.",

            "abstractNote": "Phenology refers to the timing of events in the annual cycle of organisms. For temperate-zone mammals, hibernation is one such event, but little is known about its phenology. Hibernation consists of energy-saving torpor bouts interspersed with energetically expensive arousals to normothermic T b, and hibernators should benefit from mechanisms which reduce arousal costs and help them time arousals to coincide with foraging opportunities. In a previous study, we showed that, in contrast to hibernating bats from warmer climates, little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) from central Canada abandon a circadian pattern to arousal in the middle of winter when there is no chance of feeding. Here, we used temperature telemetry to test whether they would re-synchronize arousals with normal foraging time (i.e. sunset) during late winter as the chance of foraging or emergence opportunities improves, and whether they would synchronize arousals with conspecifics, possibly to exploit social thermoregulation. We also used passive transponders to test whether energy reserves and/or sex differences in reproductive timing influence phenology and the sensitivity of emergence timing to environmental cues. In contrast to patterns in mid-winter, after 7 April 2013, bats synchronized arousals with sunset and with conspecifics. Females emerged earlier than males, and females in the best condition emerged first while body condition had no influence on male emergence timing. Both male and female bats appeared to time emergence with falling barometric pressure, a cue that predicts favourable foraging conditions for bats but which, unlike outside temperature, would have been readily detectable by bats inside the hibernaculum. Our results highlight hibernation traits associated with extreme winter energy limitation for insect-eating bats in cold climates and illustrate the influence of reproductive timing and environmental conditions on hibernation energetics and phenology.",

We provide detailed accounts of their external and craniodental morphology, including a suite of standard measurements, and compare the new taxa with all other members of the group currently recognized in Southeast Asia. The 1st new species was previously included in M. tubinaris (Scully, 1881) but is considered distinct due to differences in external and craniodental features. This new species is widespread in continental Southeast Asia and relatively well represented in museum collections, whereas the other new species are known only from a few specimens collected at scattered localities. The new taxa are known only from forested areas, which highlights the incompleteness of existing knowledge and strong potential for further discoveries in the region.",

This record expands the species’ distributional range in Mexico along the peninsula. We propose 2 plausible biogeographical explanations. First, the species has the ability to travel across the Gulf of California from the coast of Sonora to the eastern side of the Baja California peninsula and there establish. Second, there is a continuous distribution of the species throughout the mountain ranges that run longitudinally along the Baja California peninsula from the United States border down to the southern tip. We collected one male specimen of E. underwoodi in xeric-riparian habitat. We suggest a continuous distribution pattern of this species along the cliffs in the Baja California peninsula.",

Individuals of this species roost in tight clusters, and emit an acoustically rich repertoire of calls whose behavioral significance is largely unknown. We recorded their social and vocal behaviors within a colony housed under semi-natural conditions. We also quantified the spatial spread of each bat’s roosting location and discovered that this was relatively fixed and roughly confined to an individual’s body width. The spatial precision in roosting was accompanied by an equally remarkable match between specific vocalizations and well-timed, discrete, identifiable postures/behaviors, as revealed by logistic regression analysis. The bodily behaviors included crouching, marking, yawning, nipping, flicking, fighting, kissing, inspecting, and fly-bys. Two echolocation-like calls were used to maintain spacing in the colony, two noisy broadband calls were emitted during fights, two tonal calls conveyed fear, and another tonal call signaled appeasement. Overall, the results establish that mustached bats exhibit complex social interactions common to other social mammals. The correspondence of relatively low frequency and noisy, broadband calls with aggression, and of tonal, high frequency calls with fear supports Morton’s Motivation-Structure hypothesis, and establishes a link between motivation and the acoustic structure of social calls emitted by mustached bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Diurnal flight and foraging activity in insectivorous bats are atypical behaviours that have been recorded from islands with few avian predators and from locations with extended daylight hours. We present the first known observations of diurnal activity of Rhinolophus lepidus in forests on Tioman Island, Malaysia, recorded using visual surveys and acoustic monitoring. The bats were flying during the day and at night, and feeding buzzes detected suggest that they were actively foraging during the day. This appears to be a regular phenomenon on Tioman Island. The absence of resident diurnal avian predators that hunt below the forest canopy may account for the diurnal activity of R. lepidus in forests there.",

These parasites belong to the diverse group of malaria parasites, and Polychromophilus presents the only haemosporidian taxon that infects mammalian hosts in tropical as well as in temperate climate zones. This study provides the first information of Polychromophilus parasites in the lesser Asiatic yellow bat (Scotophilus kuhlii) in Thailand, a common vespertilionid bat species distributed in South and Southeast Asia. The gametocyte blood stages of the parasites could not be assigned to a described morphospecies and molecular analysis revealed that these parasites might represent a distinct Polychromophilus species. In contrast to Plasmodium species, Polychromophilus parasites do not multiply in red blood cells and, thus, do not cause the clinical symptoms of malaria. Parasitological and molecular investigation of haemosporidian parasites of wildlife, such as the neglected genus Polychromophilus, will contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of malaria parasites.",

This is only the third published dietary study of the species, considered to have a high conservation priority in Europe. Pond bats’ prey was dominated by non-biting midges (Chironomidae — both imagines and pupae) and caddis flies (Trichoptera). However, the spectrum of prey was relatively broad, with 16 taxa, including 12 recorded for the first time in the diet of M. dasycneme. Frequency of occurrence (O%) of particular taxa varied through the season. O% of caddis flies and non-biting midges in droppings were negatively correlated (rs = -0.75, P < 0.05); exceptionally high O% of caddis flies, being larger (and presumably more profitable) prey, occurred in late June and July, coinciding with high energy demands of lactating females. No evidence of piscivory was revealed.",

Animals can achieve omnivory using different strategies, for example opportunistic foraging, or switching between multiple trophic niches.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    The Neotropical bat\n                    Glossophaga soricina\n                    (Pallas, 1766) is a common and widespread species known for nectar feeding, but it also eats fruit and insects. Approaching stationary objects (flowers and fruits) or moving objects (insects) poses different sensory tasks and should require different echolocation behaviours. Here we tested the contrasting hypothesis that\n                    G. soricina\n                    can approach both stationary and moving objects using the same echolocation behaviour, thus feeding at different trophic levels by a single sensory mechanism.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Using\n                    DNA\n                    barcoding, we demonstrate that\n                    G. soricina\n                    eats beetles (Coleoptera), flies (Diptera) and noctuid moths with bat‐detecting ears. Laboratory observations show that\n                    G. soricina\n                    actively hunts for prey so insect consumption does not appear to be opportunistic. After capture, individuals consumed prey while perched and manipulated them with jaw, thumb, wrist and wing movements, but food handling was longer and chewing rate slower than in obligate insectivores.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    In contrast to most insectivorous bats, the echolocation calls of\n                    G. soricina\n                    are of high frequency and low intensity, and\n                    G. soricina\n                    did not produce feeding buzzes when approaching insects. An acoustic model of detection distances shows that its low‐intensity calls fail to trigger the auditory neurons of eared moths, allowing\n                    G. soricina\n                    to overcome auditory prey defences.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Individuals achieved niche flexibility using a unique but generalist behavioural approach rather than employing two different specialist methods. Our findings provide a novel insight into the functional mechanisms of insect capture in\n                    G. soricina\n                    and highlight the importance of considering niche flexibility in classifying trophic links in ecological communities.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Small isolated populations are vulnerable to both stochastic events and the negative consequences of genetic drift. For threatened species, the genetic management of such populations has therefore become a crucial aspect of conservation. Flying foxes (\n              Pteropus\n              spp, Chiroptera) are keystone species with essential roles in pollination and seed dispersal in tropical and subtropical ecosystems. Yet many flying fox species are also threatened, having experienced dramatic population declines driven by habitat loss and hunting. The insular Ryukyu flying fox (\n              Pteropus dasymallus\n              ) ranges from the Ryukyu Archipelago of Japan through Taiwan to the northern Philippines and has undergone precipitous population crashes on several islands in recent decades. To assess the population genetic structure and diversity in\n              P. dasymallus\n              , and its likely causes, we analyzed mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA. Both markers showed significant genetic differentiation among most island populations, with mitochondrial haplotypes showing some mixing across the regions, likely reflecting historical colonization and/or dispersal events. In contrast, microsatellite markers showed an overall pattern of isolation by distance; however, this pattern appeared to be driven by the presence of deep ocean trenches between geographically distant populations. Thus, the current distribution of\n              P. dasymallus\n              and its subspecific diversity appear to have arisen through vicariance coupled with a long history of restricted gene flow across oceanic barriers. We conclude that isolated island subgroups should be managed separately, with efforts directed at reducing further declines in genetic diversity.",

Nipah virus is a zoonotic emerging infectious disease for which pteropodid bats have been identified as a natural reservoir. In Cambodia, Nipah virus circulation has been reported in\n                    Pteropus lylei\n                    , but little is known about the spatial distribution of the species and the associated implications for conservation and public health.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We deployed Global Positioning System (GPS) collars on 14\n                    P. lylei\n                    to study their movements and foraging behavior in Cambodia in 2016. All of the flying foxes were captured from the same roost, and GPS locations were collected for 1 month. The habitats used by each bat were characterized through ground‐truthing, and a spatial distribution model was developed of foraging sites.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  A total of 13,643 valid locations were collected during the study. Our study bats flew approximately 20 km from the roost each night to forage. The maximum distance traveled per night ranged from 6.88–105 km and averaged 28.3 km. Six of the 14 bats visited another roost for at least one night during the study, including one roost located 105 km away.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Most foraging locations were in residential areas (53.7%) followed by plantations (26.6%). Our spatial distribution model confirmed that residential areas were the preferred foraging habitat for\n                    P. lylei\n                    , although our results should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of individuals studied.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    : Our findings suggest that the use of residential and agricultural habitats by\n                    P. lylei\n                    may create opportunities for bats to interact with humans and livestock. They also suggest the importance of anthropogenic habitats for conservation of this vulnerable and ecologically important group in Cambodia. Our mapping of the probability of occurrence of foraging sites will help identification of areas where public awareness should be promoted regarding the ecosystem services provided by flying foxes and potential for disease transmission through indirect contact.",

Horseshoe bats are characterized by echolocation calls dominated by a constant frequency component that is partly determined by maternal imprinting. Although previous studies showed that constant frequency calls are also influenced by some non-genetic factors, it is not known how frequency relates to genetic structure. To test this, we related constant frequency variation to genetic and non-genetic variables in the Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (\n              Rhinolophus monoceros\n              ). Recordings of bats from across Taiwan revealed that females called at higher frequencies than males; however, we found no effect of environmental or morphological factors on call frequency. By comparison, variation showed clear population structure, with frequencies lower in the centre and east, and higher in the north and south. Within these regions, frequency divergence was directional and correlated with geographical distance, suggesting that call frequencies are subject to cultural drift. However, microsatellite clustering analysis showed that broad differences in constant frequency among populations corresponded to discontinuities in allele frequencies resulting from vicariant events. Our results provide evidence that the processes shaping genetic subdivision have concomitant consequences for divergence in echolocation call frequency.",

            "abstractNote": "Intraspecific phylogenies can provide useful insights into how populations have been shaped by historical and contemporary processes. Taiwan formed around 5 million years ago from tectonic uplift, and has been connected to mainland Asia several times since its emergence. A central mountain range runs north to south, bisecting the island, and potentially impedes gene flow along an east–west axis. The Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros) is endemic to Taiwan, where it is found mainly at low altitude. To determine the population structure and the demographic and colonization history of this species, we examined variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region in 203 bats sampled at 26 sites. We found very high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, which decreased from the centre to the south and north. Population differentiation followed a pattern of isolation by distance, though most regional genetic variance was attributable to differences between the relatively isolated southern population and those from other regions. A haplotype network was consistent with these findings and also suggested a southward colonization, followed by subsequent secondary contact between the south and other regions. Mismatch distributions were used to infer a past population expansion predating the last glacial maximum, and a neighbour-joining tree showed that R. monoceros formed a monophyletic grouping with respect to its sister taxa. Taken together, our results suggest that this taxon arose from a single period of colonization, and that demographic growth followed in the late Pleistocene. Current genetic structure reflects limited gene flow, probably coupled with stepwise colonization in the past. We consider explanations for the persistence of the species through multiple glacial maxima.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Insectivorous bats are particularly susceptible to heat loss due to their relatively large surface area to volume ratio. Therefore, to maintain a high normothermic body temperature, bats require large amounts of energy for thermoregulation. This can be energetically challenging for small bats during cold periods as heat loss is augmented and insect prey is reduced. To conserve energy many bats enter a state of torpor characterized by a controlled reduction of metabolism and body temperature in combination with selecting roosts based upon thermal properties. Our study aimed to quantify torpor patterns and roost preferences of free-ranging little forest bats (Vespadelus vulturnus) during winter to identify physiological and behavioral mechanisms used by this species for survival of the cold season. All bats captured were male (body mass 4.9 ± 0.7 g, n = 6) and used torpor on every day monitored, with bouts lasting up to 187.58 h (mean = 35.5 ± 36.7 h, n = 6, total number of samples [N] = 61). Torpor bout duration was significantly correlated with daily minimum and maximum ambient temperature, mean skin temperature, insect mass, and body mass of individuals and the multiday torpor bouts recorded in the cold qualify as hibernation. The lowest skin temperature recorded was 5.2°C, which corresponded to the lowest ambient temperature measurement of −5.8°C. Most bats chose tall, large, live Eucalyptus trees for roosting and to leave their roost for foraging on warmer days. Many individuals often switched roosts (every 3–5 days) and movements increased as spring approached (every 1–2 days). Our data suggest that V. vulturnus are capable of using the environmental temperature to gauge potential foraging opportunities and as a cue to reenter torpor when conditions are unsuitable. Importantly, frequent use of torpor and appropriate roost selection form key roles in the winter survival of these tiny bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats can be phylogenetically classified into three major groups: pteropodids, rhinolophoids, and yangochiropterans. While rhinolophoids and yangochiropterans are capable of laryngeal echolocation, pteropodids lack this ability. Delicate ear movements are essential for echolocation behavior in bats with laryngeal echolocation. Caudal auricular muscles, especially the cervicoauricularis group, play a critical role in such ear movements. Previously, caudal auricular muscles were studied in three species of bats with laryngeal echolocation, but to our knowledge, there have been no studies on non-laryngeal echolocators, the pteropodids. Here, we describe the gross anatomy of the cervicoauricularis muscles and their innervation in Cynopterus sphinx by using diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography and 3D reconstructions of immunohistochemically stained serial sections. A previous study on bats with laryngeal echolocation reported that rhinolophoids have four cervicoauricularis muscles and yangochiropterans have three. We observed three cervicoauricularis muscles in the pteropodid C. sphinx. The number of cervicoauricularis muscles and their innervation pattern were comparable to those of non-bat boreoeutherian mammals and yangochiropterans, suggesting that pteropodids, and yangochiropterans maintain the general condition of boreoeutherian mammals and that rhinolophoids have a derived condition. The unique nomenclature had been previously applied to the cervicoauricularis muscles of bats with laryngeal echolocation, but given the commonality between non-bat laurasiatherians and bats, with the exception of rhinolophoids, maintaining the conventional nomenclature (i.e., M. cervicoauricularis superficialis, M. cervicoauricularis medius, and M. cervicoauricularis profundus) is proposed for bats.",

To investigate the molecular link between circadian and hibernating rhythms in the greater tube-nosed bats, Murina leucogaster, we set out to identify circadian genes that are expressed in bats, with specific focus on the PAS domain by using PCR-based screens. We could isolate a cDNA clone, designated as LPAS1, that encodes a protein of 521 amino acid residues. LPAS1 is closely related with CLOCK family with the highest homology to human CLOCK. Based on RT-PCR analyses, LPAS1 transcripts are ubiquitously present in tissues from both summer active and winter dormant periods. Given that LPAS1 is a member of the bHLH-PAS protein superfamily but lacks polyglutamine transactivation domains, it is likely to function as a repressor for endogenous CLOCK to hinder its roles in promoting transcription. Our result will open a new avenue to further examine the functional interconnection between the circadian clock and the circannual clock such as mammalian hibernation.",

In particular, we describe steps which enable laboratories that do not have access to live bats to perform extended experimental work upon procuring an initial batch of bat primary airway tissue. Complete mucociliary diﬀerentiation required treatment with IL-13. E. spelaea ALI-AECs supported productive infection with PRV3M, an orthoreovirus for which Pteropodid bats are considered the reservoir species. However, these ALI-AECs did not support SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite E. spelaea ACE2 receptor being capable of mediating SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus entry.

In this study, we investigated the nuclear and mitochondrial genetic differentiation of the long fingered bat,\n              Myotis capaccinii\n              during the ice ages in south‐eastern Europe and Anatolia. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses indicated a suture zone similar to those recorded in other animal species, including bats, suggesting the association of more than one refugium with the region. Contrary to most of the other species where a suture zone was seen in Anatolia, for\n              M. capaccinii\n              the geographical location of the genetic break was in south‐eastern Europe. This mitochondrial differentiation was not reflected in the nuclear microsatellites, however, suggesting that the lack of contact during the ice ages did not result in reproductive isolation. Hence taxonomically, the two mitochondrial clades cannot be treated as separate species.",

            "abstractNote": "The hindlimbs allow bats to attach to the mother from birth, and roost during independent life. Despite the great morphological diversity in Chiroptera, the hindlimbs morphology and its postnatal development have been poorly studied. Postnatal development of hindlimbs in Noctilio leporinus is described, further comparing the morphology of adults with that of Noctilio albiventris and previously reported species (Desmodus rotundus, Artibeus lituratus, Molossus molossus). The ossification ending sequence at autopodium elements of N. leporinus does not follow the distal to proximal directional sequence described for D. rotundus, exhibiting a heterochronic delayed ossification ending for the digits of N. leporinus regarding other hindlimb elements, associated with the bigger relative autopodium size of this fisher bat regarding other bat species. Noctilionid bats share the same adult hindlimb bone morphology, except for differences at hindlimb proportions and calcar ossification degree. There are differences in the number and position of bony processes, slots and sesamoids of adult noctilionid fisher bats regarding previously reported species; most differences are concentrated at the autopodium and are related to an increased surface for muscular insertion and the structural support of claws. These facts seem to be closely associated with functional demands of the feeding strategy of noctilionid fisher bats.",

Cystidicola cristivomeri White, 1941 is considered a synonym of C. stigmatura. Cystidicola stigmatura is distinguished from the only other species in the genus, namely C. farionis Fischer, 1798, by the presence of lateral lobes on the eggs rather than filaments. A neotype of F. stigmatura is designated. Cystidicola stigmatura has not been found in fishes in the Great Lakes since 1925. The parasite was found in museum specimens of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) collected before 1925, suggesting that the species became rare or disappeared with the decline of lake trout in these lakes.",

Urgent action is required to document the status of biodiversity to facilitate efficacious conservation plans. Within country, new generations of Malagasy scientists and conservationists are taking on leadership roles, although many lack access to modern genetic sequencing and are underrepresented in academic publications, when compared to international counterparts.\n          \n            With the recent advent of portable and affordable genetic technologies, it is now possible to tackle logistical considerations. Mobile genetics labs, with the capacity for\n            in situ\n            DNA extraction, amplification and sequencing, can produce scientifically reproducible data under field conditions, minimizing the time between sample collection and data analysis. Additionally, mobile labs offer powerful training opportunities for in-country scientists that enable local students and researchers to actively participate and contribute fully to the research enterprise, and that further empower these communities to contribute to the conservation dialog.\n          \n          \n            Here, we show “proof of concept” by deploying a miniaturized thermal cycler alongside the Oxford Nanopore MinION DNA sequencer in Madagascar, including in the newly established Anjajavy Protected Area in northwestern Madagascar. We successfully extracted DNA from tissue samples collected using minimally-invasive techniques, amplified and sequenced a phylogenetically informative mitochondrial gene (cytochrome-b;\n            cytb\n            ), and thereby confirmed the presence of Danfoss’ mouse lemur (\n            M. danfossi\n            ) within the Anjajavy Reserve.\n          \n          \n            To demonstrate the reproducibility of our methods, we successfully performed our established molecular and analytical pipeline at two additional locations in Madagascar, where we also conducted two-day workshops at local higher-education Institutions to demonstrate the process from tissue samples to DNA sequencing. Ultimately, we show that a mobile genetics lab can provide reliable and expeditious results, become a powerful educational tool, and allow scientists to conduct genetic analyses, potentially allowing for rapid interventions under emergency conditions\n            in situ\n            .",

Illegal trade in live European eel and its products is still occurring to satisfy the high demand around the world. Law enforcement officers face the challenge of identifying both live and processed European eel in a timely fashion to detain shipments and prosecute smugglers. Here, we describe the development of a reliable, field‐based, fast, and cost‐effective real‐time polymerase chain reaction assay to detect European eels in trade. This novel assay was applied in a real law enforcement scenario, where positive results provided enough evidence to detain the shipment for more robust forensic analysis, leading to the first prosecution of eel smuggling in Hong Kong. Our approach could serve as a model for the development of other rapid and cost‐effective tools to detect illegal wildlife trade where visual identification fails to provide enough evidence for prosecution. It could also enhance monitoring and enforcement of laws intended to protect highly traded and threatened species.",

The newly recognized species is characterized by the presence of a subterminal hexagonal oral opening with 24 triangular and prominent denticles of the same shape and size and a buccal capsule with 3 oesophageal teeth with jagged edges. The male has a robust body covered with 40 to 43 pairs of subventral cuticular spines, a coiled tail with thin caudal alae, 10 pairs of papillae, and a single, precloacal, semicircular cuticular fan on the ventral surface. The first pair of precloacal papillae are composed of 2 short pedunculated papillae, a feature that seems to be unique to P. (P.) andyraicola when compared to other species of the subgenus Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines). Equal spicules and the cone-shaped gubernaculum poorly sclerotized. The female has a robust body, thinner in the anterior portion, covered by 2 rows of 67 to 80 cuticular spines, of which the first 41 to 43 pairs are anterior to the vulvar opening and symmetrically arranged, which is in contrast to the asymmetrical disposition of the postvulvar spines. This is the 15th species in the genus described from mammals in the Neotropical ecozone and the third parasitizing bats in this biogeographic region.",

Morphological trait variation within species inﬂuences the energetic cost of locomotion and impacts life history traits, with ecological and evolutionary consequences. This study examined wing morphology correlates of ﬂight performance measured by energetic expenditure in the Seba’s short-tailed bat, Carollia perspicillata. In the ﬂight experiments, nature caught bats (59 females, 57 males) were allowed to ﬂy for 3 min in a room. After each ﬂight, thermographic images were taken to measure body temperature, and biophysical models were used to calculate sensible heat loss as a measure of energetic expenditure. Wing morphological traits were measured for each individual and associated with heat loss and power required to ﬂy on performance surfaces. Wing morphological traits explained 7–10% of ﬂight energetic cost, and morphologies with the best performance would save the energy equivalent to 9–30% of total daily requirements. The optimal performance areas within the C. perspicillata morphospace were consistent with predicted selection trends from the literature. A trade-off between demands for ﬂight speed and maneuverability was observed. Wing loading and camber presented sexual dimorphism. These morphological differences are likely associated with more economical but less maneuverable ﬂight in females, leading them to ﬂy more often in open areas along the forest edge. Our ﬁndings demonstrate how small scale changes in wing morphology can affect life history strategies and ﬁtness.",

It has not been documented in the southeast US on bats captured outside caves or on the landscape in summer. We collected 136 skin swabs from 10 species of bats captured at 20 sites on the Tennessee side of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, 12 May–16 August 2015. Three swabs were found positive for P. destructans, one from a male tricolored bat (Perimyotis subflavus) and two from male big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus). This detection of P. destructans on freeflying male bats in the southeast US during summer has potential repercussions for the spread of the fungus to novel bat species and environments. Our finding emphasizes the need to maintain rigorous year-round decontamination of field clothing and equipment until more is understood about the viability of P. destructans found on bats captured outside hibernacula during summer, about the potential for males to act as reservoirs of the fungus, and the risk of fungal transmission and spread.",

As the process of spermatogenesis is under hormonal control, mainly of pituitary and androgen hormones, our aim was to analyze the morphological variations and the hormonal control of the testes of E. furinalis during the four phases of its reproductive cycle. Testes of 18 adult males, divided into four sample groups (active, regressing, regressed, and recrudescence phases), were submitted to morphological, morphometric, and immunohistochemical analyzes. The results demonstrate that the processes of testicular regression and recrudescence of E. furinalis are under the control of pituitary, androgen and estrogen hormones. The regulation is exerted mainly through the activation and cross signaling of AR and FSHR in Sertoli cells and of LHR in Leydig cells. The testicular regression appears to be activated by an inhibition/reduction of AR expression in Sertoli cells, which inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of new spermatogonia and causes the deactivation of spermatogenesis. Conversely, the testicular recrudescence occurs by the increasing of the expression of LHR in Leydig cells, and AR and FSHR in Sertoli cells, which reactivates the testicular production of androgens and estrogens, the proliferation of spermatogonia and restarts the spermatogenesis.",

Between June 25 and July 4, 2022, we conducted emergence and juvenile counts, took light intensity measurements during emergence times and evaluated microclimatic conditions inside the roost, namely temperature and relative humidity. Moreover, we took ultrasound recordings in the open and performed transects to locate foraging areas and commuting corridors. We found the colony amounted to at least 501 individuals (371 adults and 130 juveniles), currently the largest known in Portugal and one of the biggest in Europe. Sixteen matching echolocation calls were recorded away from the colony near a water reservoir, a probable foraging area together with the Vale da Telha valley connecting the roost to the water body, which may also serve as a commuting corridor. Considering the threatened conservation status of the lesser horseshoe bat, the large colony size and its lack of protection, we proposed several conservation measures aimed at preserving the colony. We hope our recommendations will be included in the management plan currently being prepared for the Natura 2000 site Costa Sudoeste. Following up on this research, a radio-tracking study would definitively confirm the bats’ movements and foraging grounds.",

Here, I review the social structure and mating systems of 4 nominal species in the Old World fruit bat genus Cynopterus, and explore the relationship between roosting ecology, the size and stability of female groups, and variation in degree of polygyny. Intraspeciﬁc comparisons for C. brachyotis Sunda and C. sphinx suggest that the distribution and availability of suitable roost sites has a strong inﬂuence on the dispersion of females among males. Examination of paternity data for C. sphinx demonstrates a direct relationship between the environmental potential for polygyny and variance in male reproductive success: a 2-fold increase in mean harem size due to reduction in roost availability produces a 2-fold increase in reproductive skew among males. However, in C. brachyotis Sunda, C. sphinx, and C. horsﬁeldii, low ﬁdelity of females to roosts or males is consistent, regardless of roost dispersion or permanence. In contrast, female C. brachyotis Forest exhibit high short-term ﬁdelity to males, despite low roost ﬁdelity. It is proposed that female lability is inﬂuenced by the distribution of potential mates and the beneﬁts of multiple mating and, in C. brachyotis Sunda and C. sphinx, is likely to promote both behavioral and cryptic female choice, and male sperm competition.",

During the Pleistocene glacial cycles and associated sea level fluctuations, the Sunda region in Southeast Asia experienced concurrent changes in landmass area and the ratio of forest to open habitat, providing an ideal setting to test the expectation that habitat associations played an important role in determining species’ response to the opportunity for geographic expansion. We used mitochondrial control region sequences and six microsatellite loci to compare the phylogeographic structure and demographic histories of four broadly sympatric species of Old World fruit bats in the genus, Cynopterus. Two forest-associated species and two open-habitat generalists were sampled along a latitudinal transect in Singapore, peninsular Malaysia, and southern Thailand. Contrary to expectations based on habitat associations, the geographic scale of population structure was not concordant across ecologically similar species. We found evidence for long and relatively stable demographic history in one forest and one open-habitat species, and inferred non-coincident demographic expansions in the second forest and open-habitat species. Thus, while these results indicate that Pleistocene climate change did not have a single effect on population structure across species, a correlation between habitat association and response to environmental change was supported in only two of four species. We conclude that interactions between multiple factors, including historical and contemporary environmental change, species-specific ecology and interspecific interactions, have shaped the recent evolutionary histories of Cynopterus fruit bats in Southeast Asia.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging infectious disease of hibernating bats linked to the death of an estimated 5.7 million or more bats in the northeastern United States and Canada. White-nose syndrome is caused by the cold-loving fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), which invades the skin of the muzzles, ears, and wings of hibernating bats. Previous work has shown that WNS-affected bats arouse to euthermic or near euthermic temperatures during hibernation significantly more frequently than normal and that these too-frequent arousals are tied to severity of infection and death date. We quantified the behavior of bats during these arousal bouts to understand better the causes and consequences of these arousals. We hypothesized that WNS-affected bats would display increased levels of activity (especially grooming) during their arousal bouts from hibernation compared to WNS-unaffected bats. Behavior of both affected and unaffected hibernating bats in captivity was monitored from December 2010 to March 2011 using temperature-sensitive dataloggers attached to the backs of bats and infrared motion-sensitive cameras. The WNS-affected bats exhibited significantly higher rates of grooming, relative to unaffected bats, at the expense of time that would otherwise be spent inactive. Increased self-grooming may be related to the presence of the fungus. Elevated activity levels in affected bats likely increase energetic stress, whereas the loss of rest (inactive periods when aroused from torpor) may jeopardize the ability of a bat to reestablish homeostasis in a number of physiologic systems.",

            "abstractNote": "Information about the population genetic structures of parasites is important for an understanding of parasite transmission pathways and ultimately the co-evolution with their hosts. If parasites cannot disperse independently of their hosts, a parasite’s population structure will depend upon the host’s spatial distribution. Geographical barriers affecting host dispersal can therefore lead to structured parasite populations. However, how the host’s social system affects the genetic structure of parasite populations is largely unknown. We used mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to describe the spatio-temporal population structure of a contact-transmitted parasitic wing mite (Spinturnix bechsteini) and compared it to that of its social host, the Bechstein’s bat (Myotis bechsteinii). We observed no genetic differentiation between mites living on different bats within a colony. This suggests that mites can move freely among bats of the same colony. As expected in case of restricted inter-colony dispersal, we observed a strong genetic differentiation of mites among demographically isolated bat colonies. In contrast, we found a strong genetic turnover between years when we investigated the temporal variation of mite haplotypes within colonies. This can be explained with mite dispersal occuring between colonies and bottlenecks of mite populations within colonies. The observed absence of isolation by distance could be the result from genetic drift and ⁄ or from mites dispersing even between remote bat colonies, whose members may meet at mating sites in autumn or in hibernacula in winter. Our data show that the population structure of this parasitic wing mite is influenced by its own demography and the peculiar social system of its bat host.",

Here, we present evidence of male gamete-mediated gene ﬂow resulting from extra-group mating in Spix’s disc-winged bat, Thyroptera tricolor, a species which demonstrates all-offspring philopatry. We used microsatellite and capture–recapture data to characterize social group structure and the distribution of mated pairs at two sites in southwestern Costa Rica over four breeding seasons. Relatedness and genetic spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated strong kinship within groups and over short distances (<50 m), resulting from matrilineal group structure and small roosting home ranges (~0.2 ha). Despite high relatedness among-group members, observed inbreeding coefﬁcients were low (FIS = 0.010 and 0.037). Parentage analysis indicated mothers and offspring belonged to the same social group, while fathers belonged to different groups, separated by large distances (~500 m) when compared to roosting home ranges. Simulated random mating indicated mate choice was not based on intermediate levels of relatedness, and mated pairs were less related than adults within social groups on average. Isolation-by-distance (IBD) models of genetic neighbourhood area based on father–offspring distances provided direct estimates of mean gamete dispersal distances (^r) > 10 roosting home range equivalents. Indirect estimates based on genetic distance provided even larger estimates of ^r, indicating direct estimates were biased low. These results suggest extra-group mating reduces the incidence of inbreeding in T. tricolor, and male gamete dispersal facilitates gene ﬂow in lieu of natal dispersal of young.",

Our aim was to compare the general ovary morphology and the folliculogenesis process in these species to increase the knowledge about the reproductive diversity of tropical bats. We observed a morphological distinction between the ovaries of both species: A. planirostris presents the primordial follicles located in a cranial portion of the ovary and the interstitial gland cells are not distinctive, while in E. furinalis, the primordial follicles are located throughout the cortex, and there is an abundance of interstitial gland cells. Both species present binovular or triovular follicles. Artibeus planirostris is a monovular species, with a preferential ovulation in the left side. Some females of E. furinalis exhibited two corpora lutea in the same ovary, and others presented a corpus luteum in both right and left ovaries at the same time; thus, E. furinalis is a polyovular species. Our results express the variation between two Neotropical species, reflecting the great variation in the reproductive aspects in Chiroptera.",

We acoustically monitored for bat species that produce low freque echolocation calls (<30 kHz minimum frequency), specifically Hoary Bat ( Lasiurus cinere Silver-haired Bat, and Big Brown Bat ( Eptesicus fuscus) at 40 sites in 16 locations across South Alaska from 2011 to 2013 using passive bat detectors. The Hoary Bat was not previously kno from Alaska, but we recorded 25 call files of this species (of 26,151 low frequency bat files) sites in northern Southeast Alaska (4 mainland sites and 1 site on Chichagof Island); an addit 110 call files were classified as probable Hoary Bat, but were ambiguous. We recorded 307 files that contained echolocation calls diagnostic of Silver-haired Bats; no files had character diagnostic of Big Brown Bats. The rest of the low frequency recordings were identified probable Silver-haired Bat calls, although Big Brown Bats cannot be ruled out due to extensive overlap of acoustic characteristics between these 2 species. We recorded Hoary almost exclusively during the autumn migration period. By contrast, Silver-haired Bats w detected throughout the summer active season, indicating at least some individuals are resid in Southeast Alaska. Silver-haired Bat activity was greatest at sites on or near the mainland, w most sites showing peaks of activity in spring, suggesting bats from the interior ma overwintering in the region. Winter recordings suggest Silver-haired Bats (and Big Brown Ba present) are active to some extent during winter in Southeast Alaska. Understanding distribution and seasonality of Hoary and Silver-haired Bat activity in Southeast Alaska critical 1st step toward identifying their habitat requirements and conservation needs in region.",

The Silver-haired Bat suffered few external injuries, the most conspicuous of which were a missing lower right canine and small puncture wounds on the left wing membrane. The Hoary Bat experienced much more extensive external injuries, including sub-dermal bleeding on wing and tail membranes and bite marks and tears in both wings. Few published accounts describe physical altercations among bats, but Hoary Bats are frequently involved. Rabies is often implicated as a driving factor in the aggressive interactions. We decided not to euthanize the bat for rabies testing, but encourage others who encounter these types of interactions to have bats tested.",

            "abstractNote": "The small population and limited range of the Samoan ¯ying fox Pteropus samoensis has generated concern regarding the survival of this large, diurnally active bat. During 1995±96, surveys were conducted monthly in six study valleys on Tutuila Island, American Samoa, to assess population size. The amount of diurnal and nocturnal activity was investigated to gauge the accuracy of diurnal surveys, and territorial behaviours were observed to determine how they in¯uenced local dispersion. Individuals showed long-term ®delity to a series of roosts and small core areas that were used both nocturnally and diurnally. Territorial defence was observed only of temporary feeding territories in fruiting or ¯owering trees. Bats defended food resources by aerial patrols and extended aerial chases in which intruders were frequently bitten. Foraging movements changed seasonally, with up to 80% of individuals observed bypassing study valleys. The mean density of bats observed within the study valleys was 6.1 bats/km2 (range = 0.9±18.5 bats/km2). Pteropus samoensis were active both nocturnally and diurnally with greatest activity in late afternoon and evening, 16:00±22:00. Because bats were most active at night, it is probable that daytime surveys of ¯ying bats undercount the number of individuals present. Greatest densities were found in valleys that were contiguous with large tracts of forest inaccessible to people. Most observations of roosting bats were of solitary males on dead branches that jutted above the forest canopy, while females and dependant young roosted below the canopy, hidden within vegetation. Adult male±female pairs were rarely seen together other than during the mating period in August±January. The population has increased following a ban on hunting, but reliance on mature forest makes long-term species survival dependant on protection of the limited mature forest remaining and continued hunting restrictions.",

However, Ozark big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii ingens) are highly susceptible to human disturbance. The purpose of this study was to performing a molecular dietary analysis of Ozark big-eared bats. Our study detected 40 species representing two orders (Diptera and Lepidoptera) and 11 families of insects and thus, providing new information regarding dietary habits of Ozark big-eared bats.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate phylogenetic relationships within Pteronotus using DNA sequence data from the mitochondrial ribosomal and cytochrome b genes and the nuclear Recombination Activating Gene-2 based on likelihood inferential techniques (maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetics). Results of this study present, for the first time, a fully resolved and strongly supported phylogeny for all relationships within Pteronotus. These data strongly support: sister-group relationships between davyi and gymnonotus (subgenus pteronotus), between macleayii and quadridens (subgenus chilonycteris), and between the subgenera pteronotus and chilonycteris. Pteronotus personatus is sister to this clade and P. parnellii is the most basal lineage of Pteronotus. Although this is the first study to provide a fullyresolved and strongly supported hypothesis for the phylogenetic relationships among species of Pteronotus, future work must focus on phylogeographic surveys within each species because previous studies have suggested that parnellii and personatus may contain undescribed species.",

Initial analysis showed that in addition to the echolocation calls at 81–84 kHz there were ultrasound calls at lower frequencies. Simultaneous recordings of ultrasound and low frequency signals (1–10 kHz) showed that echolocation pulses, ultrasound social calls and low frequency social calls were quite distinct in both duration, frequency and number of calls. Twelve types of ultrasound social calls were identified. The majority of calls were in the range 20–29 kHz and 1–49 ms duration. Variability was found in the relative power of the fundamental and harmonics of the calls. This analysis has identified a substantial repertoire of calls used by R. ferrumequinum in a nursery roost colony. The possibility of the use of a male advertisement call in the roost is discussed.",

There is a need for immortalized bat cell lines to culture and investigate the pathogenicity, replication kinetics, and evolution of emerging coronaviruses. We illustrate the susceptibility and permissiveness of a spontaneously immortalized kidney cell line (Rhileki) from Blyth’s horseshoe bat (R. lepidus) to SARS-CoV-2 virus, including clinical isolates, suggesting a possible virus-host relationship. We were able to observe limited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Rhileki cells compared with simian VeroE6 cells. Slower viral replication in Rhileki cells was indicated by higher ct values (RT-PCR) at later time points of the viral culture and smaller foci (foci forming assay) compared with those of VeroE6 cells. With this study we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 replication is not restricted to R. sinicus and could include more Rhinolophus species. The establishment of a continuous Rhinolophus lepidus kidney cell line allows further characterization of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Rhinolophus bat cells, as well as isolation attempts of other bat-borne viruses.",

A colony of 100–130 individuals, each one with the distinctive external and morphological charac­ teristics of the species, was found roosting in the lower parts of the floor of bungalows located in the Sarapiquí area. The rediscovery of this species validates the protec­ tion of several rainforest fragments through ecotourism, a modern way to balance human development and bio­ diversity conservation.",

Five of the\n              Histoplasma\n              isolates from the bats were subsequently identified as Latin American (LA) clade A, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) class 6. These observations raised concern as to whether the commercially available HAg test could detect\n              Histoplasma\n              antigen not of the North American clade upon which the HAg test had been developed. To evaluate this concern, a murine model of disseminated histoplasmosis was established, and mice were infected with multiple LA\n              Histoplasma\n              isolates, including clinical isolates recovered from Brazilian AIDS patients (RFLP class 5 and class 6) and isolates recovered from the bats during the outbreak (RFLP class 6).\n              Histoplasma\n              antigen was detected in all infected mice in our experiments, even when\n              Histoplasma\n              was not recovered in culture. Because the currently available HAg test is able to detect\n              Histoplasma\n              antigen in mice infected with Latin American isolates, this suggests that bat host factors rather than differences among\n              Histoplasma\n              RFLP classes were responsible for the inability to detect HAg in infected bats.",

Conspecifics may also get attracted towards distress calls as a behaviour of cooperative mobbing or just selfishly assessing the potential source of danger. The exact functions of distress calls in bats therefore vary to a great degree and are very hard to pinpoint. We conducted playback experiments to test the response of short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx towards the distress calls of their conspecifics from related and unrelated sites. Bats were attracted to their conspecifics from both related and unrelated sites and in one occasion towards fruit bat (Rousettus leschenaulti) of another genus within the same family. The response towards the opposite sex was significant in most of the playback trials and the reasons remain unclear. This symmetric response towards conspecifics from related and unrelated sites suggests the possibility of fruit bats building social relationships among unrelated individuals and probably between species.",

The genus consists of 7 species, 4 broadly distributed through the Caribbean and mainland of North and South America, and 3 species limited to the Greater Antilles archipelago. We present a brief review of the taxonomic history, redefine the genus, and consider some questions that remain concerning the biology and systematics of the group. A new species, Cameronieta almaensis n. sp., is described from the wings of Pteronotus parnellii collected from the Serra das Almas Reserve, in the northeastern state of Ceará, Brazil. This is the first record of Cameronieta from Brazil.",

Although many studies have reported die-offs of bats at winter hibernacula, it is important to understand how bat mortality linked to WNS at winter hibernacula affects bat activity levels in their summer ranges. In the summer (May–August) of 2007, 2008 and 2009, we recorded echolocation calls to determine bat activity at sites along the Hudson River, NY (within approx. 100 km of where WNS was first reported). We documented a 78 per cent decline in the summer activity of\n              M. lucifugus\n              , coinciding with the arrival and spread of WNS. We suggest that mortality of\n              M. lucifugus\n              in winter hibernacula is reflected by reduced levels of activity in the summer and that WNS affects the entire bat population of an area, and not only individual hibernacula.",

Here, we report on the predation of a protected species of pipistrelle bat by S. nobilis in Britain. To our knowledge, this is the first recorded case of a Theridiidae spider preying on a bat globally, the first case of a Theridiidae spider preying on a vertebrate in Britain, and the first global case of a Steatoda preying on a mammal.",

The inflorescence of\n              Ficus\n              , hereafter referred to as the ‘fig’, is an enclosed receptacle lined with unisexual flowers. The flowers of\n              Ficus\n              species are pollinated by wasps that feed on galled fig ovules as larvae and that lay eggs in fig flowers as adults (Weiblen 2002). Ripe figs are consumed by vertebrate frugivores, which are the primary dispersers of fig seeds (Shanahan\n              et al.\n              2001). The interaction between figs, pollinators and frugivores introduces the potential for conflict between the roles of raising fig wasps and dispersing seeds. Specifically, the pollination mutualism could be compromised if frugivores consumed figs containing pollinator larvae. This conflict is resolved in very different ways according to the breeding system of the fig.",

One pair of middle-sized acrocentric autosomes is provided with satellites, and among small elements only one pair is punctiform. The X chromosome is a large submetacentric one: its average centromere index is 2,89. The Y chromosome is small and oblong. A comparison has been made between the karyogram of Rhinolophus mehelyi and those of Rh. ferrumequinum, Rh. euryale, Rh. blasii and Rh. hipposideros. The results speak in favour of the opinion of CAPANNA and CIVITELLI (1964), and CAPANNA, CIVITELLI and CoNTI (1967) on the significance of the morphologically identical chromosomes: their role in the phylogeny of Rhinolophid bats was discussed.",

None of the examined species were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium following the global test for heterozygote deficiency. Inbreeding coefficient (FIS) values at the species level also were statistically greater than zero. This may indicate some level of inbreeding in all examined taxa although it seems to be relatively low because significant FIS values were recorded in only 2 swarming sites of M. mystacinus, 2 sites of M. brandtii, and 3 sites of M. alcathoe. However, almost 10% of related individuals sharing 1 parent (i.e., half siblings) were found in the same swarming sites for M. mystacinus and M. brandtii, with fewer observed in M. alcathoe. At the population level, 4.1%, 5.9%, and 8.7% of individuals of M. mystacinus, M. brandtii, and M. alcathoe, respectively, were assigned as full siblings. These figures suggest the possibility of females mating selectively with the same male in more than 1 year.",

            "abstractNote": "The serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus is the most frequently rabies-infected (European bat lyssavirus 1-type, EBLV-1) bat species in Europe. To confirm Lyssavirus infection of this bat in Poland, we tested for the presence of rabies virus RNA from oropharyngeal swabs using RT-PCR. There was a 0.9% (two out of 212 individuals) level of infection within the overall population of serotine bats studied. However, an appreciation of the potential for pathogen transmission and disease risk requires an understanding of the dispersal of the primary host, and any large-scale geographic barriers that may impede gene flow. Thus, we also studied the patterns of bat dispersal via population genetics using nuclear (seven microsatellite loci) and mitochondrial (mtDNA control region) markers, examined in 12 subpopulations distributed across the country. Molecular analyses of microsatellite loci indicated high genetic diversity at all sites (heterozygosity observed, HO = 0.53–0.78), and extremely weak genetic structure in the Polish population of the species. The overall FST was 0.012 (95% confidence interval: 0.006–0.020), and pairwise values ranged from 0.00 to 0.05. Only 22% of individuals were assigned to the subpopulation from which they were sampled. The Bayesian approach implemented in STRUCTURE also confirmed that all examined subpopulations should be treated as a single group, indicating a high level of gene flow. There was some evidence for female philopatry (genetic differentiation was greater in maternally-inherited mtDNA than nuclear DNA) and male-biased dispersal, e.g., HO and the variance of mean assignment were significantly higher in males than in females. Twelve individuals (seven females and five males) were identified as potential first generation migrants. Their migration routes ranged from 60–283 km in females (0 ± SE = 177.9 ± 29.37) to 27–385 km in males (206.4 ± 58.95); surprisingly, no sexual differences were observed and this finding suggests that female-mediated gene flow may occur. MtDNA also produced a strong genetic signal for the demographic expansion (Fu’s FS statistics, FS = -26.30, P < 0.01 and a star-shaped haplotype network), which took place roughly 33,000 years BP, i.e., before the Last Glacial Maximum. The genetic uniformity of the Polish population implies that there is no migration barrier to EBLV-1, at least within the country, and the potential threat of rabies virus spreading via migration of infected animals may be higher than previously thought.",

However, little is known about which bat species are associated with this behaviour. Here, I present the ﬁrst description of the use of two tents by Recife Broad-nosed Bat, Platyrrhinus reciﬁnus, constructed in leaves of Miconia brunnea in a degraded Brazilian Atlantic forest fragment. Both structures had the architectural style of tents-boat/apical. The shape of the leaves may mediate the architecture of these tents. In addition, they observed that only one male attended the two tents during the same night. This description provides new insights into the biology and behaviour of Platyrrhinus species. I further highlight several unknown for most tent-making bats that merit future research.",

Seven (12.3%) of 57 bats screened in this study showed yeasts in their faeces. Five species of the genus Candida were isolated: C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C. pelliculosa. No phospholipase activity was detected in the egg yolk plate assay; however, all isolates demonstrated protease secretion in skim milk agar. Yeasts isolated from bats produced bioﬁlm on the surface of polystyrene plates and all were classiﬁed as intermediate bioﬁlm producers. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for ﬂuconazole in the yeasts varied according to the species. Only one isolate (M34 – C. lusitaniae) was considered susceptible dose-dependent to ﬂuconazole. The yeasts were injected intravenously into Swiss mice, and at 15 days post-infection, the animals were killed and portions of their kidneys cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar medium. All tissues analysed showed positive cultures of Candida spp. This is the ﬁrst study evaluating the presence of fungi in the faeces of bats in an urban region, where the yeast species found were shown to be potentially pathogenic. As bats are commonly found in cities, these ﬁndings indicate the need for continuous surveillance concerning environmental contamination by their excreta.",

            "abstractNote": "A predator's capacity to catch prey depends on its ability to navigate its environment in response to prey movements or escape behaviour. In predator–prey interactions that involve an active chase, pursuit behaviour can be studied as the collection of rules that dictate how a predator should steer to capture prey. It remains unclear how variable this behaviour is within and across species since most studies have detailed the pursuit behaviour of high-speed, open-area foragers. In this study, we analyse the pursuit behaviour in 44 successful captures by\n              Corynorhinus townsendii\n              , Townsend's big-eared bat (\n              n\n              = 4). This species forages close to vegetation using slow and highly manoeuvrable flight, which contrasts with the locomotor capabilities and feeding ecologies of other taxa studied to date. Our results indicate that this species relies on an initial stealthy approach, which is generally sufficient to capture prey (32 out of 44 trials). In cases where the initial approach is not sufficient to perform a capture attempt (12 out of 44 trials),\n              C. townsendii\n              continues its pursuit by reacting to prey movements in a manner best modelled with a combination of pure pursuit, or following prey directly, and proportional navigation, or moving to an interception point.",

The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of methyl mercury (MeHg) has serious effects on wildlife, and is most evident in apex predators. The MeHg body burden in birds is the balance of ingestion and excretion, and MeHg in feathers is an effective indicator of overall MeHg burden. Ivory gulls (\n              Pagophila eburnea\n              ), which consume ice-associated prey and scavenge marine mammal carcasses, have the highest egg Hg concentrations of any Arctic bird, and the species has declined by more than 80% since the 1980s in Canada. We used feathers from museum specimens from the Canadian Arctic and western Greenland to assess whether exposure to MeHg by ivory gulls increased from 1877 to 2007. Based on constant feather stable-isotope (\n              δ\n              13\n              C,\n              δ\n              15\n              N) values, there was no significant change in ivory gulls' diet over this period, but feather MeHg concentrations increased 45× (from 0.09 to 4.11 µg g\n              −1\n              in adults). This dramatic change in the absence of a dietary shift is clear evidence of the impact of anthropogenic Hg on this high-latitude threatened species. Bioavailable Hg is expected to increase in the Arctic, raising concern for continued population declines in high-latitude species that are far from sources of environmental contaminants.",

Eleven populations from four countries (Benin, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Senegal) had comparable levels of genetic diversity, although the two populations in the extreme west (Senegal) had less diversity. Pairwise\n              F\n              ST\n              ranged from 0.02 to 0.28 and increased with geographic distance, even at a regional scale. Gene pools detected by Bayesian clustering seem to be a byproduct of the isolation‐by‐distance pattern rather than representing actual discrete entities. The organization of genetic diversity appears to result essentially from spatially restricted gene flow, with some influences of human seed exchange. Despite the potential for relatively long‐distance pollen and seed dispersal by bats within populations, statistically significant spatial genetic structuring within populations (SGS) was detected and gave a mean indirect estimate of neighborhood size of ca. 45. This study demonstrated that relatively high levels of genetic structuring are present in baobab at both large and within‐population level, which was unexpected in regard to its dispersal by bats and the influence of human exchange of seeds. Implications of these results for the conservation of baobab populations are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "The ovaries of early embryos (40 days post coitum/p.c.) of the bat Carollia perspicillata contain numerous germ-line cysts, which are composed of 10 to 12 sister germ cells (cystocytes). Variability in the number of cystocytes within the cyst and between the cysts (defying the Giardina rule) indicates that the mitotic divisions of the cystoblast are asynchronous in this bat species. Serial section analysis showed that the cystocytes are interconnected via intercellular bridges that are atypical, strongly elongated, short-lived, and rich in microtubule bundles and microﬁlaments. During slightly later stages of embryonic development (44–46 days p.c.), somatic cells penetrate the cyst, and their cytoplasmic projections separate individual oocytes. Separated oocytes surrounded by a single layer of somatic cells constitute the primordial ovarian follicles. The oocytes of C. perspicillata are similar to mouse oocytes and are asymmetric. In both species, this asymmetry is clearly recognizable in the localization of the Golgi complexes. The presence of germ-line cysts and intercellular bridges (although noncanonical) in the fetal ovaries of C. perspicillata suggest that the formation of germ-line cysts is an evolutionarily conserved phase in the development of the female gametes in a substantial part of the animal kingdom. genesis 50:18–27, 2012.
