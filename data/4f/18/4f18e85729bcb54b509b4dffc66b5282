            "abstractNote": "Many bat pups emit isolation calls with low-frequency components that facilitate maternal recognition. Most previous studies have noted that isolation calls generally have unique individual identity, but few studies have attempted to assess the potential impact of genetic factors on individual characteristics of isolation calls. The Asian particoloured bat is one of the few bat species that typically produce twins. Therefore, they represent a model system for exploring the inﬂuence of genetic factors on bat pup isolation call characteristics. In this paper, we recorded isolation calls from 16 pups at three days of age in the laboratory, conducted principal component analysis (PCA) on 13 acoustic parameters of isolation calls, and then performed discriminant function analysis (DFA). The DFA of acoustic parameters revealed that these calls carry information about individual identity. These results may indicate that there is acoustically mediated mother–infant recognition. Further analysis showed that twin siblings have more obvious call similarities than non-twins, which may be caused by genetic factors.",

The mechanisms by which mother bats recognize their pups and adult bats recognize each other are not clear. We hypothesized that such recognition is achieved by chemical discrimination and performed experiments to test the hypothesis. Results showed that mother bats were much more attracted to the scent from their own pups. For adult bats, females were attracted to the scent from both male and female groupmates but had a higher preference to the scent from female than from male groupmates. Male bats were much more attracted to the scent from male groupmates while showed no preference to the scent from female groupmates. Within a group, both female and male bats had no difference in preference to the scent from the same or opposite sex. These results suggest that mother–­pup and groupmate recognition of T. pachypus can be achieved by olfactory cues.",

The fungus causing the disease invades skin tissues of hibernating bats, resulting in disruption of hibernation behavior, premature energy depletion, and subsequent death. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate changes in allele frequencies within a population of Myotis lucifugus in eastern North America to search for genetic resistance to WNS. Our results show low FST values within the population across time, i.e., prior to WNS (PreWNS) compared to the population that has survived WNS (Post-WNS). However, when dividing the population with a geographical cut-off between the states of Pennsylvania and New York, a sharp increase in values on scaffold GL429776 is evident in the Post-WNS samples. Genes present in the diverged area are associated with thermoregulation and promotion of brown fat production. Thus, although WNS may not have subjected the entire M. lucifugus population to selective pressure, it may have selected for speciﬁc alleles in Pennsylvania through decreased gene ﬂow within the population. However, the persistence of remnant subpopulations in the aftermath of WNS is likely due to multiple factors in bat life history.",

            "abstractNote": "Although bats have been implicated as reservoir hosts for a number of zoonotic and life-threatening viruses, the bat bacterial ﬂora and its zoonotic threat remain elusive. However, members of the vector-borne bacterial genera Bartonella causing various human as well as animal diseases have recently been isolated or detected from bats and their ectoparasites. In this study, we sampled 124 insectivorous microbats (Daubenton’s bat, Myotis daubentonii) for peripheral blood in southwestern Finland in 2010. A Bartonella-speciﬁc PCR targeting rpoB (RNA polymerase b-subunit) was positive with blood samples from 46 bats (prevalence 37%). Scaled mass indexes of the infected and noninfected bats did not differ ( p = 0.057). One rpoB sequence was identical with the rpoB sequence of B. naantaliensis strain 2574/1, previously isolated from bats in Finland. The rest of the sequences were highly similar to each other with nucleotide identity scores of 96% or higher. Nucleotide identity scores to the previously described type strain sequences of Bartonella or other database entries were no higher than 87%. Sequence analyses of another gene, gltA (citrate synthase), gave no higher than 90% nucleotide identity scores. On the basis of the conventional 95% sequence similarity cutoff in bacterial species delineation, a novel species of Bartonella was detected. We propose a species name Candidatus B. hemsundetiensis. Phylogenetic analyses based on rpoB and gltA sequences indicate that Candidatus B. hemsundetiensis clusters in a deep-branching position close to the ancestral species B. tamiae and B. bacilliformis. Our study reinforces the importance of bats as reservoirs of Bartonella.",

The individual species were monophyletic and well supported by bootstrap and decay values. The monophyletic clade of ((((obscurus + planirostris) + amplus) + (lituratus + intermedius)) + jamaicensis) was also highly supported, although some of the interspecific relationships were less so. Contrary to previous hypotheses of species limits based on a presumed intergradation in body size, A. jamaicensis and A. planirostris do not form a monophyletic group, refuting their conspecificity and supporting an earlier study concluding that these two taxa represent separate morphological populations. An analysis with A. jamaicensis and A. planirostris constrained as sister-taxa resulted in a tree 8 steps longer. In addition, the low genetic pair-wise difference between A. lituratus and A. intermedius (2.8% with Kimura-2 parameters) warrants closer examination of their species limits.",

            "abstractNote": "While bats are important reservoirs and vectors of pathogenic agents with zoonotic potential, their skin-­associated microbial community could harbour organisms relevant to bat health as well as those associated with bat habitats in general. A total of 140 skin swabs collected from bats in the Czech Republic were cultured for bacteria from 2012 to 2013. A phytopathogen, isolated from a lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros), was identified as Lonsdalea quercina by MALDI-­TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption–ionization time-­of-­flight mass spectrometry) and characterized as Lonsdalea quercina subsp. britannica using phylogenetic analysis based on a 16S rRNA and two housekeeping (infB and atpD) genes. Lonsdalea quercina subsp. britannica is a gram-­negative facultative anaerobic bacterium reported to cause bark canker and drippy nut disease in oaks. Our finding provides evidence of Lonsdalea quercina in the Czech Republic (Moravian Karst). As the lesser horseshoe bat is a sedentary species, it may bio-­indicate the presence of the phytopathogenic bacterium in the broadleaved forests of the habitat of pathogen recovery. We therefore suggest active surveillance of the area of the Moravian Karst for signs of oak disease and/or decline.",

Numerous nonrandom associations as measured by information indices of similarity (KULIBACK 1959; SEMKIN 1972; ZAKfiAROV et al. 1987) were found between related and unrelated individuals. The social group structure revealed by multidimensional scaling analysis was affected first of all by the history of group formation, and also by bat age and sex. Spatial bonds were in general stronger between related than unrelated bats. However, nearly all closest associations observed were formed by at best distantly related bats; family membership influenced the socio-spatial positions of noctules far less than the above-mentioned variables did. It is suggested that emergence and persistence of nonrandom associations is mainly due to individual attainment of a certain level of comfort in company of familiar conspecifics whose behaviour is predictable, and thus reduction of aggression within a group. Other benefits of stable associations would be derived from this primary function.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats may exhibit plasticity in echolocation pulses as response to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and the estimation of the magnitude of such variation can provide confidence in acoustic monitoring. Myotis nigricans (Schinz, 1821) is a widely distributed but relatively understudied Neotropical species for which, during fieldwork, we found maternity colonies in the Lagunas de Montebello National Park, in Chiapas, South-east Mexico, and no previous information in the area. Therefore, we aimed to provide an acoustic characterization on the basis of intraspecific variability for its recognition using bat detectors. For this purpose, we examined the moulding of shape, frequency-based and time-based acoustic parameters, specifically by the effect of age group (sub-adults vs. adults) and acoustic environment (open space vs. background vegetation). By graphic comparison of echolocation pulses between acoustic environments, we observed changes in shape by an increase in bandwidth and steeper modulation along background vegetation. Statistically, on univariate basis, we did not find a significant effect of age group, but we did of acoustic environment, specifically on highest frequency (higher average), duration (shorter average) and interpulse interval (shorter average) along background vegetation. On multivariate basis, we confirmed shorter average interpulse interval along background vegetation. The overall classification accuracy was relatively high (82.22%): 80% in open space and 84% along background vegetation. Our work reinforces previous knowledge about sound constraints imposed by vegetation clutter, and provides a reliable framework for acoustic monitoring of this species across structurally variable, and hence acoustically variable, environments in the area.",

We asked whether the patterns of zeta diversity differ between (a) infracommunities and component communities; (b) ecto- and endoparasites and (c) subsets of communities infecting male and female bats. The pattern of compositional turnover differed between infracommunities and component communities in endoparasites only. The shape of zeta decline for infracommunities indicated that there were approximately equal probabilities of ecto- and endoparasitic species to occur on/in any bat individual within a site. The shape of zeta decline for component communities suggested the stochasticity of ectoparasite turnover, whereas the turnover of endoparasites was driven by niche-based processes. Compositional turnover in component communities of ectoparasites was more spatially dependent than that of endoparasites. Spatial independence of compositional turnover in endoparasites was due to subcommunities harboured by female bats. We conclude that the patterns of compositional turnover in infracommunities were similar in ecto- and endoparasites, whereas the patterns of turnover in component communities differed between these groups.",

To assess interactions, we consider distinct traits that are probably to be triggered by niche shape and evolutionary processes. We present data on the trophic niche differentiation between two sympatric European trawling bat species, Myotis dasycneme and Myotis daubentonii, incorporating a wide spectrum of methodological approaches. We measure morphological traits involved in foraging and prey handling performance including bite force, weightlifting capacity and wing morphology. We then measure resulting prey consumption using both morphological and molecular diet analyses. These species closely resemble each other in morphological traits, however, subtle but signiﬁcant differences were apparent in bite force and lift capacity, which are related to differences in basic body and head size. Both morphological and molecular diet analyses show strong niche overlap. We detected subtle differences in less frequent prey items, as well as differences in the exploitation of terrestrial and aquatic-based prey groups. Myotis dasycneme feeds more on aquatic prey, like Chironomidae and their pupal stages, or on the aquatic moth Acentria ephemerella. Myotis daubentonii feeds more on terrestrial prey, like Brachycera, or Coleoptera. This suggests that these bats use different microhabitats within the habitat where they co-occur.",

            "abstractNote": "Developing an effective conservation strategy for a critically endangered species relies on identifying the most pressing threats to the species. One approach to elucidate these threats for a long-lived animal with high territorial fidelity is to identify factors associated with territorial abandonment. The Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) has declined dramatically in southern Africa over the past few decades, with nearly 50% of known territories being abandoned. In this study we examine the evidence for 3 hypotheses: that territorial abandonment was associated with (1) human impact, (2) food availability, or (3) climate change, or a combination of these. Model selection was used to determine the relative importance of 7 covariates within the home range of an adult pair, an area of 10 km radius (314 km2) around each nest. Our analyses provided strongest support for the human impact hypothesis, with abandonment more likely in territories with more power lines and higher densities of human settlements. Additionally, within Lesotho, southern Africa, there was some support for the food shortage hypothesis, with territories more likely to have remained occupied where they had a greater number of feeding sites within close proximity. Our data provided no support for the hypothesis that climate change may be driving abandonment through a direct impact of elevation or nest site aspect. Our results are in accordance with the main causes of mortality: poisoning and power line collisions. We suggest that conservation measures should focus on limiting the development of further human settlements and power lines within 10 km of occupied territories, applying mitigation measures to existing power lines and increasing law enforcement and education in areas still occupied by the species.",

The use of torpor is a common energy saving strategy employed by microbats in temperate regions. The efficiency of entry into, and arousal from, torpor is governed by roost microclimate, primarily roost temperature. The large-footed myotis Myotis macropus roosts in both tree cavities and a man-made tunnel at Yan Yean reservoir in Victoria, Australia. We investigated the thermal properties of both roost types in comparison to available tree cavities and ambient temperature over four time periods from October 2003 to May 2005. Tree cavities and tunnel roosts remained significantly warmer at night, cooler during the day, and were more stable than ambient temperatures. In addition, roost tree cavities were significantly cooler between 10:00–13:00 h compared to available tree cavities, and there was a trend for roost tree cavities to be slightly warmer at night and slower to reach maximum temperature relative to available tree cavities during the breeding season (October–January). In contrast, there was little difference in roost and available tree cavity temperatures outside of the breeding season (April–May). Temperatures inside tunnel roosts were more stable and were significantly cooler during the afternoon compared to roost tree cavities during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons. Myotis macropus may actively trade-off the enhanced thermoregulatory benefits of warm roosts for reduced predation risk associated with the tunnel roosting environment.",

Considered a species of conservation concern throughout much of its range, protection efforts would greatly benefit from understanding patterns of population structure, genetic diversity, and local adaptation. To facilitate such research, we present the first de novo genome assembly of C. townsendii as part of the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP). Pacific Biosciences HiFi long reads and Omni-C chromatin-proximity sequencing technologies were used to produce a de novo genome assembly, consistent with the standard CCGP reference genome protocol. This assembly comprises 391 scaffolds spanning 2.1 Gb, represented by a scaffold N50 of 174.6 Mb, a contig N50 of 23.4 Mb, and a benchmarking universal single-copy ortholog (BUSCO) completeness score of 96.6%. This high-quality genome will be a key tool for informed conservation and management of this vulnerable species in California and across its range.",

            "abstractNote": "Feeding of tawny owl, Strix aluco, was studied from 14 localities of northern and central Italy, where it preyed mainly upon mammals and birds, but amphibians and invertebrates were also frequently eaten. Predation upon mammals was more important from autumn to spring, when alternative prey (amphibians, birds and invertebrates) were less available. The food niche overlaps, the linear distances (in km) between the various localities were negatively correlated, and the mean size of prey taken increased with the proportion of forested territory. However, where tawny owl preyed upon large forest mammals, it also preyed upon larger mammals not typical of forests. Considering the relationships between forest structure and tawny owl diet, it was found that forest density was positively correlated with the proportion of arvicolids and negatively with prey size diversity and the proportion of myoxids. The amount of forest territory within 1 km radius from each pellet collection site largely explained diet variability. Results of discriminant analysis, in addition, suggested that tawny owl is likely to avoid thick Mediterranean coppice forests as hunting habitats.",

The C. brachyotis roosts were distributed between 600–1,500 m. Day roosts were found at an elevation of about 1,000m in Sirumalai and Yercaud Hill stations. Mist-netting studies, however, revealed that C. brachyotis was widely distributed at different elevations ranging from 600–1,500 m. Moreover, through a radio-telemetry study, we determined that the males foraged at shorter distances from the day roost, whereas the females commuted longer distances and used more than one foraging area. The male bats’ time of emergence is significantly less than females; in addition, males frequently return to their day-roost and made several short foraging flights spaced randomly throughout the night. These observations suggest that some type of territoriality is associated with their roost, which appears to be the basis of social organization in C. brachyotis. Overall, this study provides detailed information about the foraging and roosting ecology of C. brachyotis in southern India.",

Most of the neoplastic cells in the liver and lung showed positive labeling for HepPar-1, cytokeratin 19, glypican-3, and Ki-67. Hepatocellular degeneration and necrosis were diffuse in the liver parenchyma. Berlin blue staining revealed large amounts of iron in normal and neoplastic cells. Based on these pieces of evidence, this case was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma with hemochromatosis. This is believed to be the first report of hepatocellular carcinoma in an Egyptian fruit bat that has been immunophenotypically examined in detail by pathological examination.",

To study the link between owl predation and anti-predator behaviour in bats, we evaluated seven months of video recordings at roosts and the behaviour of 51 passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagged bats and bats without tags in a geographically isolated colony of greater noctule bats (\n              Nyctalus lasiopterus\n              ) in Spain. We found the tawny owl\n              Strix aluco\n              to almost continuously hunt\n              N. lasiopterus\n              , from perches and on the wing, well after the bats emerged at dusk and when they returned to their roosts. We recorded 39 unsuccessful and three successful attacks. Nonetheless, we found no evidence that owl predation modifies bat behaviour. While the bats constituted only a very small proportion of the owls' diet, owl predation accounted for an estimated 30–40% of bat mortality, which may have a significant impact on small, local or isolated bat populations, in particular, and thereby shape regional bat distributions. We hypothesize that low roost availability may also affect the bats’ potential response to predation, which could lead to natural predation having an excessive impact on bat populations.",

Ground-based detection methods would underrepresent bats that use the canopy and above-canopy airspace in this forest as they reach far beyond practical netting and acoustic detection range. We equipped two tall trees with full spectrum automated bat detectors at treetop (108 m), lower crown (55 m), and ground level (5 m) from April 2008 to November 2009, excluding December and January. We sampled 1,365 detector nights, recorded 3,769 echolocation sequences (bat passes), and found 12 species, two of which, Lasiurus blossevillii and Tadarida brasiliensis, that had no prior documented presence in redwood forests. The maximum proportion of bat activity occurred at treetop, although ground level species diversity exceeded that of the lower crown and treetop, and species composition differed among locations. Non-Myotis species composed 95% of the calls at the treetop, 88% at lower crown, and 21% at ground level. Calls from Myotis species averaged 71% of all calls recorded at ground level compared to less than 4% at both lower crown and treetop. Activity declined markedly, but did continue, during the winter months we sampled. The combination of a temperate climate and observations of larger, migratory species during November, February, and March suggested the potential for resident populations or inland migrants overwintering in this forest. These findings emphasize the importance of sampling throughout the calendar year and including the full reach of the vertical habitat when quantifying bat activity in forests.",

However, whether colonization and dispersal indeed reflect different biological processes in nature is unclear. One possibility to test this assumption is to assess patterns of autosomal and mitochondrial genetic structure in species with strict female philopatry, such as the communally breeding Bechstein’s bat. In this species, mitochondrial DNA can spread only when females establish new colonies, and autosomal DNA is transmitted among colonies only when females mate with solitary males born in foreign colonies. Investigating the genetic structure among 37 colonies, we found that autosomal genes followed an island model on a regional scale and a model of isolation by distance on a larger geographical scale. In contrast, mitochondrial genetic structure revealed no pattern of isolation by distance at a large scale but exhibited an effect of ecological barriers on a regional scale. Our results provide strong empirical evidence that colonization and dispersal do not follow the same behavioural rules in this bat, supporting the assumption of metapopulation genetic models.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fungal disease responsible for decimating many bat populations in North America.\n              Pseudogymnoascus destructans\n              (\n              Pd\n              ), the psychrophilic fungus responsible for WNS, prospers in the winter habitat of many hibernating bat species. The immune response that\n              Pd\n              elicits in bats is not yet fully understood; antibodies are produced in response to infection by\n              Pd\n              , but they may not be protective and indeed may be harmful. To understand how bats respond to infection during hibernation, we studied the effect of\n              Pd\n              inoculation on the survival and gene expression of captive hibernating\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              with varying pre-hibernation antifungal antibody titres. We investigated gene expression through the transcription of selected cytokine genes (\n              Il6\n              ,\n              Il17a\n              ,\n              Il1b\n              ,\n              Il4\n              and\n              Ifng\n              ) associated with inflammatory, Th1, Th2 and Th17 immune responses in wing tissue and lymph nodes. We found no difference in survival between bats with low and high anti-\n              Pd\n              titres, although anti-\n              Pd\n              antibody production during hibernation differed significantly between infected and uninfected bats. Transcription of\n              Il6\n              and\n              Il17a\n              was higher in the lymph nodes of infected bats compared with uninfected bats. Increased transcription of these cytokines in the lymph node suggests that a pro-inflammatory immune response to WNS is not restricted to infected tissues and occurs during hibernation. The resulting Th17 response may be protective in euthermic bats, but because it may disrupt torpor, it could be detrimental during hibernation.",

            "abstractNote": "Summary\n            \n              White‐nose syndrome, a disease that is caused by the psychrophilic fungus\n              Pseudogymnoascus destructans\n              , has threatened several North America bat species with extinction. Recent studies have shown that East Asian bats are infected with\n              P. destructans\n              but show greatly reduced infections. While several factors have been found to contribute to these reduced infections, the role of specific microbes in limiting\n              P. destructans\n              growth remains unexplored. We isolated three bacterial strains with the ability to inhibit\n              P. destructans\n              , namely,\n              Pseudomonas yamanorum\n              GZD14026,\n              Pseudomonas brenneri\n              XRD11711 and\n              Pseudomonas fragi\n              GZD14479, from bats in China.\n              Pseudomonas yamanorum\n              , with the highest inhibition score, was selected to extract antifungal active substance. Combining mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analyses, we identified the active compound inhibiting\n              P. destructans\n              as phenazine‐1‐carboxylic acid (PCA), and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 50.12 μg ml\n              −1\n              . Whole genome sequencing also revealed the existence of PCA biosynthesis gene clusters. Gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry (GC‐MS) analysis identified volatile organic compounds. The results indicated that 10 ppm octanoic acid, 100 ppm 3‐tert‐butyl‐4‐hydroxyanisole (isoprenol) and 100 ppm 3‐methyl‐3‐buten‐1‐ol (BHA) inhibited the growth of\n              P. destructans\n              . These results support that bacteria may play a role in limiting the growth of\n              P. destructans\n              on bats.",

Previous studies have shown that grooming is a means by which animals clean themselves, remove ectoparasites, and lower their body temperature. It is also involved in olfactory communication. Bats belong to the order Chiroptera and, like most mammals, are the natural host of many ectoparasites. Bat grooming, including licking and scratching, is one of the ways to reduce the adverse effects caused by ectoparasites. Bat grooming may also be induced by exogenous odor. In this study, we used lesser flat‐headed bats (Tylonycteris pachypus) to test the hypothesis that exogenous odor affects the self‐grooming behavior of bats. Results showed that external odor from distantly related species caused lesser flat‐headed bats to spend more time in self‐grooming. Lesser flat‐headed bats that received odor from humans spent the longest time in self‐grooming, followed by those that received odor from a different species of bats (T. robustula). Lesser flatheaded bats that received odor form the same species of bats, either from the same or a different colony, spent the least amount of time in self‐grooming. These results suggest that bats can recognize conspecific and heterospecific through body scent.",

Their forearm lengths were slightly smaller than the average for Vespertilio sinensis. We identified these three individuals as V. murinus using both morphological and molecular approaches, and discussed their possible migration or vagrancy routes. Prior to the first record of V. murinus on Rebun Island near Hokkaido in 2002, there was no record of this species in Japan. These new occurrences illustrate the importance of determining possible migration or vagrancy routes of bats for understanding and preventing the spread of zoonotic diseases.",

One adult male used a home range of 37.5 ha (95 % Mf.P), and traveled 1412 ± 272 m in a 1/2 night. Olingos appear to share many ecological and behavioral traits with kinkajous, and competition for food may limit the abundance and distribution of the threatened olingo.",

Statistical analysis of sonar calls provides evidence that variation carries social information about a caller, including individual identity. We hypothesized that little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) would be able to recognize individuals given the potential ﬁtness beneﬁts of doing so. We performed playback trials using a habituation-discrimination design to determine whether little brown bats are able to recognize the individual identity of a caller based on variation in their sonar calls. Each subject bat was played the calls of bat A until they habituated (deﬁned as a 50% decrease from the beginning call rate), then the calls of bat B or a new call sequence of bat A (a control, referred to as bat A’) were played. Each subject received a unique pair of playback recordings (bat A and B) from adult female bats from the same colony (but a different colony from the subject) and the order of trials was randomized. The response measures were habituation time (s) and call rate (calls ⁄ s). Within a trial, subjects habituated to calls of bat A and transferred this habituation to the bat A’ sequence. In addition, they increased their call rates when played calls of bat B. Comparing between trials, subjects increased their call rate to the calls of bat B to a greater relative extent than to the calls of bat A’. These results provide the ﬁrst evidence that bats recognize individual identity of conspeciﬁcs (as opposed to discrimination of groups), which has implications for the social interactions of bats.",

If variation in call features reliably reﬂects characteristics of individuals, then there is potential for information transfer to conspeciﬁcs. Thus, sonar calls, in addition to their use in orientation and prey location, may function for communication. We obtained recordings of sonar calls from 66 little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) captured from buildings at Chautauqua Institution, State University of New York at Fredonia campus, and surrounding areas in 2003–2005. Calls were recorded using a laptop computer, digitizing card, connector box, ampliﬁer, and U30 bat detector while the bat crawled from hand to hand and while in ﬂight. Calls were extracted and analyzed using custom computer programs to generate measurements for variables describing each call, which were then analyzed statistically. Our analysis revealed individual identity, state of lactation, and age category are reliably indicated by call variation of crawling bats, and individual identity information is contained in calls of bats in ﬂight. To our knowledge these results are the 1st report of differences between sonar calls of lactating and nonlactating individuals for any bat species and individual differences in sonar calls for M. lucifugus. Individual identity information is available in calls produced within a situation; however, this information does not transfer well to the calls of the same bats produced in different situations. Our results suggest that the potential for communication of information via sonar calls depends on calling situation.",

Smith, 1833) is the only true Eptesicus Rafinesque, 1820 of the six southern African species (capensis, cf. melckorum, rendalli, somalicus and zuluensis) formerly classified as Eptesicus. GTG-banded chromosomes studied in rendalli, zuluensis and capensis confirm the affiliation of all of them to the genus Neoromicia; these species were previously placed in the Pipistrellus Kaup, 1829, subgenus Neoromicia based on bacular morphology. For karyological reasons, the elevation of the subgenus Neoromicia to generic rank is established by the presence of three Robertsonian fusion chromosomes (7/11, 8/9, 10/12) as distinguishing characters. The move of Hypsugo nanus and cf. melckorum to the genus Neoromicia is indicated by chromosomal analysis and bacular morphology, respectively. The close phylogenetic relationship between Pipistrellus cf. kuhlii and P. rusticus is shown by a shared Robertsonian fusion element (11/12).",

All six bats of a zoo colony died of septicaemia in circumstances which strongly suggest that the presence of the mites or their feeding caused a severe irritation, which incited the bats to lacerate their own ears. These self-inflicted injuries may have allowed microorganisms, growing on extravasated fluids, to enter the lesions and kill the bats. This type of self-inflicted injury has apparently not been reported before for wild or captive Chiroptera.",

North American hibernating bat species are threatened by the psychrophilic fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) causing the disease called white-nose syndrome (WNS) with unprecedented mortality rates. The fungus is widespread in North America and Europe, however, disease is not manifested in European bats. Differences in epidemiology and pathology indicate an evolution of resistance or tolerance mechanisms towards Pd in European bats. We compared the proteomic profile of blood plasma in healthy and Pd-colonized European Myotis myotis and North American Myotis lucifugus in order to identify pathophysiological changes associated with Pd colonization, which might also explain the differences in bat survival. Expression analyses of plasma proteins revealed differences in healthy and Pd-colonized M. lucifugus, but not in M. myotis. We identified differentially expressed proteins for acute phase response, constitutive and adaptive immunity, oxidative stress defence, metabolism and structural proteins of exosomes and desmosomes, suggesting a systemic response against Pd in North American M. lucifugus but not European M. myotis. The differences in plasma proteomic profiles between European and North American bat species colonized by Pd suggest European bats have evolved tolerance mechanisms towards Pd infection.",

In spite of their species diversity, previous work on Artibeus crania using linear morphometrics has uncovered limited interspecific variation. This dearth of shape variation suggests that differences in cranial morphology are not contributing to niche partitioning across species, many of which are often found in sympatry. Using two-dimensional geometric morphometric methods on crania from eleven species from the Artibeus species complex, the current study demonstrates substantial cranial interspecific variation, sexual size and shape dimorphism, and intraspecific geographic variation. The majority of species were shown to have a unique size and shape, which suggests that each species may be taking advantage of slightly different ecological resources. Further, both sexual size and shape dimorphism were significant in the Artibeus species complex. Male and female Artibeus are known to have sex specific foraging strategies, with males eating near their roosts and females feeding further from their roosts. The presence of cranial sexual dimorphism in the Artibeus species complex, combined with previous work showing that different fruit size and hardness is correlated with different cranial shapes in phyllostomids, indicates that the males and females may be utilizing different food resources, leading to divergent cranial morphotypes. Additional field studies will be required to confirm this emergent hypothesis. Finally, significant geographical shape variation was found in a large intraspecific sample of Artibeus lituratus crania. However, this variation was not correlated with latitude and instead may be linked to local environmental factors. Additional work on ecology and behavior in the Artibeus species complex underlying the morphological variation uncovered in this study will allow for a better understanding of how the group has reached its present diversity.",

The bats were trained to localize pure tones throughout most of their hearing range from loudspeakers located 30° to the left and right of midline. Both species easily localized high frequency tones, indicating they could use the interaural intensity difference cue. However, neither was able to localize low frequency tones even when the tones were amplitude modulated thereby indicating that they could not use ongoing phase difference cues. The authors now know of eight mammals that do not use binaural phase cues for localization, and some possible reasons for this inability are explored.",

In contrast, in climatically less seasonal habitats, reproductive timing may be determined by a wide variety of seasonal factors. Three hypotheses regarding reproductive timing were tested for a fruit bat, Huplonycteris Jischeri Lawrence, by comparing reproductive timing and climate at four moderately seasonal Philippine sites with differing climates. Bats were sampled in five years on Negros Island (9″22′N, 123″l I'E), and in one to four months on four other islands. Flower and fruit abundance was monitored in two years on Negros. In five years on Negros, parturition and lactation coincided with the time of the average dry‐wet season transition and early wct season, but did not vary in response to substantial annual variation in the onset of rains. Reproductive timing did not change in response to annual variations in Rower or fruit abundance; lactation coincided with a peak in fruit abundance in one year, but not in a second, and reproductive success appeared to be reduced when lactation coincided with scarce resources. At a second site with a different pattern of rainfall, reproduction was nevertheless synchronous with Negros. Samples from two of the three remaining localities indicate a two‐ to three‐month lag in reproductive events relative to Negros, despite rainfall patterns remarkably similar to that of Negros. All three hypotheses for reproductive timing were rejected. As an alternative, Huplonycteris may evolve timing patterns in response to local seasonal patterns of resource abundance.\n            Huplonycteris has an eight‐month post‐implantation delay 'in embryonic development. Six hypotheses on the adaptive significance of this delay in Huplonyrferis were evaluated. Three were rejected, but the data were consistent with the remaining hypotheses: (1) The delay sets the time of parturition at a particular time of year; (2) the delay allows all females to produce young relatively synchronously; and (3) the delay allows females to resorb or abort defective embryos without losing an opportunity for reproduction.",

Two ‘cryptic’ biological species are shown to occur in sympatry on both Bougainville and Choiseul in the northern Solomon Islands (corresponding to Pteralopex anceps Andersen, 1909 and a previously undescribed species) and each is accordingly described and reviewed. A new genus (Mirimiri) is erected for the Fijian monkey-faced bat (formerly Pteralopex acrodonta), which differs greatly both morphologically and genetically from species of Pteralopex in the Solomon Islands. Ecomorphological differences between sympatric Pteralopex species are brieﬂy reviewed, including potential differences in functional morphology and feeding ecology. Geographic patterns of occurrence and future survey priorities for monkey-faced bats are also discussed.",

In the past, 2 species have been described—D. spadiceus (Thomas, 1890), described from Borneo and later recorded from the Malay Peninsula, and D. brooksi Thomas, 1920, described from Sumatra. These 2 nominal taxa are often recognized as species or conspeciﬁc subspecies representing these respective populations. Our examinations instead suggest that both previously described species of Dyacopterus co-occur on the Sunda Shelf—the smaller-skulled D. spadiceus in peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo, and the larger-skulled D. brooksi in Sumatra and Borneo. We further identify specimens of Dyacopterus from the large islands of Luzon and Mindanao in the Philippines as representatives of a distinctive new species, Dyacopterus rickarti. This new species differs from the Sundaic taxa in its much larger size, unique palatal ridge formula, and in qualitative craniodental features. The natural history of each species, so far as it is known, is brieﬂy reviewed.",

To provide insights on this species’ day-roosting habits, we successfully radiotracked 5 lactating females and 5 non-reproductive males to 57 day-roosts during June and July 2008. Eastern Small-footed Myotis used ground-level rock roosts in talus slopes and rock ﬁelds (n = 53), and roosts in vertical cliff faces (n = 4). Ground-level roosts had low canopy cover (males: xࣛ = 14.1 ± 2.1 [SE] %, females: xࣛ = 19.6 ± 3.1%), but were located close to vegetation (males: xࣛ = 3.6 ± 0.4 m, females: xࣛ = 4.8 ± 0.8 m). Males switched roosts every 1.1 ± 0.04 days, traveled 41.2 ± 7.8 m between consecutive roosts, and roosted 415 ± 49.0 m from capture locations. Females switched roosts every 1.1 ± 0.06 days, traveled 66.5 ± 14.6 m between consecutive roosts, and roosted 368 ± 24.0 m from capture locations. Ground-level roosts used by females were closer to ephemeral water sources (xࣛ = 226 ± 31.2 m, n = 25) than those used by males (xࣛ = 458 ± 16.7 m, n = 28; W = 401, P < 0.01). These data illustrate the importance of rock habitat with high solar exposure near protective cover and water in day-roost selection by Eastern Small-footed Myotis.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a fungal disease caused by Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) that affects bats during hibernation. Although millions of bats have died from WNS in North America, mass mortality has not been observed among European bats infected by the fungus, leading to the suggestion that bats in Europe are immune. We tested the hypothesis that an antibody-mediated immune response can provide protection against WNS by quantifying antibodies reactive to Pd in blood samples from seven species of free-ranging bats in North America and two free-ranging species in Europe. We also quantiﬁed antibodies in blood samples from little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) that were part of a captive colony that we injected with live Pd spores mixed with adjuvant, as well as individuals surviving a captive Pd infection trial. Seroprevalence of antibodies against Pd, as well as antibody titers, was greater among little brown myotis than among four other species of cave-hibernating bats in North America, including species with markedly lower WNS mortality rates. Among little brown myotis, the greatest titers occurred in populations occupying regions with longer histories of WNS, where bats lacked secondary symptoms of WNS. We detected antibodies cross-reactive with Pd among little brown myotis na€ıve to the fungus. We observed high titers among captive little brown myotis injected with Pd. We did not detect antibodies against Pd in Pdinfected European bats during winter, and titers during the active season were lower than among little brown myotis. These results show that antibody-mediated immunity cannot explain survival of European bats infected with Pd and that little brown myotis respond differently to Pd than species with higher WNS survival rates. Although it appears that some species of bats in North America may be developing resistance to WNS, an antibody-mediated immune response does not provide an explanation for these remnant populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats in North America are currently experiencing dramatic population declines due to the disease white-nose syndrome. The long-term viability of vulnerable species requires recognition of critical habitats, including those also occupied by humans. Our study aimed to quantify the importance of buildings to little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) in Yellowstone National Park, a high-elevation landscape with relatively few human structures and abundant alternative roosting habitat. We measured roost preferences and thermoregulation in adult male and female bats roosting in buildings, trees, and rocks using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. We also studied microclimates within each roost type for comparison to roost preferences. We found reproductive females roosting in building attics on 84% of all possible days, while males roosted exclusively in rock crevices or in trees. This dichotomous roosting pattern reﬂected differences in roost microclimates. All roost types buffered bats from daily minimum ambient temperatures; however, buildings were more insulated from low ambient temperatures during the middle of the maternity season. Male bats roosting in rocks and trees predominantly thermoconformed to roost temperatures, while females roosting in buildings sustained higher body temperatures than males throughout the day. Pregnant and lactating females also used torpor frequently, with skin temperatures reaching <10°C, and a gestation period lasting 49–89 d. These results show that cool summer temperatures at high elevations present an energetic challenge to little brown myotis. Buildings provide critical habitat for reproductive females and likely allow for larger populations than would be possible in their absence, making these roosts a priority for long-term conservation of this declining species.",

Migrating silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans (Le Conte, 1831)) were captured at a stopover site in Long Point, Ontario, Canada, in April and May of 2012–2014. We followed the movements of 40 bats outﬁtted with radio transmitters using an automated telemetry array and examined the effects of ambient temperature, fat stores, and sex on stopover duration. As seen previously in autumn, most bats departed the evening following capture, but one-third of bats used multiday stopovers. Extended stopover was associated with lower ambient temperature. There was no effect of sex or fat at capture on stopover departure probability. Bats captured closer to dawn had greater fat mass and lean mass than those captured early in the night, a trend indicative of fuel deposition at this site. This is the ﬁrst study to provide evidence that bats use stopover habitat for refuelling.",

            "abstractNote": "Summary The New Zealand short-tailed bat Mystacina tuberculata evolved in the absence of terrestrial mammals and initially with few potential predators. Unusual among bats, it is well adapted for the capture of prey on the ground. Bats from Fiordland, New Zealand had relatively low wing loadings and aspect ratios adapted for ﬂight in cluttered habitats. We predicted that M. tuberculata would locate prey in air (uncluttered space) by echolocation. Echolocation call sequences associated with prey capture (terminal buzzes) were heard in the ﬁeld, and bats detected and localized prey suspended on ﬁshing line by echolocation in a ﬂight cage. The bats emitted brief, multiharmonic echolocation calls at low duty cycle during search phase, and 64% of calls contained most energy in the fundamental harmonic. Approach- and terminalphase calls were also broadband and multiharmonic. We predicted that bats would not use echolocation to locate prey hidden on the ground in leaf litter (cluttered space). Bats seemed unable to locate hidden prey precisely from the air and instead hunted for such prey while crawling. Echolocation calls were emitted at a low repetition rate on the ground, suggesting that here echolocation was used for orientation and not for prey detection. We experimentally removed cues available to the bats and showed that bats located mealworms in leaf litter by listening for preygenerated noises and possibly by olfaction.",

We present background information, relevant comparisons, and clariﬁcation of analyses to further strengthen our conclusions. The genesis of the original “evotis–keenii” study in British Columbia (Canada) was to differentiate Myotis keenii (Merriam, 1895) (Keen’s myotis), with one of the smallest North American bat distributions, from sympatric Myotis evotis (H. Allen, 1864) (long-eared myotis), using something other than the suggested postmortem skull size comparison, but no differentiating trait could be found, leading to the molecular genetics examination of C.L. Lausen et al. (2019). We present cumulative data that rejects the 1979 hypothesis of M. keenii as a distinct species. A.E. Morales et al. (2021) inaccurately portray C.L. Lausen et al.’s (2019) question and results; present inaccurate morphological and outdated distribution data; overstate the impact of homoplasy without supporting evidence; and misinterpret evidence of population structure.",

We documented roosting behaviour and roost selection. During pregnancy and lactation, individuals aggregated as several small groups or one large group (maternity colony). Postlactating females roosted alone more frequently. During postlactation, individuals periodically returned to roost with a group dominated by pups, between periods of roosting alone. We identified 72 roosts used by members of the colony. Adult females switched roosts frequently and few roosts (24%) were reused. During pregnancy and lactation, the colony roosted in a 1.25-km length of the river valley on the northwest side of the river. With the onset of postlactation, females began roosting on both sides of the river and within a longer section of the river valley, and roosts faced in a more southerly direction. Crevices selected as roosts were more vertical in orientation, were farther from level ground above, and had openings that were smaller than those randomly available. Roosts used during pregnancy, lactation, and postlactation differed in physical attributes; lactation roosts were deeper and had larger openings. Selection of crevices with particular attributes suggested that selection was based on microclimate and avoidance of predation.",

We compiled and examined a data set of Eastern Red Bat capture and acoustic records from northern Alberta to examine their distribution, seasonality, and reproductive status near the edge of their range. Acoustic data suggested widespread but patchy distribution across Alberta. The number of captures of Eastern Red Bats in northern Alberta were similar to those of Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus), suggesting that the species may be more common than previously thought. However, we failed to find evidence of reproduction in female Eastern Red Bats in Alberta. Small sample sizes, timing of surveys or difficulty in recognizing juveniles may explain the apparent lack of reproduction. Similar to Hoary Bats, reproductive adult male Eastern Red Bats have been captured with enlarged testes in northern Alberta in August, suggesting sperm production and possibly the start of breeding is taking place there in late summer. In northern Alberta, acoustic monitoring in early spring provided evidence of migratory bats early in the season. A better understanding of seasonal movement patterns and migration, habitat use, and reproduction of Eastern Red Bats in western Canada will require further study. Regardless, our data provide further evidence that the Eastern Red Bat is a more regular member of the bat fauna of northwestern Canada than previously recognized, which may be a result of an expanding distribution.",

Using radio-telemetry, thermoregulatory patterns and roost microclimate were recorded for pregnant, lactating and post-lactating females. Relative torpor use is described in several ways: the proportion of days on which torpor was used, depth, minimum body temperature, time spent in torpor, and a comprehensive torpor unit (degree-min). Pregnant and lactating female E. fuscus used torpor to the same extent overall (degree-min), but pregnant bats used torpor less frequently and with more time in deep torpor. Torpor was used to the greatest extent after weaning (post-lactation). Evidence is presented that the cost : beneﬁt ratio for deep and prolonged periods of torpor may be highest during lactation. Microclimates of rockcrevice roosts mirrored the use of torpor throughout reproduction by bats. Lactation roosts (deeper, larger opening size) were more thermally stable and remained warmer at night compared to the shallow roosts used by pregnant and post-lactating females. It is shown that conclusions about relative use of torpor can differ depending on the units of comparison, necessitating measurement of all aspects of torpor (depth, duration and frequency). Comprehensive measurements, individual-based normothermic temperatures, and a deﬁnition of torpor that accounts for all energy savings, allow a more accurate depiction of patterns and facilitates inter-study comparisons.",

While considerable focus has been on signals used by bats for echolocation, there has been less emphasis on nonecholocation sounds. We describe songs (i.e., acoustic vocalizations with distinctive syllable types in series or in complex motifs) produced by silver‐haired bat (\n              Lasionycteris noctivagans\n              ). Songs, characterized by a sequence (song phrase) of 3 distinct vocalization types, were confirmed by observing free‐flying, silver‐haired bats at mine hibernacula in British Columbia, Canada. The song patterns were relatively consistent with each song phrase consisting of a lead call, followed by a droplet call, and finishing with a series of multiple chirp calls. The function of the songs is unknown, however, as other bat species produce songs for mating, we propose silver‐haired bat songs may similarly be associated with courtship or mating. Alternative functions cannot be ruled out, particularly because we recorded some songs outside of the accepted mating period. Other research has determined peak mating of silver‐haired bats occurs in fall, and spring mating has been documented. Here we additionally provide evidence of winter mating in British Columbia. The proportion of silver‐haired bat songs recorded relative to echolocation recordings varied across locations and seasons. While we recorded songs in all months of the year, more than half of the songs were produced during winter, and 93.4% (of 1,857) were produced outside of summer months. Song production in summer could be associated with other behaviors such as learning or practice, establishing or maintaining social bonds, or male‐male competition. To provide landscape and temporal context, we summarize acoustic datasets from numerous locations in western North America where recordings were made between 2005 and 2022.",

            "abstractNote": "Recognizing delineations of gene ﬂow among groups of animals can be challenging but is necessary for conservation and management. Of particular importance is the identiﬁcation of species boundaries. Several physical and genetic traits have been used with mixed success to distinguish Myotis keenii (Merriam, 1895) (Keen’s myotis) and Myotis evotis (H. Allen, 1864) (long-eared myotis), but it is unclear whether species distinction is biologically warranted. We generated 12–14 microsatellite locus genotypes for 275 long-eared Myotis representing four species — M. keenii, M. evotis, Myotis septentrionalis (Trouessart, 1897) (northern myotis), and Myotis thysanodes Miller, 1897 (fringed myotis) — from across northwestern North America and 23 Myotis lucifugus (Le Conte, 1831) (little brown myotis) as the outgroup. Population genetic analyses revealed four well-deﬁned groups (species): M. septentrionalis, M. thysanodes, M. lucifugus, and a single group comprising M. keenii and M. evotis. We document high rates of gene ﬂow within M. evotis/M. keenii. Cytochrome b gene (mtDNA) sequencing failed to resolve morphologically identiﬁable species. We highlight the importance of geographically thorough investigation of genetic connectivity (nuclear markers) when assessing taxonomic status of closely related groups. We document a morphometric cline within M. evotis/M. keenii that may in part explain earlier analyses that led to the description of the smaller bodied M. keenii (type locality: Haida Gwaii). We conclude that M. keenii does not qualify as a genetic or biological species.",

But body size can evolve in parallel, reaching similar final states despite independent evolutionary and geographic origins, leading to faulty assumptions of evolutionary history. Here, we document parallel evolution in body size in the widely distributed leaf-nosed bat genus Hipposideros, which has misled both taxonomic and evolutionary inference. We sequenced reduced representation genomic loci and measured external morphological characters from three closely related species from the Solomon Islands archipelago, delimited by body size. Species tree reconstruction confirms the paraphyly of two morphologically designated species. The nonsister relationship between large-bodied H. dinops lineages found on different islands indicates that large-bodied ecomorphs have evolved independently at least twice in the history of this radiation. A lack of evidence for gene flow between sympatric, closely related taxa suggests the rapid evolution of strong reproductive isolating barriers between morphologically distinct populations. Our results position Solomon Islands Hipposideros as a novel vertebrate system for studying the repeatability of parallel evolution under natural conditions. We conclude by offering testable hypotheses for how geography and ecology could be mediating the repeated evolution of large-bodied Hipposideros lineages in the Solomon Islands.",

            "abstractNote": "A revelation of the genomic age has been the contributions of the mobile DNA segments called transposable elements to chromosome structure, function, and evolution in virtually all organisms. Substantial fractions of vertebrate genomes derive from transposable elements, being dominated by retroelements that move via RNA intermediates. Although many of these elements have been inactivated by mutation, several active retroelements remain. Vertebrate genomes also contain substantial quantities and a high diversity of cut-and-paste DNA transposons, but no active representative of this class has been identified in mammals. Here we show that a cut-and-paste element called\n              piggyBat,\n              which has recently invaded the genome of the little brown bat (\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              ) and is a member of the\n              piggyBac\n              superfamily, is active in its native form in transposition assays in bat and human cultured cells, as well as in the yeast\n              Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n              . Our study suggests that some DNA transposons are still actively shaping some mammalian genomes and reveals an unprecedented opportunity to study the mechanism, regulation, and genomic impact of cut-and-paste transposition in a natural mammalian host.",

            "abstractNote": "As a K-strategist and comparatively sedentary species, the lesser horseshoe bat Rhinolophus hipposideros is considered sensitive to changes in habitat quality. Knowledge of the species’ dietary requirements and use of foraging habitats is thus considered an essential prerequisite to manage its habitats adequately. Based on four large annual samples of faecal pellets from three different nursery colonies, including two consecutive years of sampling from one colony, we studied the diet of Central German populations of R. hipposideros. Consistent with findings of similar studies carried out in other parts of the distribution range of R. hipposideros, in our study, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Neuroptera represented the most important groups of prey for the studied colonies. However, Hemiptera made a comparatively larger contribution in our study than in others, and so did Hymenoptera in one of the colonies. We found seasonal compositional variation in all four annual samples, as well as compositional variation between samples from different colonies, but not between the two annual samples obtained in consecutive years from the same colony. Differences between colonies appeared at least to some extent to reflect differences in availability of foraging habitats. Our results are thus in agreement with the assumption of R. hipposideros being a largely opportunistic, generalist forager. Our findings are also consistent with a known preference by R. hipposideros of woodland as main foraging habitat, as previously established by other studies carried out in the northern part of the distribution range. However, the relative importance of Hemiptera, and in particular of Psyllidae, at certain times during the foraging season, suggests that the Central German colonies of R. hipposideros might have utilized commercial orchards and private fruit gardens for foraging during seasonal peaks in abundance of pest species of fruit trees. The implied ability of R. hipposideros to respond to seasonal abundance peaks of particular groups of prey in a range of habitats suggests that structural diversity might be key in maintaining viable populations of this species. The potential importance of orchards and fruit gardens in regions where such habitats are prevalent is likely to have relevant management implications.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats emit a series of echolocation calls with an increasing repetition rate (the terminal buzz) when attempting to capture prey. This is often used as an acoustic indicator of prey-capture attempts. However, because it is directly linked to foraging efficiency, predation success is a more useful measure than predation attempts in ecological research. The characteristics of echolocation calls that consistently signify predation success across different situations have not been identified. Owing to additional influencing factors, identification of these characteristics is particularly challenging for wild bats foraging in their natural environment compared with those in flight chambers. This study documented the natural foraging behavior of wild Japanese large-footed bats (Myotis macrodactylus) using synchronized acoustic and video recordings. From the video recordings, we could assign 137 attacks to three outcome categories: prey captured (51.8%), prey dropped (29.2%) and failed attempt (19%). Based on previous indications from laboratory studies that the length of the silent interval following the terminal buzz ( postbuzz pause) might reflect the prey-capture outcome, we compared post-buzz pause durations among categories of attack outcomes. The post-buzz pause was longest in the case of successful capture, suggesting that the length of the post-buzz pause is a useful acoustic indicator of predation success during natural foraging in M. macrodactylus. Our finding will advance the study of bat foraging behavior using acoustic data, including estimations of foraging efficiency and analyses of feeding habitat quality.",

We studied diet of the intermediate horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus affinis, and the temporal variations in prey resource use. We also measured prey availability in order to explore whether this species is a generalist or specialist feeder. A total of 665 fecal samples were collected from 133 captured individuals from January to December 2019 in a tropical rainforest of Penang Island (Malaysia). A descriptive analysis of samples revealed a total of eight insect prey orders. The main taxon was Coleoptera (Percent Volume >50%), followed by Isoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera, respectively (5–15%). Neuroptera and Psocoptera were occasionally found in the samples (each <1%). This result exhibits a degree of dietary specialization on coleopterans although the diet composition was flexible and significantly varied over time (among months and within nights). Based on light trapping, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera were frequent insects in the study area, while Isoptera was seasonally abundant. The correlation between variation in the diet and light trap for each prey taxon was mostly not statistically significant, suggesting that R. affinis do not consume prey in proportion to abundance and alternatively may discriminate between prey items when foraging and take prey in rank order. Given this, we further investigated the heavy consumption of absolute abundance of Coleoptera (high-ranking prey in diet). As a result, coleopterans were included in the diet regardless of the abundance of other prey showing a pattern of dietary specialization.",

The low body mass of juvenile bats may be a result of stresses associated with the initiation of flight, or may be an adaptation to reduce flight costs.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    To test these hypotheses, the body masses of adults and unknown aged juvenile big brown bats (\n                    Eptesicus fuscus\n                    ) were separately compared in August 1990 through to 1995. It was hypothesized that there should be little variation in the body mass of juveniles from year to year if low body mass is an adaption to reduce flight costs.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    The foraging behaviour and body masses of bats of known or estimated age were also compared in 1994 and 1995. Ambient temperature at sunset was greater in 1994 than in 1995. It was assumed that prey density and predictability increased with temperature, and hypothesized that if low body mass results from energetic stress, then this should be more apparent in 1995. Using radiotelemetry, the foraging behaviour of juvenile, yearling and adult\n                    E. fuscus\n                    was compared in 1994 and 1995 to determine whether young bats attempt to compensate for energetic shortfalls by foraging for longer, or emerging earlier, than adults.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Unknown‐aged juveniles did not differ significantly in body mass in August from 1990 through to 1995. Adults were significantly heavier in August in 1990 and 1994 than in 1991, 1993 and 1995. Known‐aged juveniles had lower body mass than adults in 1994, and lower wing loading than adults in 1995. Known‐aged juveniles did not differ in mass between 1994 and 1995, while adults were heavier in 1994.\n                \n                \n                  The foraging times for juvenile and adult bats were both significantly related to ambient temperature. However, the slope of this relationship was steeper for weaned juveniles than for adults. The foraging times of yearling and adults bats were not significantly different.\n                \n                \n                  The emergence times of juvenile and adult bats did not differ, nor did the emergence times of yearlings and adults. Emergence time did not differ significantly between 1994 and 1995.\n                \n                \n                  The results of the study suggest that juvenile bats maintain a low body mass even under conditions that permit adults to accumulate greater fat deposits. Juveniles do not forage earlier or for longer to compensate for poor foraging ability and increased energy expenditures resulting from the onset of flight. This suggests that, by maintaining a low body mass, juveniles reduce flight costs and the risk of predation at a time when flight and foraging are still developing.",

This protein assists viral polyprotein cleavage, host immune interference, and may play other roles in genome replication or transcription. Here, we report the solution NMR structure of a protein from the “SARS-unique region” of the bat coronavirus HKU9. The protein contains a frataxin fold or double-wing motif, which is an a 1 b fold that is associated with protein/protein interactions, DNA binding, and metal ion binding. High structural similarity to the human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus nsp3 is present. A possible functional site that is conserved among some betacoronaviruses has been identified using bioinformatics and biochemical analyses. This structure provides strong experimental support for the recent proposal advanced by us and others that the “SARS-unique” region is not unique to the human SARS virus, but is conserved among several different phylogenetic groups of coronaviruses and provides essential functions.",

            "abstractNote": "Bartonella species are facultative intracellular bacteria and recognized worldwide as emerging zoonotic pathogens. Bartonella were isolated or identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in bats and their ectoparasites worldwide, whereas the association between them was scarce, especially in Asia. In this study, a retrospective analysis with frozen samples was carried out to identify the genetic diversity of Bartonella in bats and their ectoparasites and to investigate the relationships of Bartonella carried by bats and their ectoparasites. Bats and their ectoparasites (bat flies and bat mites) were collected from caves in Hubei Province, Central China, from May 2018 to July 2020. Bartonella were screened by PCR amplification and sequencing of three genes (gltA, rpoB, and ftsZ). Bats, bat flies, and bat mites carried diverse novel Bartonella genotypes with a high prevalence. The sharing of some Bartonella genotypes between bats and bat flies or bat mites indicated a potential role of bat flies and bat mites as vectors of bartonellae, while the higher genetic diversity of Bartonella in bat flies than that in bats might be due to the vertical transmission of this bacterium in bat flies. Therefore, bat flies might also act as reservoirs of Bartonella. In addition, human-pathogenic B. mayotimonesis was identified in both bats and their ectoparasites, which expanded our knowledge on the geographic distribution of this bacterium and suggested a potential bat origin with bat flies and bat mites playing important roles in the maintenance and transmission of Bartonella.",

In our genetic analysis using two nuclear DNA segments of protein kinase C iota (PRKCI) and ubiquitin specific peptidase 9 (Usp9x), X-linked genes, together with two mitochondrial genes, i.e., nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1) and cytochrome b (Cyt b), we demonstrate that M. taiwanensis is closely related to M. pilosus, and largely divergent from two subspecies of M. adversus. Our analysis further shows that M. taiwanensis differs considerably from M. adversus in external and dental features. New records of M. taiwanensis from Shandong and Anhui provinces in eastern China are presented.",

In this study, a complete mitochondrial genome of a male individual of M. shuipuensis from Shuifu Village, Libo, Guizhou China (type locality) was sequenced using Illumina Hiseq. Total length of its genome is 16,585 bp, including two rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, 13 proteincoding genes, and a control region. The general arrangement of genes is similar to the other chiropteran mitochondrial genomes. The phylogenetic inference indicates M. shuipuensis and M. leucogaster have closer phylogenetic relationship than other taxa that deposited in NCBI-nt. The complete mitochondrial genome provides valuable information for further taxonomic and phylogenetic researches.",

Here we tested two predictions of the nichespecific cognitive strategies hypothesis in bats, which suggests that predatory species should rely more on object memory than on spatial memory for finding food and that the opposite is true of frugivorous and nectivorous species. Specifically, we predicted that: (1) predatory bats would readily learn to associate shapes with palatable prey and (2) once bats had made such associations, these would interfere with their subsequent learning of a spatial memory task. We trained freeflying Myotis nattereri to approach palatable and unpalatable insect prey suspended below polystyrene objects. Experimentally naïve bats learned to associate different objects with palatable and unpalatable prey but performed no better than chance in a subsequent spatial memory experiment. Because experimental sequence was predicted to be of consequence, we introduced a second group of bats first to the spatial memory experiment. These bats learned to associate prey position with palatability. Control trials indicated that bats made their decisions based on information acquired through echolocation. Previous studies have shown that bat species that eat mainly nectar and fruit rely heavily on spatial memory, reflecting the relative consistency of distribution of fruit and nectar compared with insects. Our results support the niche-specific cognitive strategies hypothesis and suggest that for gleaning and clutter-resistant aerial hawking bats, learning to associate shape with food interferes with subsequent spatial memory learning.",

Three methods of phylogenetic inference, parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian phylogenetics were used. Based on 402 bp of DNA sequence from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, placement of Craseonycteridae within the superfamily Rhinolophoidea was demonstrated. Our results also suggest close proximity of Craseonycteridae to Hipposideridae rather than to Rhinopomatidae, close relationships between Megadermatidae and Rhinolophidae, sister group position of Pteropodidae to Rhinolophoidea, and closer affiliation of Nycteridae with the infraorder Yangochiroptera. Spectral analysis was in agreement with all these outcomes except for closer relationships of Craseonycteris with Rhinopomatidae.",

As currently understood Gardnerycteris is formed by two species, G. crenulatum and G. koepckeae. However, it has been hypothesized that G. crenulatum might be a complex of species, from which the form G. c. keenani exhibits the clearest morphological differences from other populations of ‘crenulatum’. Species limits and relationships among forms of Gardnerycteris have been only partially explored on the basis of morphological variation. Herein, we obtained partial sequences of two mitochondrial genes (cytb and COX1) and one nuclear gene (RAG2) from representatives of G. koepckeae and G. c. keenani in order to clarify the relationships within the genus. Furthermore, we performed qualitative and quantitative morphological comparisons among G. crenulatum sensu stricto, G. c. keenani, and G. koepckeae to limit species. Our results support the monophyly of Gardnerycteris, as well as the molecular and morphological differentiation of G. c. keenani from other congeners. In the light of the results, we propose changes in the taxonomy of the genus, raising ‘keenani’ to the species level.",

The sequences were obtained from the four individuals and composition of nucleotide AT and GC was about 64.58% and 35.42%, respectively. The lengths of mitogenomes were ranged from 17 296 to 17 299 bp. Total 51 variable sites were observed in the four mitogenomes and 38 sites were singleton polymorphic sites. Phylogenic study revealed that the species would have relatively closed evolutionary distance with m. macrodactylus rather than other species in the genus, myotis. Present study will provide important genomic materials supporting confirmation of taxon of species called bats, which is included in one of the largest orders among the mammals.",

However, little is known about how these viruses interact with their natural hosts. We demonstrate a Betacoronavirus (subgenus Merbecovirus), PN-bCoV, in the intestine of its natural host, Nathusius’s Pipistrelle Bat (Pipistrellus nathusii), by combining molecular and microscopy techniques. Eighty-eight P. nathusii bat carcasses were tested for PN-bCoV RNA by RT-qPCR, of which 25 bats (28%) tested positive. PN-bCoV RNA was more often detected in samples of the intestinal tract than in other sample types. In addition, viral RNA loads were higher in intestinal samples compared to other sample types, both on average and in each individual bat. In one bat, we demonstrated Merbecovirus antigen and PN-bCoV RNA expression in intestinal epithelium and the underlying connective tissue using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. These results indicate that PN-bCoV has a tropism for the intestinal epithelium of its natural host, Nathusius’s Pipistrelle Bat, and imply that the fecal-oral route is a possible route of transmission.",

This has important conservation implications, particularly for range-restricted species in tropical regions. In this study, we provide new insight into the distribution and ecology of one such species, the Nimba otter-shrew (Micropotamogale lamottei Heim de Balsac 1954). We apply niche and occupancy modeling to inform on the range and habitat use of this semi-aquatic species. We estimate that its global range [extent of occurrence (EOO)] is 14,725 km2. Using occupancy modeling, we show that mining has a direct impact on the occurrence of this species. We also provide preliminary observations of its movements through radio-tracking. Using maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling, we identify the North Lorma National Forest and the Wonegizi range (northern Liberia) that appear suitable for this species, but where it has not yet been recorded. We suggest that the Nimba otter-shrew has a global distribution centered on the Mount Nimba region, straddling the borders of Liberia, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire, and that it requires urgent conservation attention to ensure its long-term persistence. Finally, we provide evidence to support an uplisting of its IUCN Red List conservation status to Vulnerable.",

The effects of such disturbance are poorly known for African insectivorous bats. We studied the activity patterns of insectivorous bats in a tropical African forest at Kibale National Park, Uganda, using an Anabat bat detector. The echolocation calls of the vespertilionid bat Neoromicia nana were the most frequently detected. This species was most active in the ﬁrst 5 h after sunset with activity declining rapidly after midnight until sampling ﬁnished at 01:00 h. There was no difference in activity of N. nana levels between logged or undisturbed forest; however, this species exhibited higher levels of activity along the wide tracks running through the two forests than either 30 m off these tracks or along the narrow forest trails. The wing morphology and echolocation call of N. nana may be constraining it to ﬂying in uncluttered space on the edge of the forest, penetrating mostly along wider tracks and roads. Further research (in particular radio-telemetry) is required to test and validate these data.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Pipistrelloid bats are among the most poorly known bats in Africa, a status no doubt exacerbated by their small size, drab brown fur and general similarity in external morphology. The systematic relationships of these bats have been a matter of debate for decades, and despite some recent molecular studies, much confusion remains. Adding to the confusion has been the recent discovery of numerous new species. Using two mitochondrial genes, we present a phylogeny for this group that supports the existence of three main clades in Africa: Pipistrellus, Neoromicia and the recently described Parahypsugo. However, the basal branches of the tree are poorly supported. Using an integrative taxonomic approach, we describe a new species of Pipistrellus sp. nov. from West Africa, which has been cited as Pipistrellus cf. grandidieri in the literature. We demonstrate that it is not closely related to Pipistrellus grandidieri from East Africa, but instead is sister to Pipistrellus hesperidus. Furthermore, the species Pi. grandidieri appears to be embedded in the newly described genus Parahypsugo, and is therefore better placed in that genus than in Pipistrellus. This has important taxonomic implications, because a new subgenus (Afropipistrellus) described for Pi. grandidieri predates Parahypsugo and should therefore be used for the entire “Parahypsugo” clade. The Upper Guinea rainforest zone, and particularly the upland areas in the south-eastern Guinea—northern Liberia border region may represent a global hotspot for pipistrelloid bats and should receive increased conservation focus as a result.",

Search, approach and terminal phases were identified in the foraging activity of the species. During search phase, P. macleayii emitted calls consisting of a short CF component followed by a downward FM sweep (sCF-FM), typical of the small Pteronotus species. In addition, FM-sCF calls were recorded. In search flight some sequences consisted only of sCF-FM calls while others consisted only of FM-sCF calls. Most sequences, however, combined both call designs. Based on this and previous studies we suggest that sCF-FM and FM-sCF calls will characterize the vocal repertoire of each of the small Pteronotus species. We discuss the relevance of our results for acoustic identification of P. macleayii and the other small Pteronotus in the field.",

During hunting, N. cubanus search for insects emitting cries that sweep from 80 to 40 kHz in 4 to 12 ms. Search call characteristics correlate with the clutter structure of the hunting areas. Bats hunting in an uncluttered space broadcast longer and narrower signals, while bats hunting in cluttered space broadcast shorter and broadband signals. Longer calls were emitted with longer intervals while the duty cycle was kept below 15 % during search and approach phases. The call's minimal frequency remained about 43 kHz showing variation coefficients of less than 3%. As a consequence, bandwidth correlates positively with the maximal frequency. Calls emitted by different sympatric individuals are accurately classified by sender using a discriminant function analysis, suggesting vocal signatures in N. cubanus. The statistical analysis of several passes of calls broadcast during the hunting activity of a single individual, demonstrates a high intra-individual plasticity in vocal signatures and points to a dynamic system.",

Eleven extant and one extinct species were examined using geometric and linear morphometric analyses to evaluate morphological differences among species. Based on 19 landmarks located in the ventral side of the cranium, 29 size-standardized linear measurements were calculated and used for statistical multivariate analyses. Discriminant Function Analysis showed major interspecific differences in shape between A. anthonyi and A. concolor with respect to the remaining extant species of Artibeus. These two species are described as morphologically unique morphotypes with a broader rostrum, enlarged squamosal region, and wider basicranium. Specifically, a broader premaxilla is the character that better discriminates A. anthonyi from all other species, whereas a broader squamosal region (particularly the deep mandibular fossa, and elongated squamosal) and wider braincase are the main characters differentiating A. concolor. All other species of the genus overlap to varying extents in their morphology showing high shape similarities. The least variant shape features include the pterygoid fossa, the glenoid (mandibular) fossa, the maxillae, and the occipital region; these regions in all cases contribute to mechanical aspects of jaw function and bite. The fact that the least variant aspects of skull shape all involve feeding is consistent with the hypothesis that selection has favored a specific diet-associated morphology rather than divergence or character displacement in Artibeus.",

            "abstractNote": "Autumnal foraging behaviour and habitat use by Tadarida teniotis were studied in Southern Portugal, using seventeen radio-marked individuals, followed over multiple nights from fixed and mobile stations. Tadarida teniotis proved to be a late emerger, leaving the roost about one hour after sunset and, in contrast to most insectivorous bat species, only had one foraging bout. These bouts were very long, lasting an average of 6 hours and 39 minutes. Bout duration was unrelated to climatic conditions and so probably determined by foraging success. In the early evening almost all bats were foraging, but this activity declined steadily through the night. They kept flying even during fairly cold nights, but did not leave the roost on the coldest nights, in which they probably remained in torpor. As predicted by its body mass and wing morphology, T. teniotis was found to be a strong flyer, reaching speeds of over 50 km/h, and flying for up to 10 hours without resting periods. The observed speeds were 2.5 times higher than the predicted maximum range speed, which may be possible due to peculiar adaptations to high-speed flight. On most nights bats flew straight to a previously identified feeding site, but on a few they made slower indirect flights, suggesting a search for profitable foraging areas. Upon arriving to a feeding site most bats remained there for the rest of the foraging trip. The median size of these sites was just over 100 ha. Several tracked bats used the same feeding area simultaneously. The range of the colony had a radius of over 30 km, but most feeding sites were concentrated in a mountainous region located about 5 km north of the roost. The studied bats foraged preferentially over forested areas, particularly pine and cork oak woodlands. They used both alluvial plains and the valleys of a mountainous area, but not its ridges. Our observations support the hypothesis that T. teniotis is an opportunistic forager, depending on temporary concentrations of prey, such as insect swarms.",

(male unknown) from M. manavi, both in the Special Reserve of Ankarana. These materials are compared to the 22 Litomosa species, including two Indian species originally placed in the genus Litomosoides, L. fotedari (Gupta & Trivedi, 1989) n. comb. and L. tewarii (Gupta & Trivedi, 1989) n. comb., and the new taxon L. seurati n. sp. (= L. beaucournui Bain, 1966 pro parte), type-host Rhinolophus ferrum-equinum, Algeria, distinguished by the narrow area rugosa and the female caudal extremity with two conspicuous points, instead of several small ones. The Malagasy material belongs to a group of species close to the type, L. filaria, which have a male area rugosa composed of cuticular bosses and microfilariae folded within the sheath, and which are parasitic in Vespertilionidae, Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae from Africa and Europe. The two Malagasy species resemble L. seurati n. sp., L. beshkovi Jancev, 1971, L. chiropterum Ortlepp, 1932, L. adami Petit, 1980 and L. ottavianii Lagrange et Bettini, 1948, with the enlarged third segment of the buccal capsule. L. goodmani n. sp. is distinct with its small size and female caudal extremity with a single point, which is suppressed in old mature worms; the females of Litomosa sp. have two conical points. Relationships among Litomosa species appear to be dependent upon both the chiropteran host groups and the geographical region.",

Monthly sampling took place at Piedra Honda cave, from November 1991 to October 1993. A total of 1,590 individuals was captured with harp traps. Sex-ratio of the sample was strongly female biased (Chi-square = 217.47, p « 0.001). Females showed a pregnancy peak in May, and a lactation peak in June. The highest frequencies of juveniles were observed in July. Results indicate that Piedra Honda cave is both a diurnal and a maternity roost, L. curasoae has a seasonally monoestrous reproductive pattern, its social structure exhibited few changes throughout the year, and females are the predominant sex in this cave. The reproductive pattern of L. curasoae does not show a latitudinal effect; for Venezuelan populations it is nearly the same as in southern Arizona populations, despite the variation of temperatureand rainfall patterns registered between the two places.",

            "abstractNote": "Pipistrelloid bats are among the most poorly known bats in Africa, a status no doubt exacerbated by their small size, drab brown fur and general similarity in external morphology. The systematic relationships of these bats have been a matter of debate for decades, and despite some recent molecular studies, much confusion remains. Adding to the confusion has been the recent discovery of numerous new species. Using two mitochondrial genes, we present a phylogeny for this group that supports the existence of three main clades in Africa: Pipistrellus, Neoromicia and the recently described Parahypsugo. However, the basal branches of the tree are poorly supported. Using an integrative taxonomic approach, we describe a new species of Pipistrellus sp. nov. from West Africa, which has been cited as Pipistrellus cf. grandidieri in the literature. We demonstrate that it is not closely related to Pipistrellus grandidieri from East Africa, but instead is sister to Pipistrellus hesperidus. Furthermore, the species Pi. grandidieri appears to be embedded in the newly described genus Parahypsugo, and is therefore better placed in that genus than in Pipistrellus. This has important taxonomic implications, because a new subgenus (Afropipistrellus) described for Pi. grandidieri predates Parahypsugo and should therefore be used for the entire “Parahypsugo” clade. The Upper Guinea rainforest zone, and particularly the upland areas in the south-eastern Guinea—northern Liberia border region may represent a global hotspot for pipistrelloid bats and should receive increased conservation focus as a result.",

The species H. lamottei has been misdiagnosed previously, partly as a result of errors in published measurements. This taxon is currently known only from high-altitude grasslands in northern (Guinean) Mount Nimba. Cytochrome b sequences and echolocation calls of this species, as well as for H. marisae, are presented for the first time. Also, at least two different species groups, previously lumped in H. ruber, co-exist syntopically here. Mount Nimba apparently represents a diversity hotspot for species of Hipposideros in West Africa, and as a result may be an important site for their conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "Roost selection by insectivorous bats in temperate regions is presumably influenced by roost microclimates in relation to thermoregulatory strategies, but few studies have included temperature measurements in habitat selection models. Rocky landscape features are an important source of roosts that provide both shelter from predators and beneficial microclimates for bats. Most information about rock-roosting bats has been derived from western North America. We studied microhabitat selection by the Eastern Small-footed Myotis (Myotis leibii) on natural talus slopes and human-made stone structures in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia and New Hampshire, relative to thermal and structural characteristics of rock crevices. Roosts were located with a combination of radiotelemetry and randomized visual surveys. Roost-switching behavior and structural characteristics of roosts did not appear to be influenced by the methods we used to locate roosts. Compared to random crevices, both sexes selected crevices with narrow openings, likely to provide protection from predators. Reproductive females also selected rocks that were larger and more thermally stable than random crevices, whereas males selected crevices that were structurally similar to random crevices but warmed more during the day. Rock size and other structural characteristics influenced temperatures of roosts and random crevices alike by inhibiting excessive daytime heating and nighttime cooling. Because large rocks were important for reproductive females, and talus slopes with large rocks could be limited, we recommend including rock size as a variable in landscape scale habitat assessments for Eastern Small-footed Myotis. Protecting or managing for habitat features with large rocks that receive high solar exposure could benefit Eastern Small-footed Myotis, and perhaps other rock-roosting species.",

We examined diet of the North American big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) using published works and our own data from New England to better understand intraspecific dietary variation, and to test whether diet corresponded with climate (an indicator of availability of prey) and species richness of bat communities (a measure of potential interspecific competition). Diet of both species of bat varied with climate in a manner that generally corresponded with longitude. E. fuscus increased use of moths in regions with cool arid summers (western North America), whereas both species of bat consumed more beetles in moister summer climates associated with eastern North America. Additionally, E. fuscus consumed fewer beetles and more moths and true flies in more diverse bat communities. However, correlation between richness of bat communities and mean monthly precipitation limits interpretation of whether richness of bat communities influenced foraging beyond effects of climate alone. Results suggest diet is influenced indirectly by environmental factors that limit availability of prey. Further examination of these and other factors related to intraspecific dietary variation in insectivorous bats is warranted and likely to yield valuable ecological insight.",

Location: North, Central and South America, Greater and Lesser Antilles. Methods: We analysed morphometric, genetic and environmental data from the entire distribution of T. brasiliensis. Individuals were genotyped at nine nuclear loci, and clustering analyses were used to detect genetic groups and test correlations between genetic, geographical, and environmental distances. Museum specimens were photographed and 111 two-dimensional landmarks were digitized per individual. Multivariate analyses were applied to explore whether factors such as sex, genetic group, subspecies, biogeographical regions, latitude, longitude and/or environment contribute to the morphometric variation of this species. We also applied a novel approach based on trend surface analyses and model selection to compare models of spatial and environmental dependence and to predict size, shape, and allometry-free variation across the Americas.",

            "abstractNote": "Genetic exchange and hybridization appear common among the western long-eared bats from North America. Multiple sources of evidence indicate that lineages within this group are evolving independently, despite genetic exchange. However, evidence of gene ﬂow raises questions about the species-level status of some lineages. C.L. Lausen et al. (2019. Can. J. Zool. 97(3): 267–279) proposed that Myotis evotis (H. Allen, 1864) (long-eared myotis) and Myotis keenii (Merriam, 1895) (Keen’s myotis) are one species, not two. This conclusion is based on analyses of cytochrome b and microsatellite data suggesting gene ﬂow between these taxa. Microsatellites are not reliable markers for identifying species because homoplasy can be a major confounding factor, which appears to be true in this case. We reanalyzed the dataset of C.L. Lausen et al. (2019) and show that it is not reliable to distinguish between gene ﬂow or homoplasy, and that these data do not support the conclusion that M. evotis and M. keenii represent a single species. Previous morphological and genomic studies indicate that these are separate species despite previous genetic exchange between them. Failing to recognize that gene ﬂow can occur between independently evolving lineages is counterproductive for conservation because it can lead to neglect of important independent lineages, and likewise failing to use proper tools to delimit species is counterproductive to efforts to quantify biodiversity and design conservation strategies.",
