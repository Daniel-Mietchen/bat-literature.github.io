However, little is known about the laboratory reference intervals (RIs) of bats, especially Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus). The aim of this study was to obtain haematological, biochemical and electrophoretic RIs from captive fruit bats. Blood was collected from 21 R. aegyptiacus (11 females and 10 males). Complete blood cell count was performed using an impedance cell counter followed by the morphologic analysis of blood smears. Clinical biochemistry was performed with an automated spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out with an automated instrument. Reference intervals were determined using the Reference Value Advisor V2.1, following the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology guidelines. Possible differences related to sex or sexual maturity were also investigated. The RIs for most of the analytes investigated were similar to those of other types of bats and other mammalian species. Haematology revealed mild polychromasia and slightly lower haematocrit, haemoglobin, leukocyte and lymphocyte counts compared to other bats. Glucose levels varied possibly due to stress, the anaesthetic protocol and fasting time. Creatine kinase was higher, while triglycerides were lower compared with domestic mammals and other bats. No sexor age-related differences were found. Serum protein electrophoresis showed five fractions (albumin, a-, b1-, b2- and c-globulins). The values recorded in this study could be helpful as a reference biological dataset to monitor the health status of wild and captive R. aegyptiacus and, possibly, of other Chiroptera.",

            "abstractNote": "The Lecythidaceae comprise a pantropical family best known for the edible seeds of the Brazil nut (\n              Bertholletia excelsa\n              ) and the cannon‐ball tree (\n              Couroupita guianensis\n              ), which is planted as a botanical curiosity in subtropical and tropical gardens. In addition, species of the family are often among the most common in neotropical forests, especially in the Amazon Basin. The Brazil nut family is diverse and abundant in the Amazon and is considered to be an indicator of undisturbed or scarcely disturbed lowland forests; thus, what is learned about its evolution, ecology, and biogeography may suggest similar patterns for other Amazonian tree families. We used combined data sets derived from the\n              ndhF\n              and\n              trnL‐F\n              genes to elucidate relationships of genera in both the Old and New Worlds that have been associated with Lecythidaceae. Our molecular tree agrees with the recognition of Napoleonaeaceae and Scytopetalaceae. Within the Lecythidaceae, there is molecular support for recognizing three subfamilies: Foetidioideae, Planchonioideae, and Lecythidoideae. We then focused on genera of the Lecythidoideae and found support for recognizing\n              Allantoma\n              (when the actinomorphic‐flowered species of\n              Cariniana\n              are included in it),\n              Grias, Gustavia\n              ,\n              Corythophora, Couratari\n              , and\n              Couroupita\n              , but conclude that\n              Cariniana\n              ,\n              Lecythis\n              , and\n              Eschweilera\n              are not monoyphyletic. Because the position of the monotypic\n              Bertholletia excelsa\n              in relation to the other zygomorphic‐flowered genera is not resolved, we are not able to comment on its generic relationships.",

Therefore, we investigated home-range size in Nycticeius humeralis (Evening Bats) by radiotracking 14 individuals (5 females and 9 males) for 7–11 nights each in a pine-dominated landscape in southwestern Georgia during June–August 2008. We generated 95% and 50% adaptive kernel (AK) home ranges and 95% minimum convex polygon (MCP) home ranges and found that mean 95% AK home-range size was 155.7 ± 38.3 ha, with individual values ranging from 36.9 ha to 565.9 ha. Mean 95% MCP home-range size was 118.5 ± 29.5 ha, with individual values ranging from 33.6–456.2 ha. Home-range sizes did not differ between males and females (P = 0.35), but were larger in August (P = 0.004) than in June and July. Evening Bat home-range sizes on our study area were similar to previously documented home ranges in forested and rural landscapes. Although Evening Bats may be habitat generalists relative to foraging activity at the scale of habitat patches, multiple core areas of activity indicate selection within this scale that may be related to prey and roost availability.",

This is especially true for the endangered Eumops floridanus (Florida bonneted bat). Scant knowledge of the species’ natural history and ecological interactions has precluded the development of effective conservation strategies. We investigated several aspects of the social organization of E. floridanus roosting in bat houses in southwest Florida: group size, group composition, group stability, and seasonality of reproduction. Our findings suggest the species has characteristics more common to tropical bat species than temperate ones. The average roost size was 10 individuals, with colonies in a harem social structure all three times in the year they were assessed. Adults were much more likely than sub-adults to be recaptured at the same roosts during subsequent capture sessions. We suggest that the availability and distribution of roosts may alter the social structure of these bats and ultimately limit local populations. We did not find evidence of a distinct seasonal birthing period matching that of other temperate bat species. Results suggests the species is aseasonally polyestrous, making non-volant E. floridanus vulnerable to disturbance across a larger portion of the year than other bat species in the US.",

However, there has been little previous consideration of the extent and impact of predation of bats by cats, or of whether specific characteristics make certain species of bats particularly vulnerable to predation by cats.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We reviewed the impact of cats on bats, based on a collation of scientific literature and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List database. Our aim was to produce a synthesis of the extent to which cats prey upon and threaten bats. We also collated available data on cat diet, which provide information on predation rates of bats by cats.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Few studies (\n                    n\n                     = 44) have identified bat species preyed upon or threatened by cats, with a disproportionate number of studies from islands. In these studies, 86 bat species (about 7% of the global extant tally) are reported as preyed upon or threatened by cats, and about one quarter of these species are listed as Near Threatened or threatened (IUCN categories Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable). In IUCN Red List assessments, cats are more frequently mentioned as a threat to threatened or Near Threatened bat species than to non‐threatened species (IUCN category Least Concern).\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    In studies reporting on the incidence of bats in cat dietary samples (scats, stomachs and guts), the frequency of occurrence of bats in samples averaged 0.7 ± 2.1% (mean ± standard deviation;\n                    n\n                     = 102). Many studies had sample sizes that were too small to be likely to detect bats.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  All forms of cat are reported to kill bats, and such predation has been reported in all major terrestrial habitats. We conclude that predation by cats is an under‐appreciated threat to the world’s bat species.\n                \n              \n            \n          , \n            RESUMÉ EN FRANÇAIS\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    Les chats\n                    Felis catus\n                    , sous toutes leurs formes (domestiques, errants ou harets), ont été identifiés comme une menace mondiale majeure pour la biodiversité, en particulier pour les oiseaux et les petits mammifères. Cependant, l'ampleur de ce phénomène et l'impact de la prédation exercée sur les chauves‐souris par les chats n'ont guère été pris en compte jusqu'à présent. En particulier la question de savoir si des caractéristiques spécifiques rendent certaines espèces de chauves‐souris particulièrement vulnérables à la prédation par les chats reste en suspens.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Nous avons examiné l'impact des chats sur les chauves‐souris, en croisant les informations issues de la littérature scientifique sur le sujet et celles disponibles dans la base de données de la liste rouge de l'Union Internationale pour la Conservation de la Nature (UICN). Notre objectif était de produire une synthèse mondiale visant à estimer dans quelle mesure les chats s'attaquent aux chauves‐souris et constituent une menace. Nous avons également rassemblé les données disponibles sur le régime alimentaire des chats, qui fournissent des informations sur les taux de prédation des chauves‐souris par les chats.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Peu d'études (\n                    n\n                     = 44) ont permis d’identifier des espèces de chauves‐souris prédatées et/ou menacées par les chats, un nombre disproportionné d’entre elles concernent les écosystèmes insulaires. Ces études ont permis d’identifier 86 espèces de chauves‐souris (environ 7 % des espèces mondiales) représentant des proies ou étant directement menacées par les chats ; environ un quart de ces espèces sont classées comme \"quasi menacées\" ou \"menacées\" (catégories de l'UICN : En danger critique d'extinction, En danger ou Vulnérable). Dans les évaluations de la Liste rouge de l'UICN, les chats sont plus fréquemment mentionnés comme une menace pour les espèces de chauves‐souris menacées ou quasi menacées que pour les espèces non menacées (catégorie de l'UICN \"Préoccupation mineure\").\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Dans les études analysant le régime alimentaire des chats (excréments, estomacs et tubes digestifs) la fréquence d'occurrence des chauves‐souris dans les échantillons était en moyenne de 0.7 ± 2.1 % (moyenne ± écart‐type ;\n                    n\n                     = 102). Dans de nombreux travaux, la taille des échantillons était trop petite pour permettre de détecter la prédation sur des chauves‐souris.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Toutes les formes de chats s'attaquent aux chauves‐souris, et cette prédation a été signalée dans tous les principaux habitats terrestres. En conclusion, la prédation des chauves‐souris par les chats apparait être une menace sous‐estimée au niveau mondial.",

It is endemic to Jamaica and formerly known only from Stony Hill Cave, where there are an estimated c.  individuals. Previously declared extinct twice, its rediscovery in  at Stony Hill Cave marked new hope for the conservation of this important species. Although little is known about its ecology, the species is presumed to be a cave-obligate rooster and to rely exclusively on so-called hot caves, which are defined by high ambient temperatures and low air quality. In March–April , we surveyed bats at seven caves throughout Jamaica. At two of these, Green Grotto Caves, St. Ann, and Rock Spring Caverns, St. Mary, we captured both male and pregnant female P. aphylla. At Green Grotto Caves, we captured  P. aphylla, and  at Rock Spring Caverns. We believe Rock Spring Caverns to be one of the largest known roosts of P. aphylla. Neither of these sites are hot caves as both are moderated by flowing water, although warmer chambers may be more important to this bat than to other species. Further monitoring of these populations and continued exploration of other potential roosts are vital for the protection of this species.",

            "abstractNote": "The Bonin flying fox (Pteropus pselaphon) is endemic to the Ogasawara Islands, a collection of small oceanic islands in the Pacific Ocean. It inhabits only five islands: Chichi-jima, Haha-jima, Kita-iwo, Iwo, and Minami-iwo (arranged from north to south). Hahajima and Kita-iwo, the most widely spaced islands, are separated by a distance of about 160 km. The islands have different histories in the modern era with respect to human activity. At present, P. pselaphon population sizes exceed 100 on Chichi-jima and Minamiiwo, but the species is rare on the other three islands. Loss of genetic diversity is of concern because of the small population sizes. We obtained samples from three of the five islands — Chichi-jima, Kita-iwo, and Minami-iwo — and investigated species genetic diversity and genetic structure based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and microsatellite markers. Different mtDNA haplotypes were found in each island population. Based on the mtDNA sequence data, P. pselaphon displayed a cryptic genealogy, as haplotypes on each island did not cluster together. The microsatellite marker data, however, revealed a clear genetic structure among the island populations, suggesting the absence of recent inter-island gene flow. Based on these results, we propose that the individual island populations are not evolutionarily significant units, but should be conserved collectively as a single management unit.",

Tumor types identiﬁed include ﬁbrosarcoma, cutaneous lymphoma, benign focal bronchioloalveolar neoplasm, anaplastic sarcoma, and sebaceous epithelioma. To the author’s knowledge, aside from a recent report of focal brochioloalveolar adenoma,8 these tumor types have not previously been described in the Rousettus species, nor in chiropterans in general. Based upon these ﬁndings and other recent publications regarding R. aegyptiacus, neoplasia does appear to be a signiﬁcant cause of morbidity and mortality in captive members of this megachiropterid species.",

            "abstractNote": "Exposure to pesticides may increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxidation of cell membrane lipids and proteins. Although fruit bats are potentially exposed to pesticides during their entire lifespan, the impacts of this exposure are still poorly investigated. We examined the effects of low, commercially recommended concentrations (0, 1.05 and 2.1 g/l) of an organochlorine insecticide endosulfan (EDS) formulation on oxidative responses in the liver and kidneys of Neotropical fruit bats (Artibeus lituratus), as well as possible liver morphological alterations following a 35-day oral exposure. Superoxide dismutase activity was signiﬁcantly decreased upon exposure to 1.05 g/l of EDS in the liver and kidneys, catalase was decreased in the liver of 2.1 g/l EDS-exposed bats, while glutathione Stransferase was increased in the liver of 2.1 g/l EDS-exposed bats. Protein carbonyls increased following the exposure to the highest EDS dose tested. Endosulfan-induced morphological alterations in the liver included cell degeneration and cell death, with apparent cytoplasm lipid accumulation (steatosis) and pyknotic nuclei, karyolysis and deposit of collagen ﬁbres. Our ﬁndings suggest that exposure to low concentrations of EDS induced a certain extent of oxidative damage in fruit bats, which may have led to liver morphological alterations.",

However, for individuals occupying spatially limited structures, such as tree cavities, group formation may inﬂuence—and be inﬂuenced by—the range of structures available for use. This may be especially true of bats, which often form maternity groups that regularly change in size. We examined colonies of tree-roosting little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus (LeConte, 1831)) in northern Alberta to address two questions: (1) is group size associated with patterns of roost use, in particular the use of large-diameter trees, and (2) does group size change during reproduction and correspond to changes in roost use? We located roosts over 2 years using radiotelemetry and conducted exit counts at a subset of these roosts. Larger diameter trees had larger and more variable group sizes. Roost-tree diameter peaked near the start of parturition, the time when bats formed the largest groups. We suggest that large groups are especially beneﬁcial at this time due to the thermoregulatory beneﬁts to small, unfurred pups. Our results indicate that roost use and group size are interrelated and that large-diameter trees may be especially beneﬁcial by supporting a wider range of group sizes.",

This represents only the 7th bat species known from the state and its 1st new bat in .40 y. All known specimens of the Yuma Myotis were collected in the early 1990s. Reasons why this species escaped detection until now are discussed and include its close morphological resemblence to the more common and widespread Little Brown Myotis (Myotis lucifugus), the general inaccessibility of much of Southeast Alaska, and a historical paucity of field and specimen-based studies of bats from this region. The presence of the Yuma Myotis in Alaska, while not surprising, suggests that we still have much to learn about the basic biology, ecology, and biogeography of this and other bat species in and around Alaska. Such information is critical if we are to monitor the effects of climate change and other anthropogenic factors on organisms at the limits of their geographic distributions.",

Historic distribution records of this species in the Pacific Northwest region of North America include southern Oregon and southern Idaho, but not British Columbia. During 2014–2016 we conducted bat acoustic surveys in Canada on Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, sampling 1342 detector-nights. We recorded multiple bat-call sequences during 2016 showing pulse and sequence attributes consistent with those of the Brazilian Free-tailed Bat, and we recorded 2 such call sequences in 2015. Calls were detected from May until September, suggesting summer residency by adults, rather than stray post-natal dispersals from the south. The Brazilian Free-tailed Bat is a fast long-distance flyer, and acoustic surveys outside of its historic range may benefit from surveillance for this species.",

NJ analysis shows polyphyly of Insectivora and Chiroptera. Assuming that each of Primates, Ferungulata, Chiroptera, Insectivora and Rodentia is a monophyletic group, ML analysis suggests that Chiroptera is a sister group of Insectivora and that Ferungulata is the closest outgroup to the (Insectivora and Chiroptera) clade.",

This study provides new chronological data for the understanding of the post-Pleistocene survival of some of Cuba’s rarest extinct bats, and a post-Columbian record of Desmodus rotundus. Remains were excavated from a superficial, mound-like deposit with no dicernible stratigraphy. The bones of 13 bat species, one owl, one rail, a small colubrid snake, one frog, a nesophontid shrew, a rat, a mouse, and two capromyid rodents were extracted from the assemblage. The chiropterans were the most abundant and included the extinct taxa Desmodus rotundus and Artibeus anthonyi, the rare Lasiurus insularis, and the endangered Natalus primus. The mixed assemblage originated from accumulated owl pellets and carcasses of roosting bats. Three Artibeus jamaicensis scapulae from the same level and bone coloration as the Desmodus material yielded a modern radiocarbon content indicative of post-thermonuclear testing era (114.9 % ± 0.6 pMC), indicating an essentially modern age for the specimens. Material from the deepest level, however, is interpreted to be older due to factors such as a probable slow rate of accumulation, difference in bone coloration, and mineralization. These results support the survival of some extinct bat species well into the late Holocene of Cuba.",

All loci were highly polymorphic, with 17–20 alleles identified per locus. Observed heterozygosity levels (0.66–0.82) are lower than expected due to homozygote excess, probably caused by pooling of populations, resulting in population substructuring. All five polymorphic loci were also successfully amplified in the closely related M. fraterculus. Two pairs of primers additionally amplified polymorphic microsatellites in Chaerophon sp.",

Far less is known about Msum and metabolic expansibility [ME, the ratio of Msum to basal metabolic rate (BMR)] in bats compared with many other endotherm taxa. We measured BMR and Msum during winter and summer in captive and wild populations of a pteropodid from the southern subtropics, Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) in Pretoria, South Africa. The Msum of fruit bats ranged from 5.178±0.611 W (captive, summer) to 6.006±0.890 W (captive, winter), and did not vary significantly between seasons. In contrast, BMR decreased by 17–25% in winter. The combination of seasonally stable Msum but flexible BMR resulted in ME being significantly higher in winter than in summer, ranging from 7.24±1.49 (wild, summer) to 13.11±2.14 (captive, winter). The latter value is well above the typical mammalian range. Moreover, both Msum and ME were significantly higher in captive bats than in wild individuals; we speculate this represents a phenotypic response to a reduction in exerciseassociated heat production while in captivity. Our data for E. wahlbergi, combined with those currently available for other chiropterans, reveal that Msum in bats is highly variable compared with allometrically expected values for other mammals.",

We also performed two manipulative experiments evaluating (a) the seed production efficiency of different crossing systems (selfing, cross‐pollination, apomixis, and control), and (b) the effect of different pollinators (diurnal exposure to pollinators, nocturnal exposure, exclusion, and control) on the seeds produced. Flowering occurred from early May to late July and had a mean duration of 29 days in the individual rosettes. The flowers were protandrous; anthesis occurred in the afternoon of the third day after floral opening, and the pistils matured in the afternoon of the fifth day. The stigmas remained receptive from dusk to the following morning. Pollination was mostly allogamous.

Scapes exposed to moths but excluded to bats yielded ∼50% fewer fruits than those exposed to both pollinator groups. Flowers exposed to the bat species\n              Leptonycteris curasoae\n              showed similar fruiting success to those exposed to\n              Choeronycteris mexicana\n              and to those exposed to the whole nocturnal visitor guild. However, the fruits originated from flowers pollinated by\n              Leptonycteris curasoae\n              yielded significantly more seed than those exposed to\n              Choeronycteris mexicana\n              or to the whole pollinator guild. It is concluded that\n              Agave macroacantha\n              is extremely dependent on nocturnal pollinators for its reproductive success and that bats are especially important for successful pollination. Some of these pollinators are migratory and have been reported to be steadily declining. A continuing decline in the populations of pollinators may impede the successful sexual reproduction of the plant host and may put the long‐term survival of this agave species under risk.",

            "abstractNote": "1.\n              Ecomorphological studies have described local bat communities as densely‐packed species assemblages arising from non‐deterministic processes. Together with the observation that insectivorous bats readily exploit patchy, often unlimited trophic resources, this has even led to the claim that partitioning of niche space may be absent. However, the paucity of data on resource exploitation\n              per se\n              among bat guilds rarely allows these assertions to be verified. In particular, the mechanisms allowing the co‐existence of similar species have proved difficult to determine.\n            \n            \n              2.\n              As a subset of an insectivorous guild, the vespertilionid bats\n              Myotis myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              offer an opportunity to examine this question. Genetically closely‐related, they are morphologically almost identical. Yet, as established by faecal analysis, they exploit distinct trophic niches, preying upon ground‐ and grass‐dwelling prey taxa, respectively. The distinct habitat requirements of their basic prey suggest that ecological segregation may stem primarily from a differential allocation of foraging space.\n            \n            \n              3.\n              The present study tests the hypothesis that sympatric\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              segregate spatially to an extent which prevents competitive interference. I performed radio‐tracking on Swiss sympatric populations. Using multivariate analyses and randomized contingency table procedures, I looked for (i) habitat overlap and overall inter‐specific differences in habitat choice, and (ii) the habitat preferences exhibited by individuals when foraging within their own feeding areas.\n            \n            \n              4.\n              Primary foraging habitats were largely species‐specific. Not only were they spatially segregated, but they also differed structurally. All habitats selected by\n              M. myotis\n              offered a high accessibility to ground‐dwelling prey (freshly‐cut meadows, mown grass in intensively cultivated orchards, forests without undergrowth), whereas grassland predominated in all habitats of\n              M. blythii\n              (steppe, unmown meadows, pastures). This corroborates the predictions drawn from dietary niches.\n            \n            \n              5.\n              This study shows that refined mechanisms of resource partitioning, not predictable by the study of morphological characters or echolocation alone, may still account for the organization of parts of insectivorous bat guilds. It also supports the view that habitat selection may prove to be a major mode of resource allocation amongst similar insectivorous bats, particularly for species exploiting limited food supplies.",

Does this differ entiation arise purely from the use of distinct feeding habitats or, alternatively, do the species exert active prey selection within their feeding habitats? To answer this question, we compared the distribution of prey in the species’ diets with that in their respective feeding habitats, looking for discrepancies with respect to taxon and/or size. Although the general correlation is fairly good, some local discrepancies arise: (1) M. myotis underexploited small prey items (&lt;0.05 g dry weight), and (2) M. blythii overexploited cockchafers (Melolontha melolontha) and underexploited ground arthropods. We argue, however, that these discrepancies do not result from active prey selection, but from (1) the low availability of some categories of prey (due to either low detectability or low accessibility) and (2) the opportunistic exploitation of atypical feeding habitats. In fact, our results do not falsify the parsimonious hypothesis that the two species exert no active prey selection within their feeding habitats. We are furthermore not aware of any paper from the bat literature that provides definite support for active prey selection among insectivorous vespertilionids. Their echolocation system may actually preclude it.",

We related a pattern of intraspeciﬁc call differences to the size of nasal chambers (estimated from radiographs of museum specimens), expecting chamber dimensions to be functionally coupled with the sound source. Such a relationship is potentially informative in the context of competing hypotheses that account for call frequency differences. Allopatry has been a precursor to differences in echolocation call frequency between isolated populations of the Australian endemic orange leaf-nosed bat (Rhinonicteris aurantia (Gray, 1845); Pilbara isolate: 120.99 6 1.91 kHz; compared with Kimberley region: 114.65 6 1.98 kHz and Northern Territory: 114.62 6 2.10 kHz). Correlations with morphological features not directly involved in signal production or modiﬁcation were either moderate (nose-leaf width) or absent (forearm length). Overall nasal volume was shown to be relatively smaller in the Pilbara population, which had higher average call frequency. This relationship was expected given the suggested function of nasal chambers in impedance matching. The ﬁnding is signiﬁcant because nasal chamber size was the only character observed to vary in a species that was otherwise conserved morphologically, suggesting adaptation and not a simple scaling relationship with body size that might be more indicative of drift. We consider that the combination of patterns from echolocation call frequency and associated morphological features, as well as neutral DNA markers, provide adequate support for recognition of the separate populations of R. aurantia for conservation, according to more recent concepts that consider ecological as well as genetic characters when allocating groups to evolutionarily signiﬁcant units.",

Our understanding of susceptible hosts and prevalence of infection of Hepatocystis remains fragmented. Non-invasive sampling of bat assemblages in representative habitats critically contribute to haemosporidian parasite distribution maps. Here, we report on a survey of Hepatocystis parasite infections in bats undertaken over two consecutive years in a protected area in Nigeria, where prevalence and diversity of bat-infecting haemosporidian parasites have not been studied. Microscopic examination of blood films in combination with PCR detection and sequencing revealed Hepatocystis infections with prevalences of 25% and 42% in the closely related epauletted fruit bats Epomophorus sp. and Micropteropus pusillus. For the first time, mature Hepatocystis gametocytes were identified in one Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). This novel host record was confirmed by parasite and host genotyping and suggests that Hepatocystis parasites have a broader host distribution in African fruit bats than currently known.",

            "abstractNote": "Breeding of the threatened long-tailed bat Chalinolobus tuberculatus was studied over seven summers, 1993±2000, in temperate rainforest, Fiordland, New Zealand. Reproductive history of 789 marked bats from three social groups was investigated. Seventy per cent of births occurred over a 10-day period in midDecember. Young began ¯ying at 5±6 weeks and nipples of reproductive females were regressing 2 weeks later. Sex ratio at birth was equal. Lactation coincided with highest annual air temperatures and peak abundance of ¯ying invertebrates. Date of ®rst birth varied by 4 days annually, but date of ®rst ¯ight varied by 17 days. Males had distended cauda epididymides at 1 year old (mean  se = 1.63  0.16 years) and epididymal distension peaked in early autumn. Females ®rst gave birth at 2±3 years of age (2.33  0.08 years). The short, highly synchronous breeding season, birth of single young, early mating in autumn, and late age of female sexual maturity compared to similar-sized vespertilionids, may be related to low food availability and unpredictable cold-temperate weather conditions. Annual productivity did not differ among groups but probability of survival of juveniles varied from 0.26 to 0.88 and was inversely proportional to size of natal group. Variability in breeding parameters was unrelated to climate or body condition of bats. The group with highest survival rates contained reproductive females and juveniles with signi®cantly higher body condition. Differences in roost site or food quality within the home range of each group, varying genetic quality of members of the groups, or density-dependent mechanisms, may explain differential survival, but these hypotheses require investigation. A population crash and poor productivity in 1996 coincided with an irruption in the numbers of stoats Mustela erminea implying that predation by introduced animals can cause periodic population crashes. These results should be used to examine implications of these hypotheses on the long-term viability of Chalinolobus populations.",

Detector units recorded the number of bats passing per hour as an index of activity. Habitat use patterns were compared with longtailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) sampled concurrently. Activity levels in lesser short-tailed bats varied significantly among five habitat types and amongst hours of the night. Of the total activity recorded, most passes (82.6% of n = 657 bat passes) were in red beech forest >200 m from the forest edge; 13.7% were in silver beech within 100 m of forest edges, 2.6% were along roads through forest, 0.9% were on the forest-grassland edge, and 0.2% were in the open grassland. Lesser short-tailed bats were active throughout the night but especially at dawn and dusk. There was no correlation between levels of activity by lesser short-tailed bats and overnight minimum or dusk temperatures. Patterns of habitat use and activity in long-tailed bats were significantly different from those of lesser short-tailed bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Historical anecdotes and preliminary monitoring since 1990 indicate that New Zealand Longtailed Bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus, Vespertilionidae) are now rare or absent at many sites where formerly they were common. Chalinolobus tuberculatus appeared to be common throughout New Zealand in the 1800s but by 1900–30 it was becoming scarce in many districts. Formal surveys in the South Island since 1990 either failed to ﬁnd C. tuberculatus, or recorded bats in low numbers. Of eight sites where transect counts were undertaken, bats were recorded frequently at two sites (45–66% of counts; Eglinton and Dart Valleys), rarely at four sites (2.4–10.7% of counts), and were not recorded at the remaining two sites despite considerable survey effort. Of 10 sites where stationary counts using automatic detector units were used, no C. tuberculatus were recorded in three areas (153 nights combined), they were found rarely at six sites (2.1–21.0% of nights; 461 nights combined) and were recorded commonly only in the Eglinton Valley (85% of 120 nights). Assertions that C. tuberculatus are ‘common’ and that the conservation status is ‘secure’ are questionable and this review supports suggestions that the species should be classed as ‘Vulnerable’. Possible causes of decline have been suggested including clearance and logging of lowland forests, predation by introduced mammals and owls, competition for roost sites by introduced mammals, birds and wasps, and human interference and disturbance at roosting sites. However, authors’ claims have all been speculative and unsubstantiated. There has been no research undertaken to quantify these claims, and this is required urgently. The results of these preliminary surveys provide a new baseline against which future population trends might be compared. Increased effort using standardized monitoring techniques, applied at a national level, is required to conﬁrm the possible trends and to help identify the best sites where conservation managers may attempt to restore the population level.",

Our study reveals the repertoire of redox enzymes and hydrolytic enzymes secreted by\n              P. destructans\n              . We establish that a secreted serine peptidase, Destructin-1, is a major component of the\n              P. destructans\n              secretome. This peptidase was purified and shown to degrade collagen, the major structural protein in mammalian connective tissue. Furthermore, chemical inhibition of Destructin-1 blocked collagen degradation in conditioned media from\n              P. destructans\n              . We therefore propose that serine endopeptidases aid in invasive growth and tissue destruction by the fungus, and represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention in white-nose syndrome.\n            \n          , \n            \n              Pseudogymnoascus destructans\n              is the causative agent of white-nose syndrome, a disease that has caused the deaths of millions of bats in North America. This psychrophilic fungus proliferates at low temperatures and targets hibernating bats, resulting in their premature arousal from stupor with catastrophic consequences. Despite the impact of white-nose syndrome, little is known about the fungus itself or how it infects its mammalian host.\n              P. destructans\n              is not amenable to genetic manipulation, and therefore understanding the proteins involved in infection requires alternative approaches. Here, we identify hydrolytic enzymes secreted by\n              P. destructans\n              , and use a novel and unbiased substrate profiling technique to define active peptidases. These experiments revealed that endopeptidases are the major proteolytic activities secreted by\n              P. destructans\n              , and that collagen, the major structural protein in mammals, is actively degraded by the secretome. A serine endopeptidase, hereby-named Destructin-1, was subsequently identified, and a recombinant form overexpressed and purified. Biochemical analysis of Destructin-1 showed that it mediated collagen degradation, and a potent inhibitor of peptidase activity was identified. Treatment of\n              P. destructans\n              -conditioned media with this antagonist blocked collagen degradation and facilitated the detection of additional secreted proteolytic activities, including aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases. These results provide molecular insights into the secretome of\n              P. destructans\n              , and identify serine endopeptidases that have the clear potential to facilitate tissue invasion and pathogenesis in the mammalian host.",

We investigated male attendance at big brown bat maternity roosts in a Colorado study area that shows a pattern of sexual segregation by elevation. We tested multiple predictions of three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses to explain male attendance patterns: 1) sex-specific differences in energetic strategies of males and females are maintained at the lower elevation; 2) natal philopatry of inexperienced young males accounts for most attendants; 3) males gain a reproductive advantage for late summer mating at maternity roosts. We tested predictions based on captures of bats at emergence, automated monitoring of annual, seasonal, and daily roost attendance by known-age bats tagged with passive integrated transponders, and anatomical evidence for mating. Findings were most consistent with the first two hypotheses. Adult males accounted for just 3.1% of 8,192 captures of bats at 285 evening emergences from 46 roosts during 2001–2005. Daily attendance rates of males during each active season (0.10 detections/day at age 1 year and 0.20 detections/day at ≥ 2 years old) were lower than in females (0.34 at age 1 year and 0.45 at ≥ 2 years old). Only 92 of 299 males tagged as volant juveniles were detected as adults at five maternity roosts monitored 2002–2005, far fewer than female returns in every age category. We detected known-age adult males almost exclusively at their natal roosts and most males that returned (91 of 92) in years after tagging as juveniles were first detected as 1-year-olds; 20 of 21 individuals that returned at 2–4 years of age were previously detected as 1-year-olds. One-year-old males were re-encountered at annual rates 5–16 times higher than 2- to 4-year-old males, and 1-year-old males and females had lower daily attendance rates than older bats. The male reproductive advantage hypothesis was not well supported. None of 80 females examined in late summer had evidence of insemination, and not all males showed distended scrota. Daily attendance rates of tagged adult males (n = 155) and females (n = 788) were lowest during late summer, suggesting that little reproductive advantage was accrued by males utilizing maternity roosts. Attendance of male big brown bats at maternity roosts at our study area is consistent with the sex-specific energetic strategies and natal philopatry hypotheses, and mating probably occurs at higher elevation autumn roosts and hibernacula.",

Of these, one isolate was resistant to chlortetracycline and streptomycin, and nine were resistant to sulfadimethoxine (SDMX). Half of these (n = 5) resistant isolates had the transmissible R plasmid for antimicrobials suggesting that OLHB is a species that hardly harbors antimicrobial‐resistant\n              Enterobacteriaceae.\n              One possible reason for this low prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is that the bat lives in a clean environment with no or only very low artificial drug contaminations due to low contact with such as livestock that frequently carries antibiotic‐resistant bacteria. This study suggests that it's important to monitor antimicrobial resistance of\n              Enterobacteriaceae\n              in OLHB as a model for natural R plasmid transfer in a natural environment without specific pathological bacteria and artificial drugs.",

The genetic diversity of T. rangeli and its association with host species (triatomines and mammals) has been identiﬁed along Central and the South America; however, it has not included data of isolates from Ecuador. This study reports infection with T. rangeli in 18 genera of mammal hosts and ﬁve species of triatomines in three environments (domestic, peridomestic, and sylvatic). Higher infection rates were found in the sylvatic environment, in close association with Rhodnius ecuadoriensis. The results of this study extend the range of hosts infected with this parasite and the geographic range of the T. rangeli genotype KP1(-)/lineage C in South America. It was not possible to detect variation on T. rangeli from the central coastal region and southern Ecuador with the analysis of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) gene, even though these areas are ecologically different and a phenotypic subdivision of R. ecuadoriensis has been found. R. ecuadoriensis is considered one of the most important vectors for Chagas disease transmission in Ecuador due to its wide distribution and adaptability to diverse environments. An extensive knowledge of the trypanosomes circulating in this species of triatomine, and associated mammal hosts, is important for delineating transmission dynamics and preventive measures in the endemic areas of Ecuador and Northern Peru.",

This tick is found throughout the northeastern, coastal southeastern, and upper midwestern United States and is considered the most significant vector of tick-borne pathogens to humans in North America. Despite its ubiquity and broad host range, I. scapularis previously has not been reported feeding on bats (Chiroptera). However, during 2019 and 2020, larvae and nymphs of I. scapularis were recovered from big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus (Palisot de Beauvois), at four locations in rural NewYork State, USA. All Ixodes infested bats were injured and found on the ground; therefore, parasitism by I. scapularis was likely opportunistic. Nonetheless, the large number of pathogens known to be associated with bats and the frequency with which I. scapularis bites people suggest that this host–tick relationship is of at least potential epidemiological significance.",

The specimen was excavated from a pre-Columbian archeological cave deposit in association with stone tools, bivalve shells, snake and fish vertebrae, and capromyid (rodent) postcranial elements. Although the deposit is not directly dated, the relationship of the assemblage to the time of Amerindian occupation in this cave suggests an age between 1600 and 850 years BP. Therefore, this report may constitute a probable ‘last occurrence’ date for M. megalophylla in Cuba. This bat is believed to have gone extirpated in the West Indies because of a combination of habitat-area loss due to climatic turnover during the late Pleistocene and human disturbance later in the Holocene. Based on new evidence, we add that climate-related bat extirpations could lag for several thousands of years after the onset of new environmental conditions, and that these can be easily accelerated by anthropogenic disturbance. This information can help improve the understanding of chiropteran diversity, causes, and timing of extirpations in Cuba and the West Indies.",

            "abstractNote": "In recent years, there has been an increasing risk of hematophagous bat attacks in Latin America, where livestock production is a basic source of food for local populations. In Ecuador, livestock represented an important part of agricultural output. Some cases of cattle bitten by bats in the province of Santa Elena have been reported; however, no previous studies have been conducted to determine the magnitude of the attacks and the associated risk factors. In this research, a cross-sectional descriptive study was performed recording attacks of hematophagous bats (Desmodus rotundus) through visual inspection of livestock and the capture of specimens by mist nets. Generally, the prevalence of D. rotundus attacks on farms was 69%, whereas attacks on bovine had 24% of prevalence. From the captured specimens, 93% were identiﬁed as D. rotundus and within the 30% of the captured D. rotundus, no infections for rabies virus were diagnosed. The univariable analysis used for estimating the risk factors associated with bat attacks showed that corrals away from populated centers present the highest risk (odds ratio [OR] = 19.864; p = 0.0004), followed by tree density >30 per hectare (OR = 16.313; p < 0.0001) and predatory birds of bats (OR = 15.375; p < 0.0001); a binary logistic regression model showed ‘‘corrals away from populated centers’’ (OR = 23.47; p = 0.006) as the main risk factor. Linear regression analysis showed good correlation between the number of bovines attacked and the number of bites (R2 = 0.977; p < 0.0001) suggesting some feeding patterns of D. rotundus. This study could be used as a starting point for understanding the feeding habits of D. rotundus and factors governing their attacks in coastal regions of Ecuador, and potential occurrences of rabies infections. With this knowledge, surveillance and control programs can be supported to improve rabies transmission monitoring.",

            "abstractNote": "The claustrum is a gray‐matter structure that underlies neocortex and reciprocates connections with cortical and subcortical targets. In lower mammals, the claustrum is directly adjacent to neocortex, making the definition of claustral boundaries challenging. Latexin, an endogenous inhibitor of metallocarboxypeptidases, localizes to claustral cells, enabling a clear delineation of claustrum. Given its proportionately large claustrum, we hypothesized that the short‐tailed fruit bat,\n              Carollia perspicillata,\n              can be a useful model for claustral structure–function relations. We used latexin immunohistochemistry to identify claustral boundaries and intrinsic structure and multielectrode recordings from brain slices to explore intrinsic excitatory connectivity of the claustrum.\n            \n            \n              Carollia's\n              claustrum contains cells whose intrinsic connectivity and alignment permit the generation of spontaneous, synchronous population events and mirror their pattern of spread in disinhibited brain slices over millimeters.\n              Carollia\n              shows cellular alignment and spontaneous population‐activity spread along both horizontal and dorsoventral axes.\n              Carollia\n              claustrum possesses intrinsic excitatory connectivity sufficient to: 1) generate single, spontaneous, synchronized burst discharges, 2) support activity spread along axes where claustral cells are aligned, and 3), because of multiple axes for cell alignment, support activity spread along both rostrocaudal and dorsoventral axes. The smaller event sizes in bat claustrum compared with rat claustrum are consistent with events occurring in population subsets rather than the full claustral cell population. The overall size of claustrum, its pronounced vascularity, and its more complex intrinsic connectivity than rat suggest that the bat is an animal model for claustral structure and function that will permit unique access to claustrum's processing capabilities.

In order to study behaviour and to examine patterns of paternity and relatedness between different harem groups, we developed 14 microsatellite loci from two different enriched genomic libraries. We screened 125 individuals from two different bat colonies and found that polymorphism ranged from five to 13 alleles. Heterozygosity ranged from 63 to 95%. The primers amplified across 14 bat species, indicating their potential utility for population-level studies in several closely related bat species.",

A log‐linear model was used to evaluate the frequency distribution of visits to harems by sex, season and agonistic interaction of dominant males. Harem group size varied from four to 18 females, with one adult male in the small and medium‐sized groups and two males in the large groups (> 14 females). A highly significant interaction was noted between the age and sex of the visitor and the response of the dominant male. Male visitors were attacked more often than female and juvenile visitors. Aggressive defence increased during the reproductive seasons, with dominant males showing more agonistic responses towards male visitors. An increase in the frequency of visits by male visitors was noted in harem groups that ranged in size from four to 12 females, but the frequency of male visits declined in harem groups that contained more than 14 females.",

We studied harems of 4–20 females associated with a dominant male in small groups of Artibeus jamaicensis (,14 females), and with dominant and subordinate males in large groups (.14 females). Dominant males displayed defensive behavior toward satellite males when they intruded into the roosting site. Small groups received the highest number of visits by satellite males, and dominant males did not display total defense of females. During the breeding season, females roosted in highly compacted clusters and dominant males were more active in their defensive behavior. Subordinate males were generally tolerated in harem groups and their presence reduced the number of adult male visits. Some young in large harem groups were sired by subordinate males, resulting in a genetic beneﬁt for both dominant and subordinate males. Dominant males had the highest ﬁtness in the large harem groups by sharing paternity with related subordinate males and by rejecting unrelated intruders.",

A total of 84 adults captured in two caves exhibited little genetic differentiation between caves (FST = 0.008). Average relatedness among adult females in 10 harem groups was very low (R = 0.014 ± 0.011), providing no evidence of harem structure. Dominant and subordinate males shared paternity in large groups, while dominant and satellite males shared paternity in smaller groups. However, our results suggest that male rank influences paternity. Dominant males fathered 69% of 40 offspring, followed by satellite (22%) and subordinate males (9%). Overall adult male bats are not closely related, however, in large harem groups we found that subordinate and dominant males exhibited relatedness values consistent with a father-offspring relationship. Because dominant and subordinate males also sired all the pups in large groups, we propose that their association provides inclusive fitness to them.",

The endemic ﬁsh-eating myotis (Myotis vivesi) is restricted to a few insular ecosystems in the Gulf of California, where it feeds on both marine and terrestrial prey; yet it is unknown whether its diet covaries with marine primary productivity. We determined the relative contribution of marine and terrestrial food sources to the diet of the ﬁsh-eating myotis to test the hypothesis that seasonal changes in oceanic primary productivity would dictate general feeding patterns of this bat species. We predicted that marine food would predominate in the diet of the bat during winter followed by an increase in importance of terrestrial food sources as summer approached. We measured amount of feces deposited in the day roost per bat and extrapolated this value to estimate amount of feces deposited in 1 year by the ﬁsh-eating myotis population in Partida Norte Island. Carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of bat blood and examination of food remains in feces showed that marine food was the main source of nutrients for ﬁsh-eating myotis throughout the year. Importance of terrestrial food was marginal during most of the year, with a modest increase in summer. Estimated annual feces production was up to 1,518 kg. Because of its predominantly marine feeding habits, ﬁsheating myotis transfer allochthonous nutrients to islands where they roost, subsidizing the nutrient and energy economy of the islands.",

Litomosoides molossi Esslinger, 1973 was recovered from the thoracic and abdominal cavities of Molossus molossus (prevalence [P] ¼ 6.4%); Litomosoides chandleri Esslinger, 1973 from Artibeus planirostris (P ¼ 6.9%), Sturnira oporaphilum (P ¼ 66.6%), Sturnira erythromos (P ¼ 23.8%), Sturnira lilium (P ¼ 7.2%), and Eumops perotis (P ¼ 50%); and Litomosoides saltensis n. sp. was collected from Eptesicus furinalis (P ¼ 1.7%). In this paper, we emend the description of L. molossi; describe a new species, Litomosoides saltensis n. sp., on the basis of 1 female specimen; and report for the ﬁrst time L. molossi and L. chandleri parasitizing Argentinean bats, expanding the host and locality records. Litomosoides molossi exhibits a slender buccal capsule, with an anterior segment transparent, and the posterior chitinous portion displays 2 thickenings in the ﬁrst third; possesses 1 dorsal prominent cephalic papilla and 4 labial papillae distributed around the mouth; cuticle with lateral punctuations all along the hypodermic chords in both sexes; and male with area rugosa and tail without cloacal papillae. In L. chandleri, the lateral punctuations are distributed on the posterior extremity of the body in both sexes. Litomosoides saltensis n. sp. displays a thick buccal capsule with a posterior segment well cuticularized, possessing 2 thickenings in the anterior half; 4 labial and 2 ventral cephalic papillae; a globular vulva located anterior to the esophagus–intestine junction; cuticle with lateral punctuations in the posterior extremity of the body; and tail with salient phasmids. We also provide a taxonomic key for the identiﬁcation of the Litomosoides sp. of bat dwelling. Long-term studies and large sample sizes are needed to detect the presence of Litomosoides sp. in bats, in contrast to the ﬁndings in cricetid rodents, which seem to be more frequently collected.",

Nondifferentially stained karyotypes were scored for 291 specimens from 5 localities. Each locality was near a locality from which similar data on U. bilobatum have been reported in the literature 18 years ago. G-tests indicated no signiﬁcant differences between our data and the historical data at 2 localities in El Salvador; signiﬁcant differences were found at the contact zone in Honduras. Based on a combined sample of 834 specimens, by means of the point at which genotype frequencies equal 20% and 80% (20/80 rule), we estimated that 3 chromosomal morphs (designated Aa, Bb, and Cc) had an average clinal width of 33.3 km. The widest cline, Bb, was 12.53 km wider than the narrowest, Cc. Morph Cc was detected at 2 localities, 72 and 80 km northwest of the nearest locality from which it was previously known. Overall, we detected little change in clinal architecture during the intervening years between these 2 analyses. Four investigators who used the same data set have published 4 different interpretations of clinal dynamics. These interpretations are mutually contradictory and so all cannot be correct.",

            "abstractNote": "Anoura is a Neotropical genus of long-tongued bats containing at least 10 species, whose taxonomy has been revised substantially in recent years. Herein, we describe a new species of Anoura from the Cordillera Oriental of the Peruvian Andes, inhabiting montane forests (Yungas) at 1900–3450 m altitude, along the Río Cosñipata valley in Manu Biosphere Reserve, Cuzco; where it is sympatric with A. peruana, A. cultrata, and A. caudifer. This new species is most similar to A. caudifer and A. aequatoris, but it is distinguished from them by a unique combination of morphological characters: pelage dark; uropatagium narrow with margins densely furred; foot claws whitish; skull with a long and narrow rostrum; zygomatic arches complete and straight (in lateral view); posterolateral margins of palate without processes; braincase smoothly rounded; first upper premolar (P2) peg-like and separated from the upper canine by a wide gap; second upper premolar (P3) without anterobasal cusp; mandible long, straight, thin and delicate with a large symphysis. Principal Component Analysis separated well the new species from A. aequatoris and A. caudifer. In MANOVA analyses, followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test, the new species differed significantly from A. aequatoris and A. caudifer in six and 11 characters, respectively. The new species and A. aequatoris have montane distributions, whereas A. caudifer occurs at lower elevations. In Peru, the new species and A. aequatoris show disjunct distributions: the former in the central and southern regions, and the latter in the north-central region of the country. This suggests a vicariant effect probably related to the deep Río Apurímac. Finally, we comment on the taxonomy of the A. caudifer complex, discuss the biogeographical implications of the discovery of the new species, and suggest the recognition of a new region of endemism for small mammals in the southern Yungas, south of the Río Apurímac to Bolivia.",

            "abstractNote": "Sympatry in flying-foxes is common and it occurs throughout coastal Australia, however Pteropus conspicillatus and P. poliocephalus are thought to have allopatric populations. We examine the distribution of these two flying-fox species and report on the first flyingfox camp (day roost) with all four species of Australian mainland Pteropus co-occurring. Climatic models were developed from previous records to determine if the location of this new camp is climatically suitable for these species. We found that this location is climatically suitable to some degree for both P. conspicillatus and P. poliocephalus but that the latter had a higher climatic suitability at this site. Historical records exist for P. poliocephalus close to this location but not for P. conspicillatus. The location of this mixed-species flying-fox camp is the most southerly distribution for P. conspicillatus, being 500 km further south than previous records. This area of overlap creates potential opportunities for interbreeding between P. conspicillatus and P. poliocephalus. Therefore, monitoring of this region for the location of further mixed-species camps and the degree of panmixia at those locations is highly desirable.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats (Chiroptera) constitute the second largest order of mammals and have several distinctive features, such as true self-powered flight and strong immunity. The Pendlebury’s roundleaf bat, Hipposideros pendleburyi, is endemic to Thailand and listed as a vulnerable species. We employed the 10Â Genomics linked-read technology to obtain a genome assembly of H. pendleburyi. The assembly size was 2.17 Gb with a scaffold N50 length of 15,398,518 bases. Our phylogenetic analysis placed H. pendleburyi within the rhinolophoid clade of the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. A synteny analysis showed that H. pendleburyi shared conserved chromosome segments (up to 105 Mb) with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Phyllostomus discolor albeit having different chromosome numbers and belonging different families. We found positive selection signals in genes involved in inflammation, spermatogenesis and Wnt signalling. The analyses of transposable elements suggested the contraction of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and the accumulation of young mariner DNA transposons in the analysed hipposiderids. Distinct mariners were likely horizontally transferred to hipposiderid genomes over the evolution of this family. The lineage-specific profiles of SINEs and mariners might involve in the evolution of hipposiderids and be associated with the phylogenetic separations of these bats from other bat families.",

The flowers are white, tiny and in dense fascicles. The foraging activities of the two bat species were segregated in space and time. Cynopterus sphinx fed on resources at lower heights in the trees than P. giganteus and its peak foraging activity occurred at 19:30 h, before that of P. giganteus. Foraging activities involved short searching flights followed by landing and removal of the corolla by mouth. Cynopterus sphinx detached single corollas from fascicles and carried them to nearby feeding roosts, where it sucked the juice and spat out the fibrous remains. Pteropus giganteus landed on top of the trees and fed on the corollas in situ; its peak activity occurred at 20:30 h. This species glided and crawled between the branches and held the branches with claws and forearms when removing fleshy corollas with its mouth. Both C. sphinx and P. giganteus consumed fleshy corollas with attached stamens and left the gynoecium intact. Bagging experiments showed that fruit-set in bat-visited flowers was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than in self-pollinated flowers.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus) that roost in subterranean hibernacula have experienced precipitous declines from white-nose syndrome (WNS); however, understudied populations also use during winter non-subterranean roosts such as tree cavities, bridges, and foliage. Our objectives were to determine winter roost use by tricolored bats in an area devoid of subterranean roosts, determine roost microclimates to relate them to growth requirements of the fungal causal agent of WNS, and determine habitat factors influencing winter tree selection. From November to March 2017–2019, we used radiotelemetry to track 15 bats to their day roosts in the upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina and recorded microclimates in accessible tree cavities and bridges. We also characterized habitat and tree characteristics of 24 used trees and 153 random, available trees and used discrete choice models to determine selection. Roost structures included I-beam bridges, cavities in live trees, and foliage. Bridges were warmer and less humid than cavities. Roost temperatures often were amenable to fungal growth (&lt; 19.5°C) but fluctuated widely depending on ambient temperatures. Bats used bridges on colder days (8.7°C ± 5.0 SD) and trees on warmer days (11.3°C ± 5.4). Bats selected low-decay trees closer to streams in areas with high canopy closure and cavity abundance. Bats also appeared to favor hardwood forests and avoid pine forests. Our results suggest that access to multiple roost microclimates might be important for tricolored bats during winter, and forest management practices that retain live trees near streams and foster cavity formation in hardwood forests likely will benefit this species. Our results also suggest tricolored bats using bridge and tree roosts might be less susceptible to WNS than bats using subterranean hibernaculum roosts. Thus, forests in areas without subterranean hibernacula in the southeastern United States that support bats during winter might represent important refugia from WNS for multiple species.",

Flowers of the African sausage tree Kigelia africana are visited by bats and bush babies during the night and by birds during the day. We studied floral traits (phenophases, scent, color, and nectar chemistry) and the visitation frequency and pollination effectiveness of different flower visitors to determine whether K. africana is functionally specialized for bat pollination. We found that flower opening corresponds with bat activity, flowers emit scent dominated by aliphatic esters and alcohols, and that nectar is produced in copious amounts accessible to bats. Pollen deposition on stigmas was twenty-fold greater per visit by bats than it was per visit by birds, likely a result of the close morphological fit between snouts of bats and the flowers. However, bat visits appear to be rare at some sites and the delayed senescence of flowers that are open throughout the morning provides an opportunity for additional pollination by birds. We conclude that K. africana is primarily adapted for bat pollination, but is also able to exploit other animals for pollination.",

However, the diversification of echolocation call structure in bats allows for considerable morphological similarity while still permitting niche differentiation based on specialisation for prey type and habitat structure. The recent separation of a common Palaearctic bat, the pipistrelle, into\n              Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n              and\n              P. pygmaeus,\n              which are sympatrically distributed throughout their range, raises the question as to whether these two morphologically similar species partition resources in time and space.\n            \n            \n              To test the hypothesis that the coexistence of these cryptic species is facilitated by differential habitat use, 14\n              P\n              .\n              pipistrellus\n              , and 12\n              P. pygmaeus\n              were radio‐tracked from adjacent maternity roosts, in northeast Scotland, from May to September 2002/2003. The two species showed distinct habitat partitioning with\n              P. pygmaeus\n              foraging predominantly in riparian woodland and over water, and\n              P. pipistrellus\n              foraging along woodland edges and short isolated tree lines. Inter‐specific overlap in habitat use was low and consequently foraging ranges were segregated spatially.\n            \n            The degree of habitat partitioning revealed in these species, which show considerable overlap in echolocation call parameters and functional morphology, suggests that morphological features, whilst useful in separating chiropteran species into coarse‐grained foraging guilds, may not predict fine‐grained ecological segregation.",

We surveyed three mule deer herds across the state of Nevada for infection with relapsing fever Borrelia spp. spirochetes. Bacterial prevalence varied by the county where deer were sampled but Borrelia spirochetes were detected in 7.7% of all deer sampled. Infected deer were identiﬁed in every location from which mule deer samples were obtained. Sequencing of the Borrelia intergenic spacer gene (IGS) revealed that one individual was infected with Borrelia coriaceae and all others were infected with Borrelia hermsii. The vector of B. hermsii, Ornithodoros hermsi (Acari: Argasidae, Wheeler, Herms, and Meyer, 1935), feeds primarily on wild rodents and has not been identiﬁed infesting deer. Additionally, Ornithodoros coriaceus (Acari: Argasidae, Koch, 1844), which readily feeds on deer and is frequently infected with B. coriaceae, has not been shown to be a competent vector for B. hermsii. Our data represent the ﬁrst sylvatic evidence of B. hermsii infection in mule deer. Additionally, our data provide evidence that infection with relapsing fever spirochetes in Nevada is wide ranging in the state’s deer populations.",

However, important information on their behaviour and movement ecology, such as the locations and altitudes at which they forage, is still fragmentary, while crucial for their conservation in light of the increasing threat posed by progressing WT construction. We adopted two different methods of microphone array recordings and GPS-tracking capturing data from different spatio-temporal scales in order to gain a complementary understanding of the echolocation and movement ecology of\n              Nyctalus aviator\n              , the largest open-space bat in Japan. Based on microphone array recordings, we found that echolocation calls during natural foraging are adapted for fast flight in open-space optimal for aerial-hawking. In addition, we attached a GPS tag that can simultaneously monitor feeding buzz occurrence, and confirmed that foraging occurred at 300 m altitude and that the flight altitude in mountainous areas is consistent with the turbine conflict zone, suggesting that the birdlike noctule is a high-risk species in Japan. Further investigations on this species could provide valuable insights into their foraging and movement ecology, facilitating the development of a risk assessment regarding WTs.",

Bioactive lipid mediators (oxylipins) formed by enzymatic oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids can contribute to these immune responses, but have not been investigated in WNS pathophysiology. Nonenzymatic conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids can also occur due to reactive oxygen species, however, these enantiomeric isomers will lack the same signaling properties. In this study, we performed a series of targeted lipidomic approaches on laboratory Pseudogymnoascus destructans-inoculated bats to assess changes in their splenic lipidome, including the formation of lipid mediators at early stages of WNS. Hepatic lipids previously identified were also resolved to a higher structural detail. We compared WNS-susceptible M. lucifugus to a WNS-resistant species, the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). Altered splenic lipid levels were only observed in M. lucifugus. Differences in splenic free fatty acids included both omega-3 and omega-6 compounds. Increased levels of an enantiomeric monohydroxy DHA mixture were found, suggesting nonenzymatic formation. Changes in previously identified hepatic lipids were confined to omega-3 constituents. Together, these results suggest that increased oxidative stress, but not an inflammatory response, is occurring in bats at early stages of WNS that precedes fat depletion. These data have been submitted to metabolomics workbench and assigned a study number ST002304.",

            "abstractNote": "White nose syndrome (WNS) is a cutaneous fungal disease of bats. WNS is responsible for unprecedented mortalities in North American cave bat populations. There have been few descriptions of enzyme activities that may function in WNS host/pathogen interactions, while no study has isolated and described secreted proteases. To address the hypothesis that Pseudogymnoascus destructans secretes extracellular proteases that function in wing necrosis during WNS infection, the object of this study was to culture P. destructans on various media, then isolate and structurally identify those proteases accumulated stably in the culture medium. We found a single dominant protease activity on minimal nutrient broth enriched with protein substrates, which was strongly inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. This P. destructans serine protease (PdSP1) was isolated by preparative isoelectric focusing and concanavalin A lectin affinity chromatography. PdSP1 showed a molecular weight 27,900 (estimated by SDS-PAGE), broad pH optimum 6-8, and temperature optimum 60°C. Structural characterization of PdSP1 by MALDI-TOF MS, Orbitrap MS/MS, and Edman amino-terminal peptide sequencing matched it directly to a hypothetical protein accession from the sequenced P. destructans genome that is further identified as a MEROPS family S8A subtilisin-like serine peptidase. Two additional isoforms, PdSP2 and PdSP3, were identified in the P. destructans genome with 90% and 53% homology, respectively. P. destructans S8A serine proteases showed closer sequence conservation to P. pannorum and plant pathogenic fungi than to human pathogenic dermatophytes. Peptide-specific polyclonal antibodies developed from the PdSP1 sequence detected the protein in western blots. These subtilisin-like serine proteases are candidates for further functional studies in WNS host-pathogen interaction.",

The most mineralized elements are the humerus and the radius, followed by the metacarpals, of which the third and fifth are the most mineralized. The proximal and middle phalanges of the third digit exhibit the lowest mineral content, and the distal phalanges have no mineral content according to our ashing protocol. Histological examination shows a thin (< 10 μm) shell of unmineralized osteoid surrounding a cartilaginous core in distal phalanges. Mineral content of each bone increases linearly with age during post‐natal development, but there are differences in the rate and extent of this increase among the different elements.\n            \n            The mineralizaton differences we observed parallel substantially different bone loading patterns found in different parts of the wing in other studies. The humerus and radius are subjected to large torsional loads during flight, while the metacarpals and phalanges experience dorsoventral bending. The high mineral content of the humerus and radius and the low mineral content of the metacarpals and phalanges may resist torsion proximally and promote bending distally. Furthermore, the decrease in mineral content along the wing's proximodistal axis decreases bone mass disproportionately at the wing tips, where the energetic cost of accelerating and decelerating limb mass is greatest.",

However, in the present study it is reported that at the Gordon site in suburban Sydney, colony numbers were negatively correlated with the occurrence of pollen in the droppings. In addition, in contrast to reported occupational patterns at other colony sites, where ﬂying-foxes are not present at the site during winter and early spring, the Gordon site was occupied by substantial numbers of ﬂying-foxes throughout the entire period of 62 months from 1985 to 1990. As a result of the introduction of plants native to other parts of Australia and exotics from other continents, there is a variety of foods available throughout the year in the Sydney region, in comparison with less urbanized areas. This food supply permits the occupation of the Gordon colony site during winter and spring and reduces the migratory behaviour of ﬂying-foxes throughout the year. It is concluded that in the absence of a restrictive food supply, the occupational pattern of the Gordon colony of P. poliocephalus is the result of the reproductive requirements of the species modiﬁed by the vagaries of blossom production in the native forests outside the foraging range of the colony.",

The three genes lie in tandem within a 2.5-kb region of chromosome arm 3R. In a sample of eight alleles from a worldwide distribution we found a signiﬁcant departure from neutrality by several statistical tests. The most striking feature of this sample was that in a 1.7-kb region containing the janA and janB genes, 30 out of 31 segregating sites contained variants present only once in the sample, and 29 of these unique variants were found in the same allele. A restriction survey of an additional 28 lines of D. simulans revealed strong linkage disequilibrium over the janA-janB region and identiﬁed six more alleles matching the rare haplotype. Among the rare alleles, the level of DNA sequence variation was typical for D. simulans autosomal genes and showed no departure from neutrality. In addition, the rare haplotype was more similar to the D. melanogaster sequence, indicating that it was the ancestral form. These results suggest that the derived haplotype has risen to high worldwide frequency relatively recently, most likely as a result of natural selection.",

Pollen availability, abiotic resources, and flowering pattern can limit fruit and seed production. Open pollination and pollen supplementation studies are used to estimate any pollen limitation in natural populations. To study the impact of these factors on the reproductive success of\n              Vriesea gigantea\n              , an epiphytic bromeliad in the Atlantic Rainforest in Brazil, its fertility in four natural populations in Itapuã State Park was assessed by considering plant and inflorescence size, flower production, fruit and seed set, flower and fruit set pattern, and seed viability and germination rate. Supplemental pollination in adult plants was used to determine whether fruit production in\n              V. gigantea\n              is limited by reception of pollen. The results showed that\n              V. gigantea\n              has a high production of flowers, fruits, and seeds. Seeds are highly viable in all populations, presenting an average germination rate of 94% (SE ± 3.5). Plants of\n              V. gigantea\n              from Itapuã State Park are highly fertile. The high proportion of fruit and seed set after manual hand pollination indicates that the species is self‐compatible. Pollination treatments showed evidence of pollinator limitation in the Itapuã State Park population.",

            "abstractNote": "We examined the histological structure of the kidneys of Myotis myotis to better understand their structural adaptations to dietary habits. M. myotis is an insectivorous bat species that belongs to the family Vespertilionidae. The kidneys of M. myotis are unilobular, bean-shaped, and surrounded by a renal capsule. The two parts are distinguished by a thin cortex and a thicker medulla. Renal corpuscles consist of the glomerulus and Bowman's capsule. The proximal tubule consists of cubic cells with a well-developed brush border, whereas the distal tubule is lined with a simple cubic epithelium without a brush border. The Henle's loop, located in the medullary region, was composed of flat cells. The microvilli of proximal tubule epithelial cells and basal lamina of proximal and distal tubule epithelial cells were periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive. The PAS-positive reaction of the microvilli of proximal tubular epithelial cells and basal lamina of proximal and distal tubule epithelial cells is due to the presence of glycogen, which may be used as an energy substrate during absorption. The presence of acidic glycoconjugates in the papilla was demonstrated by Alcian blue (pH 2.5)-PAS staining. According to the result of silver impregnation staining, it was determined that reticular fibers form a dense fibrillary network in the kidney parenchymal tissue. Reticular fibers are responsible for demarcating and supporting the borders of cells by forming a thin network of fibrils beneath the basal lamina of the cells. Structural features in the kidney, such as a thin cortex and thicker medulla, long conical papilla, and division of the thick medulla into inner and outer regions, of M. myotis may be an adaptation to produce concentrated urine, thereby reducing water loss associated with insectivorous feeding habits.",

For this purpose, 10 specimens of oesophagus were collected and processed. The oesophagus wall of M. myotis is composed of four layers: tunica mucosa, tunica submucosa, tunica muscularis and tunica adventitia. The mucosa is covered by a non-­keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. There were no glands in the wall of the oesophagus. Tunica muscularis is composed of two muscle layers: internal circular muscular layer and an external longitudinal muscular layer. Histochemical studies revealed that the oesophagus was AB/PAS and PAS positive indicating the presence of acidic and neutral mucosubstances. AB-­PAS staining shows that glycoproteins were predominant in the all examined layers of the oesophagus. Because of the absence of oesophageal glands in M. myotis, positive reaction with AB-­PAS staining may be due to secretion of salivary glands. Absence of oesophageal glands reflects the functional adaptation as high food passage rate for the insectivorous feeding habits of animals.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) of bats has devastated bat populations in eastern North America since its discovery in 2006. WNS, caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans, has spread quickly in North America and has become one of the most severe wildlife epidemics of our time. While P. destructans is spreading rapidly in North America, nothing is known about the sexual capacity of this fungus. To gain insight into the genes involved in sexual reproduction, we characterized the mating-type locus (MAT) of two Pseudogymnoascus spp. that are closely related to P. destructans and homothallic (self-fertile). As with other homothallic Ascomycota, the MAT locus of these two species encodes a conserved a-box protein (MAT1-1-1) as well as two high-mobility group (HMG) box proteins (MAT1-1-3 and MAT1-2-1). Comparisons with the MAT locus of the North American isolate of P. destructans (the ex-type isolate) revealed that this isolate of P. destructans was missing a clear homolog of the conserved HMG box protein (MAT1-2-1). These data prompted the discovery and molecular characterization of a heterothallic mating system in isolates of P. destructans from the Czech Republic. Both mating types of P. destructans were found to coexist within hibernacula, suggesting the presence of mating populations in Europe. Although populations of P. destructans in North America are thought to be clonal and of one mating type, the potential for sexual recombination indicates that continued vigilance is needed regarding introductions of additional isolates of this pathogen.",

Calls of bats landing and feeding on a platform in Wellington Zoo were also recorded. Both the lowest frequency and frequency of peak amplitude of calls were significantly affected by the situation under which calls were recorded. Although the calls of free-flying bats are different from those produced by bats foraging on the ground, it is unlikely that M. tuberculata uses echolocation to locate prey on the ground. No significant differences could be found between the calls emitted by male and female bats, and no consistent relationships were obvious between temporal and spectral call characteristics. There was some evidence to suggest that individual bats could be identified by their echolocation calls.",

Temporal and spectral parameters were measured from time-expanded calls and power spectra generated for both timeexpanded and heterodyned calls. Arti®cial neural networks were trained to classify the calls of both species using temporal and spectral parameters and power spectra as input data. Networks were then tested using data not previously seen. Calls could be unambiguously identi®ed using parameters and power spectra from time-expanded calls. A neural network, trained and tested using power spectra of calls from both species recorded using a heterodyne detector set to 40 kHz (the frequency with the most energy of the fundamental of C. tuberculatus call), could identify 99% and 84% of calls of C. tuberculatus and M. tuberculata, respectively. A second network, trained and tested using power spectra of calls from both species recorded using a heterodyne detector set to 27 kHz (the frequency with the most energy of the fundamental of M. tuberculata call), could identify 34% and 100% of calls of C. tuberculatus and M. tuberculata, respectively. This study represents the ®rst use of neural networks for the identi®cation of bats from their echolocation calls. It is also the ®rst study to use power spectra of time-expanded and heterodyned calls for identi®cation of chiropteran species. The ability of neural networks to identify bats from their echolocation calls is discussed, as is the ecology of both species in relation to the design of their echolocation calls.",

However, the pattern of call production with limb movement in terrestrially agile bats has never been investigated. We used synchronised high-speed video and audio recordings to determine patterns of association between echolocation call production and limb motion by Mystacina tuberculata Gray 1843 as individuals walked and flew, respectively. Results showed that there was no apparent linkage between call production and limb motion when bats walked. When in flight, two calls were produced per wingbeat, late in the downstroke and early in the upstroke. When bats walked, calls were produced at a higher rate, but at a slightly lower intensity, compared with bats in flight. These results suggest that M. tuberculata do not attempt to reduce the cost of terrestrial locomotion and call production through biomechanical linkage. They also suggest that the pattern of linkage seen when bats are in flight is not universal and that energetic savings cannot necessarily be explained by contraction of muscles associated with the downstroke alone.",

            "abstractNote": "Background: Free-tailed bats of the genus Otomops are poorly known, and most species are documented from a handful of widely scattered localities. Recently, two allopatric species of Otomops were recognized in continental Africa: Otomops martiensseni (Matschie, 1897) in southern, central and western Africa, and the new species O. harrisoni Ralph et al., 2015 in the northeast and in Yemen. Methods: We collected additional samples of Otomops in Kenya and Rwanda where the ranges of these taxa approach one another to clarify their geographic ranges and taxonomic status. Mitochondrial and nuclear intron sequences served to identify and delimit species; we also documented their echolocation call variation and ectoparasite complements. Results: Otomops martiensseni, the southern African species, was documented in northern Kenya in Marsabit National Park. O. harrisoni, the northeastern African–Arabian species, was documented in southern Kenya and in a cave in Musanze District, Rwanda. Moreover, individuals of both species were found together at the Musanze cave, establishing them in precise spatial and temporal sympatry. Analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear loci identify no evidence of admixture between these forms, although available samples limit the power of this analysis. Echolocation call differences are also apparent among the three localities we analyzed. Three orders of insects and two families of mites are newly reported as ectoparasites of O. harrisoni. Discussion: Our results corroborate species rank for O. harrisoni and establish a zone of potential geographic overlap with O. martiensseni spanning at least 800 km of latitude. The new records establish the species in sympatry in northern Rwanda and add an additional species to the bat faunas of both Kenya and Rwanda.",

The species is distributed across most of the Neotropical mainlands, ranging from southeastern Mexico through Central and South America south to northeastern Bolivia and central Brazil. P. gymnonotus has been considered as an uncommon species in most parts of its geographic distribution but there are some reports of more numerous local populations. It is an aerial insectivore that forages in open areas and gallery forests. Like other mormoopids P. gymnonotus usually forms large colonies roosting preferentially in hot and humid caves. It is currently listed as “Least Concern” according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources Red List.",

The possibility that this species feeds on terrestrial vertebrates, a behaviour here referred to as carnivory, was suggested by the similarity of three of its morphological features with those of eight of the 10 species of bats known to exhibit carnivory.\n            \n            \n              The study confirmed that\n              H. diadema\n              is at least occasionally carnivorous. Bird feathers were found in faeces at both sites; however, their occurrence was limited to a collection of faecal pellets from the early dry season at Iron Range and a single pellet from the wet season at Chillagoe. The birds taken could not be identified to family or species. Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and various orthopteroid orders were the main insect taxa in faecal pellets. The frequency of these taxa in the diet varied significantly among the three seasons at both sites. Analysis of prey remains indicated that large, hard‐bodied insects, mainly cerambycid and scarabaeid beetles and acridid grasshoppers, particularly the locust\n              Gastrimargus musicus\n              , were taken frequently. The mean length of intact beetle elytra collected below roosts was 18.0 mm. No vertebrate material was found in prey remains.\n              Hipposideros diadema\n              is similar to several other bats which exhibit carnivory in preying infrequently on vertebrates. The term ‘partial carnivore’ or ‘occasional carnivore’ is suggested for these species.",

We evaluated antirabies antibody seroprevalence and the presence of ectoparasites in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) sampled in 2002 and 2003 in Colorado to investigate if an association existed between ectoparasite intensity and exposure to rabies virus (RV). We used logistic regression and Akaike’s Information Criteria adjusted for sample size (AICc) in a post-hoc analysis to investigate the relative importance of three ectoparasite species, as well as bat colony size, year sampled, age class, colony size, and year interaction on the presence of rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (VNA) in serum of wild E. fuscus. We obtained serum samples and ectoparasite counts from big brown bats simultaneously in 2002 and 2003. Although the presence of ectoparasites (Steatonyssus occidentalis and Spinturnix bakeri) were important in elucidating VNA seroprevalence, their intensities were higher in seronegative bats than in seropositive bats, and the presence of a third ectoparasite (Cimex pilosellus) was inconsequential. Colony size and year sampled were the most important variables in these AICc models. These findings suggest that these ectoparasites do not enhance exposure of big brown bats to RV.

By analyzing echolocation calls recorded from free-flying bat returning to their roosts before dawn and those of known individuals in a captive setting, we tested for structural differences in the echolocation calls among maternity colonies. There were significant differences in the structure of the echolocation calls among the maternity colonies in both data sets, but the nature of these differences may depend on the setting in which the echolocation calls were produced. The echolocation calls of volant juveniles differed from those of adult females. Colony-specific echolocation calls could facilitate group and site recognition in microchiropteran bats.",
