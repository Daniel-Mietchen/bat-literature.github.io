            "abstractNote": "White-­nose syndrome (WNS) has devastated populations of hibernating bats in eastern North America, leading to emergency conservation listings for several species including the previously ubiquitous little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus). However, some bat populations near the epicenter of the WNS panzootic appear to be stabilizing after initial precipitous declines, which could reflect a selective immunogenetic sweep. To investigate the hypothesis that WNS exerts significant selection on the immunome of affected bat populations, we developed a novel, high-­throughput sequence capture assay targeting 138 adaptive, intrinsic, and innate immunity genes of putative adaptive significance, as well as their respective regulatory regions (~370 kbp of genomic sequence/individual). We used the assay to explore baseline immunogenetic variation in M. lucifugus and to investigate whether particular immune genes/variants are associated with WNS susceptibility. We also used our assay to detect 1,038 putatively neutral single nucleotide polymorphisms and characterize contemporary population structure, providing context for the identification of local immunogenetic adaptation. Sequence capture provided a cost-­effective, “all-­in-­one” assay to test for neutral genetic and immunogenetic structure and revealed fine-­scale, baseline immunogenetic differentiation between sampling sites <600 km apart. We identified functional immunogenetic variants in M. lucifugus associated with WNS susceptibility. This study lays the foundations for future investigations of rangewide immunogenetic adaptation to WNS in M. lucifugus and provides a blueprint for studies of evolutionary rescue in other host–pathogen systems.",

Squared Mahalanobis distance was used as a multivariate measure for amount of divergence, and squared Mahalanobis distance weighted by time was used as a measure for the rate of divergence. Estimates for the rates of divergence were found to be consistent with random walk hypothesis. Thus, the divergence in Myotis could be guided by random drift and mutations. The high dispersion in rate estimates suggests also a possible input of randomly ﬂuctuating selection. The highest rates were recorded for divergence between M. myotis–M. blythii species group and the other OTUs. Rates of divergence between the subspecies of M. blythii occur to be lesser than rates of divergence between the earlier diverged species, their divergence could probably be slowed down by stabilizing selection. Size-adjusted data appeared to be lesser then the initial data, and it can be concluded that both size and shape were involved in divergence of Myotis species. The skeletal characters in bats are known to be extremely conservative during long-term evolution, however, the possibility for random walk at short time interval implies that bat evolution is constrained rather ecologically and biomechanically than genetically or developmentally.",

Here we assessed the accuracy of PH for the reconstruction of 3D digital models of bat skulls by evaluating its potential for evolutionary morphology studies at interspecific (19 species) level. Its reliability was assessed against the performance of micro CT scan (µCT) and laser scan techniques (LS). We used 3D geometric morphometrics and comparative methods to quantify the amount of size and shape variation due to the scanning technique and assess the strength of the biological signal in relation to both the technique error and phylogenetic uncertainty. We found only minor variation among techniques. Levels of random error (repeatability and procrustes variance) were similar in all techniques and no systematic error was observed (as evidenced from principal component analysis). Similar levels of phylogenetic signal, allometries and correlations with ecological variables (frequency of maximum energy and bite force) were detected among techniques. Phylogenetic uncertainty interacted with technique error but without affecting the biological conclusions driven by the evolutionary analyses. Our study confirms the accuracy of PH for the reconstruction of challenging specimens. These results encourage the use of PH as a reliable and highly accessible tool for the study of macro evolutionary processes of small mammals.",

These species evolved towards increasing the size. One more species, M. dasycneme, which is phylogenetically, morphologically, and ecologically rather distant from these OTUs, also was studied for comparison with them. A set of 30 craniometric traits was studied for each of the OTUs using the quantitative genetics approaches. Phenotypic covariance matrices were used as proxies for additive genetic covariance matrices. The analysis has shown that multivariate divergence of the studied Myotis OTUs was governed by selection rather than by random drift and that these OTUs evolved in the direction close to the line of least evolutionary resistance. As overall size increases, the skull integration, respondability, and evolvability increase, while flexibility slightly decreases. Such a pattern can possibly be explained as a consequence of adaptation of M. blythii and especially M. myotis to prey on considerably large hard-shelled insects. A high cohesion of skull structures is needed for the effective functioning of their jaw apparatus. For Myotis bats with other foraging strategies (such as M. dasycneme that catches insects mainly using the claws of hind feet) this cohesion seems to be of lesser importance.",

            "abstractNote": "Ectoparasitic insects often exhibit female-biased sex ratios, a pattern usually explained by greater female longevity and the likelihood that smaller, more active males will disperse or be groomed off the host. Theory predicts that unbalanced sex ratios should favor males when resources are abundant and predictable, and when males are the dispersing sex. Sex ratios of streblid bat ﬂies were evaluated based on a large biodiversity survey in Venezuela–more than 25,000 bats representing 130 species were searched for ﬂies, yielding more than 36,500 bat ﬂies of 116 species. These samples allowed us to analyze sex ratios in 112 bat ﬂy metapopulations. Our results indicate that fully one-third of these metapopulations were signiﬁcantly male-biased. Traditional explanations for sexratio bias, such as sampling effects, unequal longevity between the sexes, and differential dispersal capability are refuted for bat ﬂies in favor of an alternative hypothesis—selective host grooming. Because host grooming is the principal cause of mortality for these slowreproducing parasites, and because females are larger than males and gravid for a signiﬁcant portion of their adult life, host grooming activity is more likely to kill or remove females than males. Incomplete understanding of population dynamics, such as mating behavior, dispersal, and reproductive success, cloud applications of male-biased sex ratios in bat ﬂies to support or refute theoretical predictions. Population studies of mating competition and sex-related dispersal dynamics of this male-dominated group should yield important insights into sex ratio theory.",

            "abstractNote": "Animal pigmentation is incredibly diverse, serving a variety of functions. However, the function of the pigmentation that surrounds the testes of some vertebrates is unknown. Why are the tissues surrounding the testes (scrotum, tunica vaginalis and/or tunica albuginea) melanized in some species but not others? We examined this question in bats, where there is extensive species-specific variation in the presence of darkly pigmented (melanized) tissues surrounding the male gonads, as well as diversity in their ecologies, mating systems, and physiologies. Using data from 136 species of bats, we found that melanin surrounding the testes and epididymis is associated with more exposed roosting sites (presumably with greater sun exposure- and UV radiation), and with the occurrence of long-term male sperm storage. These findings suggest that scrotal melanin may protect mature sperm from UV damage, and from oxidative damage in species with male sperm storage. We found no evidence of an association between group size or mating system with reproductive melanin, or that phylogeny explains the distribution of pigmentation. Although our study suggests that scrotal melanin may protect sperm, the mechanism remains unknown. We outline several avenues for future work on reproductive pigmentation aimed at investigating additional roles of reproductive melanization in male bats.",

More recently, this tick was reported in the Brazilian Amazon. Because some morphometric differences were observed between O. marinkellei larvae from Colombia and Brazil, it was proposed that further investigations were needed to assess whether the differences could be attributed to intra- or inter-specific polymorphism. Herein, we collected O. marinkellei specimens in the type locality of Colombia, in Brazil, and in a new locality in Nicaragua, expanding the distribution of the species to Nicaragua. Morphometric analysis of larvae and adults, corroborated by a principal component analysis (PCA), indicated that the Brazilian specimens were larger than specimens from Colombia and Nicaragua. Phylogenetic analysis inferred from the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene showed ticks from Colombia and Nicaragua more genetically related than any of them with ticks from Brazil, although ticks from the three countries grouped in a clade sister to a major clade containing sequences of various Neotropical Ornithodoros species. We concluded that ticks identified as O. marinkellei from Colombia, Nicaragua, and Brazil represent the same taxon, and that the genetic and morphological differences between them are likely to have a geographical bias. We redescribed the nymph of O. marinkellei, which has a vestigial hypostome, probably incompatible with blood feeding. We also report human infestation by O. marinkellei adults. As all reports of O. marinkellei adults have been from hot caves (temperature > 35 °C), this abiotic condition could be a limiting factor for the occurrence of this tick species.",

Later it was also registered from Argentina and recently included among the Brazilian tick fauna. In Brazil, this species is very aggressive to man, resulting in intense inﬂammatory response and pain. It is known only by the larval description and its morphology resembles that from other species currently included into the genus Carios, formerly classiﬁed into the subgenus Alectorobius, genus Ornithodoros. Here we describe adults and redescribe the larva of C. mimon, based on light and scanning electron microscopy. Remarks about its morphological similarity with other species of this genus are also discussed. Molecular analysis inferred from a portion of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial gene placed C. mimon in a cluster supported by maximal bootstrap value (100%) with other argasid species (mostly bat parasites in the New World), which have been classiﬁed into either the genus Ornithodoros or Carios, depending on the Argasidae classiﬁcation adopted by different authors.",

            "abstractNote": "Argasid ticks are a diverse group of acarines that parasitize numerous vertebrate hosts. Along with birds, bats serve as hosts for several argasid ticks, which are commonly found in bat caves. Argasid ticks have regained attention from tick taxonomists in recent decades, with a number of new species described in various zoogeographical regions. Nonetheless, studies on their ecology are still scarce. We conducted a 1-year longitudinal study to assess the presence of argasid ticks in a bat cave in the drylands of north-eastern Brazil and evaluate their possible response to abiotic factors. From July 2014 to June 2015, 490 ticks were collected (272 nymphs, 169 males and 49 females) in a cave chamber hosting a large colony of Pteronotus spp. bats, being relatively more frequent from July to December 2014. Adults were identified as Antricola guglielmonei, whereas nymphs were assigned to the genus Antricola. Almost all ticks (98%) were collected on the cave walls. Only 2% were on the ceiling and, surprisingly, no specimens were found on the floor and/or guano. Adults were usually clustered in the crevices and little mobile, whereas nymphs were dispersed and more active, moving over the walls or ceiling of the cave. Although present in most of the studied period, there was a significantly negative correlation between tick abundance and relatively humidity, and A. guglielmonei was more frequent during the dry season. Moreover, there was no evident correlation between the abundance of ticks and bats. Further long-term studies will be able to verify whether this pattern is repeated over time, and even whether other variables can influence the population dynamics of A. guglielmonei.",

Phylogenetic relationships of Eimeria species that parasitise bats and rodents can be related to the morphology of oocysts, independently from host range, suggesting that these species are derived from common ancestors. In the present study, we isolated a partial sequence of the Eimeria hessei 18S rRNA gene from the lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros), a European bat species. Droppings from lesser horseshoe bats were collected from 11 maternity roosts located in France that were positive for the presence of the parasite. Through morphological characterisation, the oocysts detected in the lesser horseshoe bat droppings were conﬁrmed to be E. hessei. The unique E. hessei sequence obtained through molecular analysis belonged to a clade that includes both rodent and bat Eimeria species. However, the E. hessei oocysts isolated from the bat droppings did not show morphological similarities to rodent Eimeria species.",

The combinations of linear and nonlinear parameters have resulted in an average error of 1.8%, improving the accuracy in 0.42%.

The pathogen’s spread is associated with the genetic population structure of a host (Myotis lucifugus). To understand the fine-scale neutral and immunogenetic variation among northern populations of M. lucifugus, we sampled 1142 individuals across the species’ northern range. We used genotypes at 11 microsatellite loci to reveal the genetic structure of, and directional gene flow among, populations to predict the likely future spread of the pathogen in the northwest and to estimate effective population size (Ne). We also pyrosequenced the DRB1-like exon 2 of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in 160 individuals to explore immunogenetic selection by WNS. We identified three major neutral genetic clusters: Eastern, Montane Cordillera (and adjacent sampling areas), and Haida Gwaii, with admixture at intermediate areas and significant substructure west of the prairies. Estimates of Ne were unexpectedly low (289–16 000). Haida Gwaii may provide temporary refuge from WNS, but the western mountain ranges are not barriers to its dispersal in M. lucifugus and are unlikely to slow its spread. Our major histocompatibility complex (MHC) data suggest potential selection by WNS on the MHC, but gene duplication limited the immunogenetic analyses.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding the relationship between the height of wind turbines and wildlife fatalities is important for informing and mitigating wildlife collisions as ever taller and denser arrays of wind turbines are erected across the landscape. We examined relationships between turbine height and fatalities of bats and swallows at 811 turbines in Ontario, Canada, ranging from 119 to 186 m tall. We accounted for cut-in speeds, operational mitigation, and taller turbines projecting carcasses farther from the turbine base than shorter turbines. Fatalities of hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus Palisot de Beauvois, 1796), silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans Le Conte, 1831), and big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus Palisot de Beauvois, 1796) increased with increased maximum blade height of turbines. In contrast, fatalities of little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus Le Conte, 1831) and eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis Müller, 1776) decreased with increased turbine height. Fatalities of purple martins (Progne subis Linnaeus, 1758) and tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor Vieillot, 1808) were higher at taller turbines than shorter turbines. However, fatalities of cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota Vieillot, 1817) and barn swallow (Hirundo rustica Linnaeus, 1758) were not associated with turbine height. Our results suggest that varying flight height among species may be one factor affecting collision risk.",

The surveys covered eight localities representing habitats from lowland agroforest and regenerating disturbed lowland rainforest at 780 m to mossy forest near the peak. We recorded 24 species, including one native shrew, one non-native shrew, five fruit bats, seven insectivorous bats, one monkey, six native rodents, two civets, and one pig. One species of Apomys is the newly described A. sierrae, and two species of Chrotomys are potentially undescribed species. Elevational patterns varied among mammals: bats were most diverse in the lowlands, native nonvolant small mammals had almost equal richness along the entire elevational transect, and most species of large mammals were present at all elevations. Bait attractiveness and diel activity pattern differed among native nonvolant small mammals: Apomys microdon and Rattus everetti were nocturnal and attracted to coconut baits, Chrotomys sp. 1 and 2 were mostly nocturnal and favored earthworms, Crocidura grayi showed no bait preference and was active during day and night, and A. sierrae showed no bait preference and was most active at night. The non-native Suncus murinus was restricted to highly disturbed areas at 780 m, whereas all native nonvolant small mammals were present in both degraded and undisturbed forest, supporting the hypothesis that nonnative small mammals are not successful in invading native habitats on oceanic islands when the native community of small mammals is diverse. We conclude that all three rainforest types at all elevations, including newly regenerating forest, provide important habitat for mammals on Mount Palali.",

            "abstractNote": "Background  Climate change has caused several alterations in the frequency, intensity, and severity of wildfires globally, particularly in the western United States. Wildfire can dramatically change the microclimate experienced by animals who inhabit fire-prone areas, with implications for energy expenditure, particularly for heterothermic species. Heterothermic mammals manage energy expenditure by selecting optimal microclimates and regulating their body temperature. Because bats frequently use torpor, they are a useful model organism to understand how wildfires affect heterothermic mammal communities. In 2020, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks were subjected to a severe wildfire that spanned 3636 ha within the boundaries of the park. We tracked eight California myotis (Myotis californicus) captured in Sequoia National Park to 22 roost sites in a gradient of burn severities in the summer from June–August 2021. We also quantified the torpor expression of bats on this post-burn landscape by measuring the roosting skin temperature of four M. californicus captured in a fire-affected site using temperature-sensitive radio telemetry.\nResults  M. californicus showed preference for taller and larger diameter trees with more exfoliating bark, although they did not show preference for whether individual trees were burned or unburned. At the roost habitat-scale, 21 out of 22 M. californicus roosts were within or < 5 m from the burn mosaic, despite availability of unburned landscape. M. californicus most frequently roosted in low-severity burned areas, as opposed to unburned or severely burned areas. Additionally, bats avoided areas without a canopy and used areas with taller trees in proportion to their availability. Myotis californicus used torpor during the coolest periods of the morning before sunrise and regularly used torpor in low-severity burn area roosts.\nConclusions  This research indicates that while fire may be beneficial to some bat species, those that are clutter-tolerant could be negatively affected by severe wildfires that cause major reductions in vegetative complexity. Bats in our study appear to use both habitat selection and torpor to manage their energy and water budgets. Protecting large diameter trees with exfoliating bark, like those used by bats in our study, could be key to promoting the persistence of M. californicus on this landscape as severe wildfire may reduce these roosts. In addition, restoring historical mixedseverity fire regimes, thereby creating a fire mosaic containing low severity burned areas, may be critical for maintaining both roosting and foraging habitat suitable for our study species in the fire-adapted coniferous forests of North America’s Sierra Nevada.",

Five species of trematodes, Plagiorchis (Plagiorchis) sp., Lecithodendrium (Lecithodendrium) linstowi Dollfus, 1931, Prosthodendrium (Prosthodendrium) sp., Pycnoporus heteroporus (Dujardin, 1845) and Parabascus semisquamosus (Braun, 1900), and one species of cestode, Hymenolepis pipistrelli López-Neyra, 1941, were found. The two bat populations harboured the same helminth species and showed the same trematode dominance, but the most important differences between the two helminth community structures were attributable to L. (L.) linstowi and H. pipistrelli. The mean species richness in the two localities was not significantly different. The mean number of helminth species per infected bat, mean infracommunity abundance and mean infracommunity diversity showed significant differences between both localities. The number of helminths per bat in both populations displayed an aggregated distribution. Results indicate that the different characteristics of the P. pipistrellus foraging area in both localities are important in determining the composition and structure of helminth communities in this bat species. This is the first study of a Palaearctic bat helminth community.",

In this review, previously unpublished data are presented in 20 species. Terrestrial mammals were taken into consideration, both the native and introduced. Altogether, 156 species occurring in the region concerned were included. The karyotype was studied in 109 of these species in Turkey, in most other species data are available from other geographic regions, and only three species remain unstudied cytogenetically. Intraspecific chromosomal variation (polymorphism or polytypy) was reported in 22 species. A karyotype different from the findings made in other regions was reported in Turkish populations of 17 species. Possible future directions of the cytogenetic investigations of mammals in the region are proposed.",

Throughout the 19-years-long monitoring period, a total of 5135 Rhinolophus hipposideros were counted in maternity roost, with a mean of 273 (SD = 198.1) per year (mean Piedmont = 73, SD = 85.9; mean Liguria = 200, SD = 164.6). The population analysis model shows a significant overall gradient of 1.047, which corresponds to an average annual increase of 4.7 % over the period considered. The analysis suggests that in the study area, the reproductive population of Rhinolophus hipposideros monitored in the maternity roost has increased throughout the period from 2000-2018, with large increases after 2010 and different trends occurring in the two regions considered, including a significant moderate increase in Liguria and a stable trend in Piedmont. The results agreed with the recently observed trends in other European countries for this species.",

            "abstractNote": "Forest managers are increasingly expected to incorporate biodiversity objectives within forest landscapes devoted to timber production. However, data on which to base management recommendations for bats within these systems are limited. Although the red bat (Lasiurus borealis) is a widespread and common species in temperate forests of North America, little is known of its ecology within intensively managed pine (Pinus spp.) forests of the southeastern United States. Diurnal roost sites of red bats may be limiting on industrial pine forests due to a lack of large hardwoods within managed stands. Therefore, we investigated selection of day roosts by red bats at multiple spatial scales during June–September 2000 and May–August 2001 in an intensively managed pine landscape in east-central Mississippi, USA. We captured bats using 4-tier mist nets placed over water and attached 0.47–0.54 g radiotransmitters to captured red bats (n ¼ 46). We located day roosts of red bats (n ¼ 141 roosts of 27 bats) for the life of the transmitters. Red bats roosted in 16 species of hardwood trees (70% of day roosts) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda; 30% of day roosts). In contrast to other studies in the southeastern United States, red bats roosted in pine trees and in midstory hardwood trees. Within thinned pine stands, red bats tended to prefer roost trees with a denser subcanopy and higher basal area as compared to random sites. Stand-level characteristics appeared more important than individual tree characteristics in choice of diurnal roosts. Except for adult males, logistic regression models of roost sites of red bats had high (!79%) correct classiﬁcation rates. Day roost site requirements of red bats may exhibit greater plasticity than previously thought. On our study area, intensive forest management appears compatible with diurnal roost needs of this species.",

In these landscapes, water occurs in numerous linear ditches and several small ponds (heliponds), used by helicopters for the suppression of forest ﬁres. Changes to the physical structure of water sources may be important to bats that use these sources for drinking and foraging. Therefore, we examined bat activity in a managed pine landscape and an adjacent natural wetland in relation to water source type (heliponds, ditches, and natural wetland) and insect abundance. We sampled bat activity using remote acoustic detectors; we sampled insects using passive traps. Insect abundance did not differ among water source types. Bat activity was most concentrated at modiﬁed water sources within the managed pine landscape (heliponds and ditches). Feeding activity was highest at heliponds. Heliponds and ditches were important sources of open water and insect prey for bats in the managed pine forest landscape. We suggest management for bats in similar forest landscapes should include maintenance of open and accessible water sources such as heliponds.",

Here, we document changes in the structure of bat assemblages among secondary successional stages of a neotropical dry forest. We speciﬁcally focused on the speciose phyllostomid bat family, comprising most of the foraging guilds found among neotropical bats, including nectarivores and frugivores that play important roles in processes of plant reproduction and forest regeneration. To investigate bat species richness, diversity and abundance during successionnal processes, we mist-netted bat assemblages in 12 sites belonging to 4 different successional stages, namely pastures (0 yrs), early (3–5 yrs), intermediate (8–12 yrs) and late successional stage (>50 yrs). A capture effort of 142 nights using ﬁve mist-nets per night yielded 606 phyllostomid bats belonging to 16 species. Late stage was the most speciose sustaining all species found in the study (16 species against 9 for early and intermediate stages and 4 in pastures), and was the only environment where rare species occurred. Species found within any one successional stage were a combination of species found at the previous stage plus additional ones. This additive pattern appeared to be driven by the natural abundance of species, as the abundant species were found across more succesisonal stages than rarer species. Bats were signiﬁcantly less speciose and less abundant in pastures, regardless of the foraging guild. Bat diversity and abundance did not differ signiﬁcantly among early, intermediate and late stages. However, nectarivores were more abundant in early compared to late stage, probably as a consequence of differences in patterns of food availability. We conclude that areas of forest, recognized as late stage in our study, are the most important reservoirs of species richness. Secondary vegetation also contains diverse bat assemblages, while pastures only harbour a few abundant and vagile species occasionally crossing this habitat. We suggest that land-use regulations in this region focus on maintaining connectivity of a mosaic of areas of secondary and mature vegetation to insure the conservation of bat diversity as well as their important ecological interactions.",

            "abstractNote": "The ability to fully evaluate potential relationships between forest management and bats is limited without information from relevant spatial scales. Further, knowledge of bat ecology in intensively managed forests is fairly limited even though these forests are a substantial portion of the forested landscape in the southeastern U.S. Therefore, we used occupancy models to examine inﬂuence of small-scale vegetation characteristics and large-scale spatial features on foraging patterns of bats within 6 managed-pine (Pinus spp.) forest landscapes in the southeastern U.S. Coastal Plain. We conducted repeated acoustic surveys to determine species presence/non-detection and evaluated a priori models relating detection probability and occupancy to site- and landscape-level metrics for 6 species/genera. Detection of big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) and eastern red (Lasiurus borealis)/Seminole (L. seminolus) bats (eastern red and Seminole bats combined) decreased with increasing basal area, and detection of big brown and Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) increased over the summer sampling period. Relationships between occupancy and habitat metrics were species-speciﬁc but consistent with previous studies. Occupancy for most bat species was lower at sampling sites with higher vegetation clutter and higher basal area. In contrast to most previous studies, occupancy of all bat species investigated was unrelated to or negatively inﬂuenced by distance to water. Although site- and landscape-level features inﬂuenced occupancy, our results indicate that site-speciﬁc features (vegetation clutter and basal area) inﬂuenced most species. Therefore, stand-level management activities that decrease vegetation structure, such as thinning intermediate-aged stands and/or controlling midstory vegetation (e.g., ﬁre or herbicide applications), likely will maintain or increase suitability of managed pine forest stands and landscapes for many bat species in the southeastern Coastal Plain. The forest mosaics that we sampled, consisting primarily of managed pine stands intermingled with non-production habitat types, supported a large proportion of the bat community associated with forests of the Coastal Plain which suggests the compatibility of timber production and bat conservation objectives.",

            "abstractNote": "Across the Southeastern U.S., including the Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee, prescribed ﬁre and overstory thinning are being used to restore areas of closed-canopy hardwood forest to open woodland and savanna. We used acoustic recording of bat echolocation call sequences to examine bat activity (relative use of an area for foraging) in hardwood forest stands subject to 4 prescribed ﬁre and residual basal area treatments (spring prescribed ﬁre with woodland [SpW] and savanna [SpS] residual basal areas, and fall prescribed ﬁre with woodland [FaW] and savanna [FaS]) basal areas, as well as untreated controls, during summer of 2013 and 2014. When possible, we classiﬁed recorded echolocation call sequences to species using automated identiﬁcation software (SonobatTM 3.1.4, SonoBatTM Inc., Arcata, California). To minimize errors in species classiﬁcation of recorded bat passes, we combined similar species in groups based on call characteristics prior to conducting analyses. Total bat activity (P 6 0.001), as well as LABO/NYHU (eastern red bat [Lasiurus borealis] and evening bat [Nycticeius humeralis]; P = 0.001), EPFU/LANO (big brown bat [Eptesicus fuscus] and silver-haired bat [Lasionycteris noctivagans]; P 6 0.001), PESU (tricolored bat [Perimyotis subﬂavus]; P = 0.001), and LACI (hoary bat [Lasiurus cinereus]; P = 0.005) activity was generally higher in SpS and FaS stands, where overstory basal area was lower, than in control, SpW, and FaW stands, where overstory basal area was higher (P 6 0.001). Our results suggest these treatments reduce clutter (physical obstructions to ﬂight and foraging including foliage, branches, and stems), leading to improved foraging conditions for bats, particularly larger bodied species with lower call frequencies that are adapted to ﬂy and forage in open conditions. We found no evidence nocturnal ﬂying insect prey abundance or biomass inﬂuenced activity of bats in treatment stands, indicating clutter is more important than prey availability in determining habitat use by bats in this system. Our study provides support for continued use of prescribed ﬁre and overstory thinning to restore hardwood forest to woodland and savanna and as a strategy to maintain and enhance habitat for forest bats in the Southeastern U.S.",

Despite the ubiquity of small clearings in fragmented Amazonian landscapes, most fragmentation research has focused on the effects of large-scale deforestation, leading to a poor understanding of the impacts of smaller barriers on Amazonian vertebrates. We capitalized on the periodical re-isolation of experimental forest fragments at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in the Central Amazon as a before-after-control-impact experiment to investigate the short-term effects of small clearings on bat assemblages. Over the course of three years we sampled six control sites in continuous forest, the interiors and edges of eight forest fragments as well as eight sites in the surrounding matrix. Sampling took place both before and after the experimental manipulation (clearing of a 100 m wide strip of regrowth around each fragment), resulting in $4000 bat captures. Species were classiﬁed as old-growth specialists and habitat generalists according to their habitat afﬁnities and a joint species distribution modeling framework was used to investigate the effect of fragment re-isolation on species occupancy. Following fragment re-isolation, species richness declined in all habitats other than fragment edges and, although responses were idiosyncratic, this decline was more pronounced for forest specialist than for generalist species. Additionally, fragment re-isolation led to a reduction in the similarity between assemblages in modiﬁed habitats (fragment interiors, edges and matrix) and continuous forest. Sampling of controls in continuous forest both prior to and after reisolation revealed that much of the variation in bat species occupancy between sampling periods did not arise from fragment re-isolation but rather reﬂected natural spatiotemporal variability. This emphasizes the need to sample experimental controls both before and after experimental manipulation and suggests caution in the interpretation of results from studies in which the effects of habitat transformations are assessed based solely on data collected using space-for-time substitution approaches.",

Federal guidelines generally do not require private landowners to search for endangered species before conducting forest management activities. Because private lands make up 85% of Indiana’s forests, recommendations by professional foresters can inﬂuence a large proportion of the management decisions made on Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) habitat in the state. Thus, we wanted to determine what factors lead professional foresters in Indiana to adopt management strategies that beneﬁt bat conservation. We conducted an online survey of Indiana consultant and state foresters to address two main objectives: (1) to assess forester understanding of guidelines for adequate bat habitat, and (2) to identify the factors that inﬂuence professional forester intention to manage forests to improve bat habitat quality. For a subset of survey respondents, we also determined whether forester intent to manage for Indiana bat habitat translated to on-the-ground behavior via an assessment of their stands marked for single-tree selection harvest. We found that most respondents knew some of the forest management guidelines for the Indiana bat, but few were familiar with all guidelines. Through structural equation modeling, we determined that intention to manage forests for the Indiana bat was inﬂuenced most by whether foresters believed following the guidelines would strongly inﬂuence the conservation of the species. We found a diﬀerence in the relative strength (path loading) of this factor between government and consultant foresters. We assessed the management decisions of a subsample of our survey respondents and found that respondent’s decisions aligned with their intention to maintain or create Indiana bat habitat. We suggest two strategies can be employed to improve the habitat management occurring on private lands in Indiana: (1) increasing forester knowledge of federal guidelines and (2) providing evidence to foresters that these guidelines directly contribute to Indiana bat conservation.",

Abiotic parameters and biotic communities were monitored in a tropical dry forest (TDF) landscape on the coast of Jalisco, Mexico after two major events: Hurricanes Jova (2011) and Patricia (2015). Three zones (1-upper, 2-middle and 3-lower basin) adjacent to the TDF were analyzed along the Cuitzmala River catchment areas before and after the events. We used the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as a proxy for vegetation greenness and the diversity index of a small mammal community of rodents and bats as indicators of terrestrial habitat quality, and Fecal Coliform (FC), Fecal Enterococci (FE), and Electrical Conductivity (EC) as indicators of the river-water condition. During the years of hurricanes (2011 and 2015) there was a decrease in the EVI and small mammal diversity, as well as changes in the concentration of FC, FE and EC. The main eﬀects associated with the two hurricanes were observed in the lower basin where hurricanes made landfall and the forest had been converted to other land uses. The EVI, communities of small mammals, and abiotic and biotic water conditions were responsive to the eﬀects of hurricanes and can thus be useful for a long-term ecological monitoring program at the basin scale. This program would allow a faster evaluation and response to future extreme meteorological events. Our results could be implemented through the Urban and Environmental Plans at the state level (Ordenamiento Territorial del Estado de Jalisco), through the regulation of sustainable agricultural and livestock techniques, and by educating local populations of the eﬀects of extreme meteorological events.",

Summer day-roost sites are critical resources for bats, so conserving roost sites is a focus of many bat conservation plans. Studies quantifying day-roost characteristics typically focus on female bats due to their much stronger inﬂuence on reproductive success, but large areas of species’ ranges can be occupied predominantly by male bats due to sexual segregation. We used VHF telemetry to identify and characterize summer day-roost selection by male northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in South Dakota, USA. We tracked 18 bats to 43 tree roosts and used an information-theoretic approach to determine the relative importance of tree- and plot-level characteristics for roost site selection. Bats selected roost trees that were larger in diameter, more decayed, and under denser canopy than other trees available on the landscape. Much like studies of female northern long-eared bats have shown, protecting large-diameter snags within intact forest is important for the conservation of male northern long-eared bats. Unlike female-speciﬁc studies, however, many roosts in our study (39.5%) were located in short (≤3 m) snags. Protecting short snags may be a low-risk, high-reward strategy for conservation of resources important to male northern long-eared bats. Other tree-roosting bat species in ﬁre-prone forests may beneﬁt from forest management practices that promote these tree characteristics, particularly in high-elevation areas where populations largely consist of males.",

Abundance of prey likely has a strong influence on habitat use in forest landscapes as well. Therefore, we simultaneously examined influence of insect abundance and vegetation characteristics on bat site-occupancy across 3 pine (Pinus spp.)-dominated landscapes within the southeastern U. S. Coastal Plain. We conducted acoustic surveys and used Akaike’s Information Criterion to evaluate plausibility of occupancy and detection models that incorporated vegetation- and insect-related factors. Results indicate that bat site-occupancy was better explained by a combination of vegetation characteristics and insect abundance than either separately, and vegetation structure has a stronger influence than prey abundance. Additionally, our data generally suggest insect taxon is more influential in predicting occupancy than insect size.

Our research investigated the relationship between insects and forest management practices in the Ozark Na­ tional Forest in Arkansas. We looked at the differences in biomass, abundance, and diversity of insects in 30 treatment stands with varying burn frequencies. Twelve of these stands were burned and mechanically thinned, 12 were only burned, and 6 were untreated. The burn frequencies of these stands range from being burned 0–4 times from 2007 to 2018. We deployed blacklight traps in each of the stands every month from mid-March to mid-November in 2019 to assess nocturnal bat prey. Over 30,070 insects were collected, with Lepidoptera being the most abundant order. Insects were dried, weighed, and identified for diversity metrics. We used multi-model selection and AICc to find the top models from a series of linear mixed effects models to determine the best forest management strategies for bat prey. Total nocturnal, aerial insect biomass, Lepidoptera biomass, and Macro­ heterocera abundance was lower in thinned stands. However, it is unclear if it is the removal of Lepidoptera tree hosts or changes to bat foraging activity that drove this relationship. Stands burned at high frequencies had a higher abundance of Coleoptera. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis was not supported with regards to Lepidoptera diversity and burn frequency. Burning at high frequencies (4 times per 12 years) and not thinning may be the best strategy for maximizing nocturnal Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, respectively.",

            "abstractNote": "Landscape management is a key tool for wildlife conservation. This is especially important in protected areas, where conservation, local resource harvesting such as timber harvesting, and public accessibility are potentially conflicting needs that eventually influence wildlife ecology and behaviour. We studied the spatial behaviour of a forest specialist, the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus), and tested how this species copes with: i) habitat structure shaped by forest management practices (past coppice, high forest and conifer plantations), and ii) the occurrence of gaps within the forest matrix opened by people to make space for pastures and hiking trails. We radio-tagged 17 bats for 3 consecutive nights each, to track their movements in a beech-dominated forest landscape in central Italy, and assessed their spatial behaviour in relation to the landscape by adopting two different approaches. First, we applied habitat selection analyses to test whether specific land use classes were disproportionately used by bats over land class availability within the landscape. Second, we related individualbased foraging and commuting locations to landscape structure, predicting activity-specific probabilities in response to land use composition and spatial patterning. Brown long-eared bats most preferred high forest stands, whereas all other land classes were least preferred such as coppice, conifer stands, and pastures. Pre­ dictive models indicate that commuting and foraging, besides being both more likely to occur within high forest, were differently affected by landscape features. Commuting long-eared bats flew along and closer to trails and open areas compared to random sites, while such habitat features were barely used for foraging. On such bases, due to the great importance of high forest, we highlight that long time may be needed to functionally convert coppice into high forest, and that previous forest management may have long-lasting effects on forest-specialist taxa. Similarly, the use of non-native conifers, once favoured for their high timber productivity, should be avoided within protected areas aiming at conserving forest bats. Trails and clearings might also be planned strategically to exploit their potential role of ecological corridor between core forest areas and favour bat commuting.",

            "abstractNote": "Forest ecosystems are fundamental to the conservation of global biodiversity and human wellbeing, hosting high numbers of species worldwide, and providing essential regulatory, provisioning, and cultural ecosystem services. The increasing impact of drivers of environmental changes such as climate change and biological invasions endangers forests, often acting synergically with forest pests, whose effects are exacerbated. Within this context, forest bats may represent key ecosystem service providers by consuming pests such as defoliating and fruitdamaging arthropods, yet their actual role has been so far neglected. Here we pursued the hypothesis that forest bats will be important suppressors of agroforestry pest insects. We analysed the diet of two forest spe­ cialists, Barbastella barbastellus and Plecotus auritus, occurring in syntopy in beech forests of Central Italy, by adopting molecular tools. The diet of the two bat species differed significantly: only 52 out of 71 and 69 prey taxa identified in the diet of B. barbastellus and P. auritus, respectively, were shared between the two bat species. Individual bats preyed, on average, upon 10 insect taxa, and pests were especially frequent in the diet of P. auritus (up to 85% of prey eaten by an individual bat). Such pests included both agricultural and forestdamaging insects, some of which pose serious threats to agroforestry systems. This highlights the importance of preserving animal diversity in forests for the benefit of this ecosystem type as well as of the surrounding habitats, such as farmland.",

            "abstractNote": "Forests provide crucial foraging and roosting habitat to many bat species, and the gradual loss of forests is among the principal threats to global bat diversity. Forests that persist in the face of land use change are those that are managed for a variety of uses, including recreation, hunting, timber production, and wildlife conservation. Thus, understanding how bats respond to management is imperative to their conservation. We used radio telemetry to study the roosting and foraging behaviors of male and female eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis). These forestdependent bats roost in the foliage of live trees and are declining across their range. We tracked 26 bats (7 males and 18 females; one female was tracked twice) from May to August 2017–2019 in two state forests in south-central Indiana, USA. We estimated space use with 95% kernel density estimates and used generalized linear and linear mixed models to assess resource selection and use at three levels: population-level foraging selection, individual-level foraging use, and population-level roost selection. On average, eastern red bats foraged over a relatively small area (81 ha) and traveled a maximum distance of 1404 m from their roosts. The eastern red bat population foraged near maintained openings, recent regeneration openings, roads, and ponds within the study area. Within their foraging ranges, eastern red bats spent more time foraging near roads, ponds, and ridges. Eastern red bats roosted near maintained openings, recent regeneration openings, and ponds, switching roosts every two days. Roost trees were larger than random trees and were in plots containing fewer live stems than random plots. Together, these results reveal that some of the most important landscape features for eastern red bats are linear corridors (e.g., roads or ridgetops), forest openings (e.g., maintained openings and recent regeneration openings), perennial sources of water (e.g., ponds), and large trees. Overall, eastern red bats exhibited strong selection for managed portions of the forest, suggesting they can coexist with and likely benefit from timber management. When considering habitat for eastern red bats in central hardwood forests, we recommend land managers work to maintain large tracts of mature (>90 years old) forest, interspersed with young regeneration openings and provisioned with perennial water sources (e.g., ponds).",

            "abstractNote": "Conifer plantations are a major land use globally and provide a range of social, economic and environmental benefits, particularly the provision of timber. There is a growing interest in alternative forestry techniques, such as irregular silviculture, to create more sustainable and resilient plantations in response to climate change. Plantations are often considered poor for bats due to limited structural diversity. Irregular forestry increases structural diversity and reduces growing stocks, with potentially positive effects on bats, but this remains poorly understood in conifer plantations. At two estates in south-west Britain, we specifically tested whether bat species richness and activity respond to (1) the surrounding landscape cover types (2) habitat structure within irregular stands and (3) increasing progress along the transformation continuum in three continuous cover forestry stands undergoing transformation including irregular high forest. Stands further progressed along the transformation continuum had lower basal area, higher mean tree diameter, higher levels of fallen deadwood and greater canopy cover of broadleaf trees. A total of 13 species of bat, equivalent to 76% of the UK resident species were recorded. The activity of six species was significantly influenced by the proportion of four land use types (two positive and two negative associations with conifer woodland, one positive and one negative association with broadleaved woodland, two positive associations with improved grassland and two negative associations with arable) in the surrounding landscape at three spatial scales (500 m, 1500 m and 3000 m around each survey plot). Four species showed significant positive associations with habitat structural features including larger mean tree diameter, greater canopy openness, higher vertical structural complexity, higher quantities of standing and fallen dead­ wood, and higher canopy cover of broadleaved trees. Many of these habitat features were more prevalent in stands further progressed towards irregular high forest. We did not detect any significant differences in bat species richness or activity levels between the three stand stages, except for Plecotus auritus/austriacus which had higher activity in the Stage 3 stand compared to Stage 2, as the limited replication of our study may have precluded detection of any differences. Our study helps inform us on how bats populations respond to novel management of conifer plantations. Further research to determine thresholds for deadwood and broadleaved trees to further support bats in plantations would be beneficial.",

            "abstractNote": "Resting-site selection involves some of the most important decisions made by organisms. For forest-dwelling bats, where to roost influences not only resting but also many other activities that affect fitness such as raising young, thermoregulation, communication, and evasion of predators. Across much of North America, many bats roost in trees during summer and hibernate in caves during winter and as such, most of the focus on roosting ecology and forest management has been during summer. Along much of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains in the southern portion of North America, winters are relatively warm, few caves exist, and many bat species are active. Herein, we described the tree-roosting ecology of Northern long-eared bats (Myotis septentrionalis) in Louisiana in both summer and winter, examined roost selection, compared selection seasonally, and compared various aspects of roosting ecology in Louisiana to other areas across North America. We found that in Louisiana M. septentrionalis roosted primarily in pine trees and found no significant differences in roosting characteristics between sexes. Year-round, bats preferred roosts in trees in more advanced stages of decay than available trees. In summer, bats selected for plot level characteristics such as higher density of trees that were large and in more advanced stages of decay. In contrast, in winter, bats selected for tree characteristics such as those with taller, greater diameter and with more exfoliating bark. Comparisons with 21 other studies across North America indicated variation in selected roost characteristics among regions. These results highlight variability in roost selection through space and time and suggest that management strategies that are tailored to specific sites may be most effective for enhancing roosting opportunities of M. septentrionalis and ultimately the conservation of this species.",

            "abstractNote": "Research Highlights: Seasonal variation in environmental conditions coinciding with reproductive and energetic demands might result in seasonal differences in species-speciﬁc habitat use. We studied a winter assemblage of insectivorous bats and found that species acted as habitat generalists during winter compared to expectations based on the summer active season. Background and Objectives: In temperate regions, seasonal ﬂuctuations in resource availability might restructure local bat assemblages. Initially perceived to only hibernate or migrate to avoid adverse winter conditions, temperate insectivorous bats appear to also employ intermediate overwintering strategies, as a growing body of literature suggests that winter activity is quite prevalent and even common in some lower latitude areas. However, to date, most studies have exclusively assessed habitat associations during summer. Because habitat use during summer is strongly inﬂuenced by reproduction, we hypothesized that habitat associations might differ during the non-reproductive winter period. We used acoustic monitoring to assess the habitat associations of bats across a managed pine landscape in the southeastern United States. Materials and Methods: During the winters of 2018 and 2019, we deployed acoustic detectors at 72 unique locations to monitor bat activity and characterized vegetation conditions at two scales (microhabitat and landscape). We used linear mixed models to characterize species-speciﬁc activity patterns associated with different vegetation conditions. Results: We found little evidence of different activity patterns during winter. The activity of three species (hoary bat: Lasiurus cinereus; southeastern myotis: Myotis austroriparius; and tricolored bat: Perimyotis subﬂavus) was not related to vegetation variables and only modest relationships were evident for four other species/groups (big brown bat: Eptesicus fuscus; eastern red bat: L. borealis; Seminole bat: L. seminolus; evening bat: Nycticeius humeralis; and Brazilian free-tailed bat: Tadarida brasiliensis). Conclusions: During winter, the bats in our study were active across the landscape in various cover types, suggesting that they do not exhibit the same habitat associations as in summer. Therefore, seasonal differences in distributions and habitat associations of bat populations need to be considered so that effective management strategies can be devised that help conserve bats year round.",

Empirical data on resource selection within the region is limited, likely hindering management of these coastal forests. Our objectives were to determine roosting home range size, selection of day-roost tree species, second- and third-order roosting habitat selection, and to quantify the overall availability of resources in the surrounding landscape. We found core and peripheral roosting home range estimates were large, yet similar to observations from other areas of contiguous forests. Prior to juvenile volancy, female northern long-eared bats appear to select red maple (Acer rubrum), water ash (Fraxinus caroliniana), and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) as day-roosts, but then use sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciﬂua), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) after juvenile volancy. At the second-order spatial scale, roosting home ranges were associated with woody wetlands farther from anthropogenic development and open water. However, within the third-order scale, northern long-eared bats were associated with undeveloped woody wetlands and upland forests, areas containing shorter trees and occurring proximal to open water. Peripheral and core areas were predicted to comprise approximately 20% of the local landscape. Our results show that complex and large tracts of woody wetlands juxtaposed with upland forests in this part of the Coastal Plain may be important for northern long-eared bats locally, results largely consistent with species management efforts in eastern North America.",

            "abstractNote": "The eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis Müller, 1776) is a widespread species that roosts in evergreen or dead foliage suspended in trees during winter but retreats to leaf litter during colder periods. Roosting in leaf litter by eastern red bats makes them vulnerable to prescribed ﬁres in winter. Using radio telemetry, we tracked 33 male eastern red bats to 101 winter (November–February) roosts and quantiﬁed roost locations, habitat surrounding roosts, and landscape attributes of roost locations. When roosting in trees, bats preferred oaks but generally avoided other tree species; they used pines in proportion to their availability. During colder periods, bats retreated to roosts in leaf litter where 21% suffered mortality either from predation/scavenging or unknown causes while roosting on the ground. Models of roost selection indicated that southerly aspect was the most important factor determining roost selection, and both tree- and leaf-litter roosts were predominately (≥94%) on upper south-facing slopes. Prescribed burning in late morning/early afternoon on clear days when temperatures under leaf litter are warmest in winter could reduce potential mortality by allowing faster arousal time for hibernating bats.",

Efforts to quantify these patterns have included analyses of interpulse intervals, sonar sound groups, and changes in individual signal parameters such as duration or frequency. Here, the similarity in temporal structure between trains of biosonar pulses is assessed. The spike train similarity space (SSIMS) algorithm, originally designed for neural activity pattern analysis, was applied to determine which features of the environment inﬂuence temporal patterning of pulses emitted by ﬂying big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus. In these laboratory experiments, bats ﬂew down a ﬂight corridor through an obstacle array. The corridor varied in width (100, 70, or 40 cm) and shape (straight or curved). Using a relational point-process framework, SSIMS was able to discriminate between echolocation call sequences recorded from ﬂights in each of the corridor widths. SSIMS was also able to tell the difference between pulse trains recorded during ﬂights where corridor shape through the obstacle array matched the previous trials (ﬁxed, or expected) as opposed to those recorded from ﬂights with randomized corridor shape (variable, or unexpected), but only for the ﬂight path shape in which the bats had previous training. The results show that experience inﬂuences the temporal patterns with which bats emit their echolocation calls. It is demonstrated that obstacle proximity to the bat affects call patterns more dramatically than ﬂight path shape.",

            "abstractNote": "Acoustic communication signals are inevitably challenged by ambient noise. In response to noise, many animals adjust their calls to maintain signal detectability. However, the mechanisms by which the auditory system adapts to the adjusted pulses are unclear. Our previous study revealed that the echolocating bat, Hipposideros pratti, increased its pulse intensity in the presence of background white noise. In vivo singleneuron recording demonstrated that the auditory midbrain neurons tuned to the second harmonic (H2 neurons) increased their minimal threshold (MT) to a similar degree as the increment of pulse intensity in the presence of the background noise. Furthermore, the H2 neurons exhibited consistent spike rates at their best amplitudes and sharper intensity tuning with background white noise compared with silent conditions. The previous data indicated that sound intensity analysis by auditory midbrain neurons was adapted to the increased pulse intensity in the same noise condition. This study further examined the echolocation pulse frequency and frequency analysis of auditory midbrain neurons with noise conditions. The data revealed that H. pratti did not shift the resting frequency in the presence of background noise. The auditory midbrain neuronal frequency analysis highly linked to processing the resting frequency with the presence of noise by presenting the constant best frequency (BF), frequency sensitivity, and frequency selectivity. Thus, our results suggested that auditory midbrain neuronal responses in background white noise are adapted to process echolocation pulses in the noise conditions.",

            "abstractNote": "The genus Scotophilus contains 21 currently recognized species ranging throughout Africa and Southeast Asia. Among the 13 species recognized from continental Africa, systematic relationships remain poorly understood. Taxonomic uncertainty regarding names, suggestions of polytypic species complexes, and undescribed cryptic diversity all contribute to the current confusion. To gain insights into the systematics of this group, we inferred single locus and multi-locus phylogenies and conducted lineage delimitation analyses using seven unlinked genes for specimens from across Africa. Recent collections from Kenya allowed us to carry out population-level analyses for the diverse assemblage of East African Scotophilus. Multi-locus coalescent delimitation methods indicated strong support for three recently named lineages thought to be restricted to Kenya and Tanzania; it also uncovered two new distinctive lineages at present known only from Kenya. Subsequent taxonomic assessments that integrate these genetic data with phenotypic, distributional, and/or ecological traits are needed to establish these lineages as valid species. Nevertheless, as many as 15 Scotophilus species may occur in continental Africa, 10 of these in Kenya alone. Our analysis highlights the importance of population-level surveys for the detection of cryptic diversity in understudied regions such as the Afrotropics.",

The effects of the replacement of native vegetation with commercial plantations on the functional and phylogenetic diversity of bat assemblages remain understudied, and most studies have focused exclusively on the taxonomic component of diversity. Here, we investigate how the replacement of natural savannahs by acacia plantations affects the α- and β-diversity of bat assemblages. We sampled bats, using mist-nets at ground level, in natural forest, savannah areas and acacia plantations, in the Lavrados de Roraima in the northern Brazilian Amazon. Our results show that, in general, acacia is less diverse than native forests in terms of taxonomic and functional diversity, and is also less taxonomically diverse than the savannah matrix which it substitutes. The observed patterns of α- and β-diversity found in the present study are in large part driven by the superabundance of one generalist and opportunistic species, Carollia perspicillata, in the acacia plantations. Taken together, our results show that the replacement of areas of natural savannah by acacia plantations causes a regional loss in diversity across all diversity dimensions: taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic. However, further studies are required to fully understand the ecological and conservation implications of this landscape change.",

            "abstractNote": "Social feedback plays an important role in human language development and in the vocal ontogeny of non-human animals. A special form of vocal feedback in humans, infant-directed speech – or motherese – facilitates language learning and is socially beneﬁcial by increasing attention and arousal in the child. It is characterized by high pitch, expanded intonation contours and slower speech tempo. Furthermore, the vocal timbre (i.e., “color” of voice) of motherese differs from the timbre of adult-directed speech. In animals, pup-directed vocalizations are very common, especially in females. But so far there is hardly any research on whether there is a similar phenomenon as motherese in animal vocalizations. The greater sac-winged bat, Saccopteryx bilineata, is a vocal production learner with a large vocal repertoire that is acquired during ontogeny. We compared acoustic features between female pup-directed and adultdirected vocalizations and demonstrated that they differed in timbre and peak frequency. Furthermore, we described pup-directed vocalizations of adult males. During the ontogenetic period when pups’ isolation calls (ICs) (used to solicit maternal care) are converging toward each other to form a group signature, adult males also produce ICs. Pups’ ICs are acoustically more similar to those of males from the same social group than to other males. In conclusion, our novel ﬁndings indicate that parentoffspring communication in bats is more complex and multifaceted than previously thought, with female pup-directed vocalizations reminiscent of human motherese and male pup-directed vocalizations that may facilitate the transmission of a vocal signature across generations.",

            "abstractNote": "Habitat alteration for agriculture can negatively affect wildlife physiology and health by decreasing diet diversity and increasing exposure to agrochemicals for animals foraging in altered landscapes. Such negative effects may be mediated by the disruption of the gut microbiota (termed dysbiosis), yet evidence for associations between habitat alteration, wildlife health, and the gut microbiota remains scarce. We examine the association between management intensity of banana plantations and both the body condition and gut microbiota composition of nectar-feeding bats\n              Glossophaga soricina\n              , which commonly forage within banana plantations across Latin America. We captured and measured 196 bats across conventional monocultures, organic plantations, and natural forests in Costa Rica, and quantified gut microbiome bacterial phylogenetic diversity using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We found that gut microbiota from bats foraging in conventional monocultures were overall less phylogenetically diverse than those from bats foraging in organic plantations or natural forests, both of which were characterized by diverse bacterial assemblages and individualized microbiota. Despite lower diversity, co-occurrence network complexity was higher in conventional monocultures, potentially indicating altered microbial interactions in agricultural landscapes. Bats from both organic and conventional plantations tended to be larger and heavier than their forest counterparts, reflecting the higher food supply. Overall, our study reveals that whilst both conventional monocultures and organic plantations provide a reliable food source for bats, conventional monocultures are associated with less diverse and potentially dysbiotic microbiota, whilst organic plantations promote diverse and individualized gut microbiota akin to their natural forest-foraging counterparts. Whilst the long-term negative effects of anthropogenically-altered microbiota are unclear, our study provides further evidence from a novel perspective that organic agricultural practices are beneficial for wildlife health.",

Differences between males and females lead to a sexual segregation in habitat use. In southern Mexico, we explored sexspeciﬁc responses to landscape modiﬁcation of six common species of phyllostomid bats: Artibeus jamaicensis, A. lituratus, Sturnira lilium, Carollia perspicillata, Glossophaga soricina, and Platyrrhinus helleri using riparian corridors within continuous forest and cattle pastures. Furthermore, we explored sex related responses to vegetation attributes (i.e., tree height and basal area) and seasonality (i.e., wet and dry seasons). Overall, capture rates were signiﬁcantly skewed toward females and riparian corridors in pastures. Females of G. soricina exhibited a strong positive relationship with greater tree height and basal area. Seasonality was important for A. lituratus and S. lilium females, only. The results indicate a sexual driven response of bats to habitat modiﬁcation. The high energetic demands of females associated to reproduction could lead to foraging into riparian corridors in pastures. The presence of large trees along riparian corridors in pastures may help maintaining a diverse and dynamic bat community in modiﬁed tropical landscapes.",

The function of these calls in different species varies and could include eliciting help or acting as a warning signal to stay away. In this study, Cuban fruit-eating bats, Brachyphylla nana, were captured from La Barca Cave in Guanahacabibes National Park, Cuba and distress calls were recorded to examine call structure and variability among different bats. We used Avisoft SASlab pro to analyze 14 different spectral and temporal characteristics of the calls and utilized factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality in the data set and assess variability in call structure. The recorded calls and a pink noise control were used in a playback experiment inside the cave to analyze how bats respond to distress calls. An infrared video camera and ultrasonic microphone were used during the playback to determine if there were any changes in bat behavior, such as an increase in calls observed, bats ﬂying by the speaker, or bats leaving the area. Our results suggest that call structure is variable with limited evidence that call characteristics are unique to speciﬁc individuals. Our playbacks suggest that these calls serve a social function in that the number of bats approaching the speaker increased during distress call playbacks relative to the control. Future work will include building on these results to further explore Brachyphylla nana social behavior including anti-predatory behavior and social communication.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats (Mammalia: Chiroptera) have sophisticated acoustic abilities adapted to many uses, including both echolocation and social vocalisations. Social vocalisations are used in a wide variety of contexts and vary greatly in acoustic arrangement and complexity. Among the most intricate are the courtship songs that males of certain species use to attract mates and advertise their qualities. To date, however, few studies have examined the phonological construction of bat songs or made a detailed assessment of the syntax used to combine different song elements. Here, we examine the syntactic construction of courtship songs in the New Zealand lesser short-tailed bat,\n              Mystacina tuberculata\n              , a highly vocal, lek-breeding species with exceptionally high song-output rates. We hypothesised that song construction in this species is both hierarchical and non-random, and demonstrates a high degree of individual variation, potentially allowing for individual recognition. We recorded the courtship songs of nine male bats and used manual classification of song components to examine the song structure. Here we examine whether the deployment of different song components is dependent on their position, and also determine the transition probabilities between different components. We find that the frequency of song-element production and the distribution of elements within songs are non-random at both the individual and population level, and that the number of elements used per phrase differs between individuals. Overall, we demonstrate that\n              M. tuberculata\n              songs are hierarchically constructed and employ phonological syntax to build syllables and phrases. We further show that bats employ high structural similarity and conservatism in the construction of syllables, while retaining a capacity for versatility and innovation that allows for considerable individual variation and, likely, individual recognition.",
