Despite the importance of 3D spatial localization to parse objects in the environment and to guide movement, most neurophysiological investigations of sensory mapping have been limited to studies of restrained subjects, tested with 2D, artificial stimuli. Here, we show for the first time that sensory neurons in the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) of the free-flying echolocating bat encode 3D egocentric space, and that the bat’s inspection of objects in the physical environment sharpens tuning of single neurons, and shifts peak responses to represent closer distances. These findings emerged from wireless neural recordings in free-flying bats, in combination with an echo model that computes the animal’s instantaneous stimulus space.",

If data collected by citizen scientists were comparable to data collected by researchers, it would allow for more efﬁcient data collection over a broad geographic area. Here, we compare the quality of data on bat activity collected by citizens (high school students and teachers) and researchers. Both researchers and citizen scientists used the same comprehensive instructions when choosing study sites. We found no statistically signiﬁcant difference in total bat activity minutes recorded by citizens and researchers. Instead, citizen scientists collected data from a wider variety of habitats than researchers. Involvement of citizens also increased the geographical coverage of data collection, resulting in the northernmost documentation of the Nathusius’s pipistrelle so far in Finland. Therefore, bat research can beneﬁt from the use of citizen science when participants are given precise instructions and calibrated data collection equipment. Citizen science projects also have other far-reaching beneﬁts, increasing, for example, the scientiﬁc literacy and interest in natural sciences of citizens. Involving citizens in science projects also has the potential to enhance their willingness to conserve nature.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are important pest control agents in agriculture. Yet, the underlying fine-scale biotic and abiotic mechanisms that drive their foraging behaviors and responses to insect outbreaks are unclear. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) can attract both invertebrate and vertebrate natural enemies that use the chemical plant cues to locate insect prey. The ability of HIPVs to attract multiple species raises the question of whether they may also be a biotic factor influencing insectivorous bat activity. Additionally, abiotic factors, such as weather conditions, can affect bat activity in agricultural settings, but little is known about how bats respond to shifting environmental conditions on short timescales in this landscape context. Using a model crop system, soybean (Glycine max), our study asked three questions: (1) Which bat species are active in eastern Maryland soybean fields? (2) Is insectivorous bat activity affected by naturally occurring soybean HIPVs and/or synthetic soybean HIPVs (indole or farnesene)? (3) How is insectivorous bat activity affected by hourly weather conditions in this landscape? In soybean fields in eastern Maryland, we created paired treatment plots: HIPV plots (damaged plants or synthetic HIPV dispensers) and control plots (undamaged plants or empty dispensers). We measured bat activity using ultrasonic recorders, summarizing hourly and nightly activity, and detected 10 total species. The most abundant species were big brown/silver-haired bats (Eptesicus fuscus/Lasionycteris noctivagans). Bat activity did not significantly differ between control and HIPV plots in any of the three experiments. Thus, our results do not support our expectation that bats in eastern Maryland use soybean HIPVs to locate insect prey. However, bat activity did increase with increasing average hourly temperature and wind speed. This initial study of bats and HIPVs, as well as the fine-scale examination of weather conditions on bat activity, may serve as a guide for future research on bat–plant interactions that can support the development of new strategies for sustainable pest management.",

            "abstractNote": "Estimating animal populations is essential for conservation. Censusing large congregations is especially important since these are priorities for protection, but efficiently counting hundreds of thousands of moving animals remains a challenge. We developed a deep learning-based system using consumer cameras that not only counts but also records behavioral information for large numbers of flying animals in a range of lighting conditions including near darkness. We built a robust training set without human labeling by leveraging data augmentation and background subtraction. We demonstrate this approach by estimating the size of a straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) colony in Kasanka National Park, Zambia with cameras encircling the colony to record evening emergence. Detection of bats was robust to deteriorating lighting conditions and changing backgrounds. Combined over five days, our population estimates ranged between 750,000 and 976,000 bats with a mean of 857,233. In addition to counts, we extracted wingbeat frequency, flight altitude, and local group polarity for 639,414 individuals. This open access method is an inexpensive but powerful approach that, in addition to radial emergences from central locations, can also be applied to unidirectional movements of flying groups, such as migratory streams of birds.",

            "abstractNote": "River regulation can modify natural ﬂow regimes with deleterious effects on aquatic communities. While the effects of ﬂow manipulation on the physical environment and populations and assemblages of aquatic organisms have been described thoroughly, how and to what extent river regulation inﬂuences ecosystem processes like food web architecture is less studied. Emergent aquatic insect prey can provide an important food resource to riparian consumers like birds and bats with concomitant consequences for nutrient cycling through aquatic–terrestrial food webs, thus potentially increasing the spatial inﬂuence of river regulation into the riparian zone and beyond. We used naturally abundant stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to compare food web architecture (trophic position and reliance on an aquatic nutritional pathway) leading to birds and bats between a regulated river, the Tuolumne River downstream of Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, and an adjacent unregulated river, the Merced River, located in Yosemite National Park on the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. We found that both birds and bats derived >50% of their nutrition from food webs originating in photosynthesis by algae. In addition, birds and bats occupied a similar trophic position to predatory ﬁsh in other systems. Both birds and bats seemed to rely more strongly on an aquatic nutritional pathway during the dryer year of our study period, underscoring the potential importance of emergent aquatic prey as a water subsidy in dry systems and in dry years. In the Tuolumne River, reservoir managers strive to simulate characteristics of the natural ﬂow regime, including seasonal scouring ﬂows and prolonged ﬂoodplain inundation. Although we found no conclusive evidence of an effect of river regulation on food web responses, our study suggests that nutrient cycling through aquatic–terrestrial food webs expands the potential inﬂuence of river regulation to organisms and ecosystems typically characterized as terrestrial.",

            "abstractNote": "Host response to emerging pathogens is variable, causing uncertainty about population-level impacts and challenging effective disease management. White-nose syndrome (WNS) has caused catastrophic declines in some bat species, while others appear less impacted. Developing predictive models based on observed survival patterns can generate testable hypotheses about mechanisms driving population dynamics and contribute to the development of targeted approaches to disease management. We conducted a mark–recapture study of federally endangered Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) during 2011–2016. Annual survival decreased from 0.78 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.89) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.86) for females and males, respectively, in 2011 to 0.74 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.94) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.89) for females and males, respectively, in 2015. We then modeled two explanatory mechanisms potentially driving the observed patterns: (1) phased exposure to disease through the spatial spread of the pathogen within the hibernaculum; and (2) cumulative mortality risk from iterative yearly WNS infection. Under a phased exposure scenario, models suggest that infected individuals have an average survival probability of 0.68, and disease prevalence is predicted to reach 100% within 9 yr of disease emergence. Under the cumulative mortality risk hypothesis, survival probability of individuals decreases with each infection cycle. In either case, infected populations are predicted to stabilize at a negative growth rate. Results suggest that Indiana bats tolerate a pathogen load prior to onset of infection, leading to a less pronounced population decline than for other susceptible species. However, the long-term risk of WNS to Indiana bats may be more severe than current population trends suggest. To inform current conservation management, we performed a vital rate sensitivity analysis, which suggested that modest increases in survival (4–5%) through targeted intervention may return declining populations to stability (k = 1.0). Demographic modeling approaches coupled with continued population monitoring can highlight important differences in disease response, and ultimately extinction risk, in host species allowing conservation practitioners to tailor intervention actions so that they will be most effective.",

When these data were examined by means of linear regression and covariance analysis, we found that growth rates decreased linearly with increasing asymptotic body mass. When we removed the effect of body mass, growth rates showed no significant differences with respect to diet (insect or fruit), taxonomic affiliation (Megachiroptera or Microchiroptera), growth condition (captive or free-ranging), or basal metabolic rate. Climate (tropical or temperate) was the only variable that had a significant effect on post-natal growth rates, with temperate bats growing faster than tropical species. This climatic effect was also evident when insectivorous bats were examined separately. While post-natal growth rates may provide a valuable index of maternal investment, milk energy output of females during lactation should provide the most direct link between the environment and growth of pups. Milk composition and milk-energy output as indices of maternal investment have been investigated in only a few species of bats. From the limited dat available it appears that the milk of insectivorous species contains a higher percentage of dry matter, fat and protein than does that of frugivorous species.",

The telecoupling provides a conceptual framework for describing these interactions—for example, locations can be defined as sending areas (sources of flows of ecosystem services, energy, or information) or receiving areas (recipients of flows). However, the ability to quantify feedbacks between ecosystem change in one area and societal benefits in other areas requires analytical approaches. We use spatial subsidies—an approach developed to measure the degree to which a migratory species’ ability to provide services in one location depends on habitat in another location—as an example of how telecoupling can be operationalized. Using the cotton pest control and ecotourism services of Mexican free-tailed bats as an example, we determined that of the 16 states in the United States and Mexico where the species resides, three states (Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado) are receiving areas, while the rest of the states are sending areas. In addition, the magnitude of spatial subsidy can be used as an indicator of the degree to which different locations are telecoupled to other locations. In this example, the Mexican free-tailed bat ecosystem services to cotton production and ecotourism in Texas and New Mexico are heavily dependent on winter habitat in four states in central and southern Mexico. In sum, spatial subsidies can be used to operationalize the telecoupling conceptual framework by identifying sending and receiving areas, and by indicating the degree to which locations are telecoupled to other locations.",

Low-intensity agricultural practices, however, may not sacriﬁce yields if they support biodiversity-driven ecosystem services. We quantiﬁed the value native predators provide to farmers by consuming coffee’s most damaging insect pest, the coffee berry borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei). Our experiments in Costa Rica showed birds reduced infestation by ~ 50%, bats played a marginal role, and farmland forest cover increased pest removal. We identiﬁed borer-consuming bird species by assaying faeces for borer DNA and found higher borer-predator abundances on more forested plantations. Our coarse estimate is that forest patches doubled pest control over 230 km2 by providing habitat for ~ 55 000 borer-consuming birds. These pest-control services prevented US$75–US$310 ha-yearÀ1 in damage, a beneﬁt per plantation on par with the average annual income of a Costa Rican citizen. Retaining forest and accounting for pest control demonstrates a win–win for biodiversity and coffee farmers.",

            "abstractNote": "Wildlife conservation involves making management decisions with incomplete knowledge of ecological relationships. Efforts to augment foraging resources for the endangered Mexican long-n­ osed bat (Leptonycteris nivalis) are progressing despite limited knowledge about the species' foraging behavior and requirements. This study aimed to understand L. nivalis responses to floral resource availability, focusing on individual agave-­ and local-­scale characteristics influencing visitation rates to flowering agaves. We observed bat visitation at 62 flowering agaves around two roosts in northeast Mexico on 46 nights in the summers of 2017 and 2018. We found visitation rate had positive relationships with two agave-­scale characteristics: the number of umbels with open flowers and the lower vertical position on the stalk of those umbels (i.e., earlier phenological stages of flowering). However, these factors exhibited strong negative interaction: with few umbels with open flowers, the position of flowering umbels had little effect on visitation rate, but when umbels with open flowers were abundant, visitation rate was more strongly related to the lower flowering umbel position. We also found relationships between visitation rate and two local-­scale characteristics: negative for the density of flowering conspecifics within 30 m of the focal agave and positive for the density of dead standing agave stalks within 30 m. Our findings suggest opportunities to augment foraging resources for L. nivalis in ways that are consistent with their foraging behavior, including: increasing the supply of simultaneously blooming flowers by planting agave species that tend to have more umbels with simultaneously open flowers; planting multiple species of agaves with different flowering times to increase the availability of agaves with open flowers on lower-­positioned umbels throughout the period when bats are present in the region; planting agaves in clusters; and keeping dead standing agave stalks on the landscape. Our study points to useful management strategies that can be implemented and monitored as part of an adaptive management approach to aid in conservation efforts.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat population estimates are typically made during winter, although this is only feasible for bats that aggregate in hibernacula. While it is essential to measure summer bat population sizes for management, we lack a reliable method. Acoustic surveys should be less expensive and more efficient than capture surveys, and acoustic activity data are already used as indices of population size. Although we currently cannot differentiate individual bats by their calls, we can enter call counts, information on signal and detection angles, and weather data into generalized random encounter models to estimate bat density. We assessed the utility of generalized random encounter models for estimating Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) population density with acoustic data collected at 51 total sites in six conservation areas in northeast Missouri, 2019–2021. We tested the effects of year, volancy period, conservation area, and their interactions on estimated density. Volancy period was the best predictor, with average predicted density increasing 60% from pre-­volancy (46 bats/km2) to post-­volancy (74 bats/km2); however, the magnitude of the effect differed by conservation area. We showed that passive acoustic surveys yield informative density estimates that are responsive to temporal changes in bat population size, which suggests this method may be useful for long-­term monitoring. However, we need more information to choose the most appropriate values for the density estimation formula. Future work to refine this approach should include assessments of bat behavior and detection parameters and testing the method's efficacy in areas where population sizes are known.",

            "abstractNote": "For many species, estimating density is challenging, but it is important for conservation planning and understanding the functional role of species. Bats play key ecological roles, yet little is known about their free-­ranging density. We used a long-­term banding study of four species caught in an extensively forested climate refuge and spatial capture–­recapture models (SCR) to estimate density and its change over time. Between 1999 and 2020, there were 3671 captures of four bat species, which were all edge-­space foragers. Recaptures represented 16% (n = 587) of all captures, of which 89 were between-­trap-­cluster movements. Closed spatial mark–­recapture models estimated plausible densities that varied with elevation. Preferred elevations differed between species, with density averaging 0.63 ha−1 for Vespadelus darlingtoni (high elevation), 0.43 ha−1 for V. pumilus (low elevation), 0.19 ha−1 for Chalinolobus morio (high elevation), and 0.08 ha−1 for V. regulus (high elevation). Overall, densities were higher than most previous published estimates for bats. Forest disturbance history (past timber harvesting) had no detectable effect on density. Density also varied substantially across years, and although annual maximum temperature and rainfall were not supported in models, some time periods showed an apparent relationship between density and annual rainfall (+ve) and/or annual maximum temperature (−ve). The most notable change was an increase in the density of V. pumilus after 2013, which tracked an increase in annual temperature at the site, reflecting a warming climate. Bat densities in forests outside of climate refugia are likely to be more sensitive to climate change, but more studies are needed in different habitats and continents and outside climate refugia to place the densities we estimated into a broader context.",

            "abstractNote": "Prior to the introduction of white-­nose syndrome (WNS) to North America, temperate bats were thought to remain within hibernacula throughout most of the winter. However, recent research has shown that bats in the southeastern United States emerge regularly from hibernation and are active on the landscape, regardless of their WNS status. The relationship between winter activity and susceptibility to WNS has yet to be explored but warrants attention, as it may enable managers to implement targeted management for WNS-­affected species. We investigated this relationship by implanting 1346 passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags in four species that vary in their susceptibility to WNS. Based on PIT-­tag detections, three species entered hibernation from late October to early November. Bats were active at hibernacula entrances on days when midpoint temperatures ranged from −1.94 to 22.78°C (mean midpoint temperature = 8.70 ± 0.33°C). Eastern small-­footed bats (Myotis leibii), a species with low susceptibility to WNS, were active throughout winter, with a significant decrease in activity in mid-­hibernation (December 16 to February 15). Tricolored bats (Perimyotis subflavus), a species that is highly susceptible to WNS, exhibited an increase in activity beginning in mid-­hibernation and extending through late hibernation (February 16 to March 31). Indiana bats (M. sodalis), a species determined to have a medium–­high susceptibility to WNS, remained on the landscape into early hibernation (November 1 to December 15), after which we did not record any again until the latter portion of mid-­hibernation. Finally, gray bats (M. grisescens), another species with low susceptibility to WNS, maintained low but regular levels of activity throughout winter. Given these results, we determined that emergence activity from hibernacula during winter is highly variable among bat species and our data will assist wildlife managers to make informed decisions regarding the timing of implementation of species-­specific conservation actions.",

            "abstractNote": "White-­nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans which has resulted in the deaths of millions of bats across eastern North America. To date, hibernacula counts have been the predominant means of tracking the spread and impact of this disease on bat populations. However, an understanding of the impacts of WNS on demographic parameters outside the winter season is critical to conservation and recovery of bat populations impacted by this disease. We used long-­term monitoring data to examine WNS-­related impacts to summer populations in West Virginia, where WNS has been documented since 2009. Using capture data from 290 mist-n­ et sites surveyed from 2003 to 2019 on the Monongahela National Forest, we estimated temporal patterns in presence and relative abundance for each bat species. For species that exhibited a population-l­evel response to WNS, we investigated post-­WNS changes in adult female reproductive state and body mass. Myotis lucifugus (little brown bat), M. septentrionalis (northern long-­eared bat), and Perimyotis subflavus (tri-­colored bat) all showed significant decreases in presence and relative abundance during and following the introduction of WNS, while Eptesicus fuscus (big brown bat) and Lasiurus borealis (eastern red bat) responded positively during the WNS invasion. Probability of being reproductively active was not significantly different for any species, though a shift to earlier reproduction was estimated for E. fuscus and M. septentrionalis. For some species, body mass appeared to be influenced by the WNS invasion, but the response differed by species and reproductive state. Results suggest that continued long-­term monitoring studies, additional research into impacts of this disease on the fitness of WNS survivors, and a focus on providing optimal nonwintering habitat may be valuable strategies for assessing and promoting recovery of WNS-­affected bat populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Insectivorous bats are efficient predators of pest arthropods in agroecosystems. This pest control service has been estimated to be worth billions of dollars to agriculture globally. However, few studies have explicitly investigated the composition and abundance of dietary prey items consumed or assessed the ratio of pest and beneficial arthropods, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the pest control service provided. In this study, we used metabarcoding to identify the prey items eaten by insectivorous bats over the cotton-growing season in an intensive cropping region in northern New South Wales, Australia. We found that seven species of insectivorous bat (n = 58) consumed 728 prey species, 13 of which represented around 50% of total prey abundance consumed. Importantly, the identified prey items included major arthropod pests, comprising 65% of prey relative abundance and 13% of prey species recorded. Significant cotton pests such as Helicoverpa punctigera (Australian bollworm) and Achyra affinitalis (cotton webspinner) were detected in at least 76% of bat fecal samples, with Teleogryllus oceanicus (field crickets), Helicoverpa armigera (cotton bollworm), and Crocidosema plebejana (cotton tipworm) detected in 55% of bat fecal samples. Our results indicate that insectivorous bats are selective predators that exploit a narrow selection of preferred pest taxa and potentially play an important role in controlling lepidopteran pests on cotton farms. Our study provides crucial information for farmers to determine the service or disservice provided by insectivorous bats in relation to crops, for on-farm decision making.",

The majority of research in this area has focussed on observational data from bat rehabilitators documenting injuries, and cat owners, when domestic cats present prey. However, this has the potential to underestimate the number of bats killed or injured by cats. Here, we use forensic DNA analysis techniques to analyze swabs taken from injured bats in the United Kingdom, mainly including Pipistrellus pipistrellus (40 out of 72 specimens). Using quantitative PCR, cat DNA was found in two-thirds of samples submitted by bat rehabilitators. Of these samples, short tandem repeat analysis produced partial DNA profiles for approximately one-third of samples, which could be used to link predation events to individual cats. The use of genetic analysis can complement observational data and potentially provide additional information to give a more accurate estimation of cat predation.",

Here, we focus on one particularly extreme example of sexual dimorphism. Many mammal species possess a bone in their penis called a baculum. The female equivalent of this bone is called the baubellum and occurs in the clitoris, which is developmentally homologous to the male penis. To understand the potential linkage between these two structures, we scored baculum/baubellum presence/absence across 163 species and analyzed their distribution in a phylogenetic framework. The majority of species (N = 134) shared the same state in males and females (both baculum and baubellum present or absent). However, the baubellum has experienced significantly more transitions, and more recent transitions, so that the remaining 29 species have a baculum but not a well-­developed baubellum. Even in species where both bones are present, the baubellum shows more ontogenetic variability and harbors more morphological variation than the baculum. Our study demonstrates that the baculum and baubellum are generally correlated across mammals, but that the baubellum is more evolutionarily and developmentally labile than the baculum. The accumulation of more evolutionary transitions, especially losses in the baubellum, as well as noisier developmental patterns, suggests that the baubellum may be nonfunctional, and lost over time.",

Across North Carolina, USA, we used the standardized North American Bat Monitoring Program mobile transect protocol to survey bat activity in 2015 and 2016 at 41 sites. We collected statewide water quality and urban land cover data to disentangle the effects of urbanization and water quality degradation on bats at the landscape scale. We found that statewide, water quality degradation and urbanization were not correlated. We found that bats responded to water quality degradation and urbanization independently at the landscape scale. Eptesicus fuscus and Lasiurus cinereus negatively responded to water quality degradation. Lasiurus borealis and Perimyotis subflavus positively responded to water quality degradation. Lasionycteris noctivagans did not respond to water quality degradation but was more active in more urbanized areas. Tadarida brasiliensis positively responded to urbanization and was less active in areas with degraded water quality. We show that bat–water quality relationships found at the local scale are evident at a landscape scale. We confirm that bats are useful bioindicators for both urbanization and water quality degradation. We suggest that water quality can be used to predict the presence of bat species of conservation concern, such as P. subflavus, in areas where it has not been studied locally.",

However, relatively little is known about the origin of thermoregulatory regimes in a phylogenetic context, or the genetic mechanisms driving the evolution of these regimes. Using bats as a study system, we examined the evolution of three thermoregulatory regimes (hibernation, daily heterothermy, and homeothermy) in relation to the evolution of leptin, a protein implicated in regulation of torpor bouts in mammals, including bats. A threshold model was used to test for a correlation between lineages with positively selected lep, the gene encoding leptin, and the thermoregulatory regimes of those lineages. Although evidence for episodic positive selection of lep was found, positive selection was not correlated with lineages of heterothermic bats, a finding that contradicts results from previous studies. Evidence from our ancestral state reconstructions suggests that the most recent common ancestor of bats used daily heterothermy and that the presence of hibernation is highly unlikely at this node. Hibernation likely evolved independently at least four times in bats—once in the common ancestor of Vespertilionidae and Molossidae, once in the clade containing Rhinolophidae and Rhinopomatidae, and again independently in the lineages leading to Taphozous melanopogon and Mystacina tuberculata. Our reconstructions revealed that thermoregulatory regimes never transitioned directly from hibernation to homeothermy, or the reverse, in the evolutionary history of bats. This, in addition to recent evidence that heterothermy is best described along a continuum, suggests that thermoregulatory regimes in mammals are best represented as an ordered continuous trait (homeothermy ← → daily torpor ← → hibernation) rather than as the three discrete regimes that evolve in an unordered fashion. These results have important implications for methodological approaches in future physiological and evolutionary research.",

            "abstractNote": "Acoustic surveys of bats are one of the techniques most commonly used by ecological practitioners. The results are used in Ecological Impact Assessments to assess the likely impacts of future developments on species that are widely protected in law, and to monitor developments’ postconstruction. However, there is no standardized methodology for analyzing or interpreting these data, which can make the assessment of the ecological value of a site very subjective. Comparisons of sites and projects are therefore difficult for ecologists and decision-­makers, for example, when trying to identify the best location for a new road based on relative bat activity levels along alternative routes. Here, we present a new web-­based, data-­driven tool, Ecobat, which addresses the need for a more robust way of interpreting ecological data. Ecobat offers users an easy, standardized, and objective method for analyzing bat activity data. It allows ecological practitioners to compare bat activity data at regional and national scales and to generate a numerical indicator of the relative importance of a night’s worth of bat activity. The tool is free and open-­source; because the underlying algorithms are already developed, it could easily be expanded to new geographical regions and species. Data donation is required to ensure the robustness of the analyses; we use a positive feedback mechanism to encourage ecological practitioners to share data by providing in return high quality, contextualized data analysis, and graphical visualizations for direct use in ecological reports.",

            "abstractNote": "Temperate zone bats may be more sensitive to climate change than other groups of mammals because many aspects of their ecology are closely linked to temperature. However, few studies have tried to predict the responses of bats to climate change. The Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) is a federally listed endangered species that is found in the eastern United States. The northerly distribution of Indiana bat summer maternity colonies relative to their winter distributions suggests that warmer climates may result in a shift in their summer distribution. Our objectives were to determine the climatic factors associated with Indiana bat maternity range and forecast changes in the amount and distribution of the range under future climates. We used Maxent to model the suitable climatic habitat of Indiana bats under current conditions and four future climate forecasts for 2021–30, 2031–40, 2041–50, and 2051–60. Average maximum temperature across the maternity season (May–August) was the most important variable in the model of current distribution of Indiana bat maternity colonies with suitability decreasing considerably above 28ºC. The areal extent of the summer maternity distribution of Indiana bats was forecasted to decline and be concentrated in the northeastern United States and Appalachian Mountains; the western part of the current maternity range (Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio) was forecasted to become climatically unsuitable under most future climates. Our models suggest that high temperatures may be a factor in roost-site selection at the regional scale and in the future, may also be an important variable at the microhabitat scale. When behavioral changes fail to mitigate the effects of high temperature, range shifts are likely to occur. Thus, habitat management for Indiana bat maternity colonies in the northeastern United States and Appalachian Mountains of the Southeast is critical as these areas will most likely serve as climatic refugia.",

Cities comprise a complex assortment of habitat types yet we know relatively little about the effects of their composition and spatial conﬁguration on species distribution. Although many bat species exploit human resources, the majority of species are negatively impacted by urbanization. Here, we use data from the National Bat Monitoring Programme, a long-running citizen science scheme, to assess how two cryptic European bat species respond to the urban landscape. A total of 124 9 1 km2 sites throughout Britain were surveyed. The landscape surrounding each site was mapped and classiﬁed into discrete biotope types (e.g., woodland). Generalized linear models were used to assess differences in the response to the urban environment between the two species, and which landscape factors were associated with the distributions of P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus. The relative prevalence of P. pygmaeus compared to P. pipistrellus was greater in urban landscapes with a higher density of rivers and lakes, whereas P. pipistrellus was frequently detected in landscapes comprising a high proportion of green space (e.g., parklands). Although P. pipistrellus is thought to be well adapted to the urban landscape, we found a strong negative response to urbanization at a relatively local scale (1 km), whilst P. pygmaeus was detected more regularly in wooded urban landscapes containing freshwater. These results show differential habitat use at a landscape scale of two morphologically similar species, indicating that cryptic species may respond differently to anthropogenic disturbance. Even species considered relatively common and well adapted to the urban landscape may respond negatively to the built environment highlighting the future challenges involved in maintaining biodiversity within an increasingly urbanized world.",

Small mammals can achieve large energetic savings when torpid, but they are also subject to ecological costs. Studying torpor use in an ecological and physiological context can help elucidate relative costs and beneﬁts of torpor to different groups within a population. We measured skin temperatures of 46 adult Raﬁnesque’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus raﬁnesquii) to evaluate thermoregulatory strategies of a heterothermic small mammal during the reproductive season. We compared daily average and minimum skin temperatures as well as the frequency, duration, and depth of torpor bouts of sex and reproductive classes of bats inhabiting day-roosts with different thermal characteristics. We evaluated roosts with microclimates colder (caves) and warmer (buildings) than ambient air temperatures, as well as roosts with intermediate conditions (trees and rock crevices). Using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC), we found that different statistical models best predicted various characteristics of torpor bouts. While the type of day-roost best predicted the average number of torpor bouts that bats used each day, current weather variables best predicted daily average and minimum skin temperatures of bats, and reproductive condition best predicted average torpor bout depth and the average amount of time spent torpid each day by bats. Finding that different models best explain varying aspects of heterothermy illustrates the importance of torpor to both reproductive and nonreproductive small mammals and emphasizes the multifaceted nature of heterothermy and the need to collect data on numerous heterothermic response variables within an ecophysiological context.",

If particular functional traits characterize the favored plant species, then defaunation may alter community-wide patterns of functional trait composition. Changes in plant functional traits occurring with defaunation may help identify the species interactions affected by defaunation and the potential for other cascading effects of defaunation. We tested the hypotheses that defaunation would (1) disrupt seed dispersal, thereby favoring species whose dispersal agents are not affected (e.g., small birds, bats, and abiotic agents), (2) reduce seed predation, thereby favoring larger-seeded species, and (3) reduce herbivory, thereby favoring species with lower leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf toughness, and wood density. We examined how these six traits responded to vertebrate defaunation caused by hunters or by experimental exclosures among more than 30 000 woody seedlings in a lowland tropical moist forest. Exclosures reduced terrestrial frugivores, granivores, and herbivores, while hunters also reduced volant and arboreal frugivores and granivores. The comparison of exclosures and hunting allowed us to parse the impacts of arboreal and volant species (reduced by hunters only) and terrestrial species (reduced by both hunters and exclosures). The loss of terrestrial vertebrates alone had limited effects on plant trait composition. The additional loss of volant and arboreal vertebrates caused signiﬁcant shifts in plant species composition towards communities with more species dispersed abiotically, including lianas and low wood-density tree species, and fewer species dispersed by large vertebrates. In contrast to previous studies, community seed mass did not decline signiﬁcantly in hunted sites. Our exclosure results suggest this is because reducing seed predators disproportionately beneﬁts large-seeded species, partially compensating for the reduction of seed dispersers at hunted sites. Our results demonstrate that decreased seed dispersal and seed predation are important determinants of seedling community compositional change as a consequence of defaunation. Defaunation may also negatively impact carbon storage in tropical forests, by favoring lianas and low wood density tree species.",

Predators and their prey form complex interaction networks, in which predators consume not only herbivores but also other predators. Resolving these interactions will be essential for predicting changes in many important ecosystem functions, such as the control of damaging crop pests. Here, we examine how birds, bats, and arthropods interact to determine herbivorous arthropod abundance and leaf damage in Costa Rican coffee plantations. In an exclosure experiment, we found that birds and bats reduced nonﬂying arthropod abundance by ;35% and ;25%, respectively. In contrast, birds and bats increased the abundance of ﬂying arthropods, probably by consuming spiders. The frequency of this intraguild predation differed between birds and bats, with cascading consequences for coffee shrubs. Excluding birds caused a greater increase in herbivorous arthropod abundance than excluding bats, leading to increased coffee leaf damage. Excluding bats caused an increase in spiders and other predatory arthropods, increasing the ratio of predators to herbivores in the arthropod community. Bats, therefore, did not provide beneﬁts to coffee plants. Leaf damage on coffee was low, and probably did not affect coffee yields. Birdmediated control of herbivores, however, may aid coffee shrubs in the long term by preventing pest outbreaks. Regardless, our results demonstrate how complex, cascading interactions between predators and herbivores may impact plants and people.",

Domination refers to taxonomic diversity and the fraction of the taxon that is classified in the most diverse subtaxon. We attempt to explain how subtaxa come to dominate their phyletic counterparts by examining correlations between taxonomic diversity and life history traits such as age of first reproduction, longevity, fecundity and partitioning of reproduction, and resource availability in a variety of vertebrate, invertebrate, and plant groups. Regardless of taxonomic group or rank, the number of taxa within an assemblage, or the school of taxonomy employed, diverse taxa were characterized by short generation time (early age of first reproduction and short life-span) and the ability to contact many resources (high mobility and high resource availability). We suggest that the intrinsic character of short generation time increases diversity because it promotes speciation and reduces extinction. Extrinsic factors such as resource availability and environmental complexity and variability may have a secondary influence on diversity by constraining or enhancing speciation for taxa with short generation times.",

            "abstractNote": "Background  The timing of behavior and habitat use of nocturnal animals can be influenced by the lunar cycle in nature. The prevalence of artificial light at night (ALAN) has been recognized as a source of environmental pol‑lution. The interaction between ALAN and the lunar cycle on bat behavior is important for understanding anthro‑pogenic effects on bats. We utilized a decade (2012–2022) of acoustic monitoring data collected in North Carolina, United States, to investigate the relationship between bat activity, lunar cycle, and light pollution. We examined whether the amount of lunar illumination affected species-specific nightly activity and whether hourly bat activity patterns varied between nights with different moon phases. We further investigated if the relationship between bat activity and the lunar cycle might be altered by light pollution.\nResults  We found that seven bat species showed activity variation across nights in relation to the amount of moon illumination when ALAN was absent. In general, bats were less active on full moon nights compared to new moon nights. Light pollution interacted with the bat–lunar relationship in five of the seven species, masking the effect of the lunar cycle. We identified delayed bat activity patterns on nights with a full or waxing moon in seven species, and light pollution altered that pattern in four species. Overall, ALAN was associated with decreased bat activity inde‑pendent of lunar cycle effects.\nConclusions  Our study demonstrated that at a broad spatial scale, ALAN negatively affected many North American temperate bat species and altered their lunar chronobiology. As light pollution is spreading to historically dark areas and habitats, ALAN might couple with other threats, such as the white-nose syndrome or climate change, to cause cascading damage in the environment that depends on ecosystem services such as pest control provided by bats. We argue that further research and conservation actions are needed to mitigate the impact of light pollution.",

Adult bugs were found to be reduced much more severely than adult beetles in moving from secondary vegetation to primaryforest understory.The number of species and individualsof insects is severely reduced in this transition, though the reduction in number of species is probably an artifact of inadequate samples from the forest understory. There is a strong movement of insects into moist refugia during the dry season, and a strong reduction in numbers of species and individuals during the dry season in areas with a severe dry season. In areas with a very mild dry season, the numbers and species of insects appear to rise during the dry season. There is very low overlap in insect species composition between secondary vegetation and the adjacent forest understory. The numbers of insects and species above intermediate elevations show a general decrease, and intermediateelevations appear to have the highest insect density. This is believed due to a higher harvestable productivity from the plant community at intermediate elevations owing to lowered plant maintenance costs on cool nights. The insect community changes little from day to night, except during the dry season in areas that have a severe dry season. Here there is a dramatic increase in individuals and numbers of species at night, in dry sites with nearby moist refugia. It appears that a high proportion of the insect communitypasses the dry season as active adults in reproductivediapause.",

            "abstractNote": "Logging is one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity, while forests are one of the most important habitats for bats. Bats that roost in tree cavities require a large number of potential roosts due to their frequent roost switching. However, the density of tree cavities and hollows sufficient to sustain large populations of bat species in forests is unknown. The fission-fusion dynamics of bat groups in forest environment is associated with rit­ ualised dawn swarming behaviour at potential tree cavities that serves to exchange information in a noncentralised decision-making process. We used a computer model based on the swarm algorithm, SkyBat, that resembles this complex process and aimed to determine how population size changes over time when cavity trees are removed from roosting territory of the local population of Leisler's bats (Nyctalus leisleri), which inhabit a forest habitat in Central Europe. Simulations revealed that social bonds between bats, maintained by frequent switching among groups, play an important role in this highly dynamic system. When strong social contact was not considered, reducing the original number of trees with cavities (20 cavities × ha− 1) to 50% was still acceptable to bats, but further interventions and/or increased demand for social contact would have led to local extinction of the species. Results suggest that potential bat roosts in mature forest stands should be preserved as much as possible and that non-intensive logging and management can be beneficial to tree-dwelling bats.",

Understanding animal behavior in the wild or other unconstrained environments is often based on animal movements. The technology described here is for understanding how bird and bat behavior is affected by the presence of wind turbines, specifically offshore wind turbines which are challenging to monitor. There is a need for both baseline data prior to wind farm construction and post-construction data when the turbines are operating. Thermal cameras were chosen because they are equally effective both night and day. In previous work, we developed a method for generating two-dimensional images of animal motion using thermal video from a single camera. The motion track image is formed by combining a sequence of video frames into a single composite image that shows the entire flight trajectory. Here we demonstrate that the composite motion track images from a stereo pair of thermal cameras can be used directly to generate three-dimensional tracks in real time without the need for an explicit tracking algorithm. The method was evaluated using an unmanned aerial system (UAS) equipped with GPS. The UAS flew both straight and curving trajectories at distances between 50 and 325 m from the camera system. The ThermalTracker-3D estimated positions were within ±10 m of the GPS-derived positions in the x and y (flight height) dimensions, and within ±20 m in the z (range) dimension for 90% of the data points.The range estimates were within the bounds of the achievable accuracy of the cameras and camera arrangement used. The results demonstrate the practical usefulness of the method for assessing collision risk to seabirds at proposed offshore wind energy sites and for quantifying avoidance behavior at operating offshore wind farms.",

An emerging field, computational ethology, is challenging this approach by using machine learning to automate the process. However, the use of such methods in general is complicated by a lack of modularity, leading to high cost and long development times. At the same time, the benefits of implementing a fully automated pipeline are often minuscule. We propose online analysis as a way to gain more from automating the process, such as making it easier to ensure that equipment is properly configured and calibrated, enabling the recording equipment to follow the animals, and even enabling closed-loop experiments. In this work, we discuss the requirements and challenges for such a system and propose an implementation based on modern IT infra­ structure. Finally, we demonstrate the system in case studies of bats and mongoose. As more and more methods and algorithms are developed we expect online systems to enable new experimental setups to study behaviour, leading to new insights in the field.",

            "abstractNote": "Owing to major technological advances, bioacoustics has become a burgeoning ﬁeld in ecological research worldwide. Autonomous passive acoustic recorders are becoming widely used to monitor aerial insectivorous bats, and automatic classiﬁers have emerged to aid researchers in the daunting task of analysing the resulting massive acoustic datasets. However, the scarcity of comprehensive reference call libraries still hampers their wider application in highly diverse tropical assemblages. Capitalizing on a unique acoustic dataset of > 650,000 bat call sequences collected over a 3-year period in the Brazilian Amazon, the aims of this study were (a) to assess how pre-identiﬁed recordings of free-ﬂying and hand-released bats could be used to train an automatic classiﬁcation algorithm (random forest), and (b) to optimize acoustic analysis protocols by combining automatic classiﬁcation with visual post-validation, whereby we evaluated the proportion of sound ﬁles to be post-validated for diﬀerent thresholds of classiﬁcation accuracy. Classiﬁers were trained at species or sonotype (group of species with similar calls) level. Random forest models conﬁrmed the reliability of using calls of both free-ﬂying and hand-released bats to train custom-built automatic classiﬁers. To achieve a general classiﬁcation accuracy of ~85%, random forest had to be trained with at least 500 pulses per species/sonotype. For seven out of 20 sonotypes, the most abundant in our dataset, we obtained high classiﬁcation accuracy (> 90%). Adopting a desired accuracy probability threshold of 95% for the random forest classiﬁer, we found that the percentage of sound ﬁles required for manual post-validation could be reduced by up to 75%, a signiﬁcant saving in terms of workload. Combining automatic classiﬁcation with manual ID through fully customizable classiﬁers implemented in open-source software as demonstrated here shows great potential to help overcome the acknowledged risks and biases associated with the sole reliance on automatic classiﬁcation.",

Automated processing makes continuous monitoring over extended periods of time feasible, and maximizes the information provided by video. This is especially important for collecting data in remote locations that are difﬁcult for human observers to access, such as proposed offshore wind turbine sites. We developed new processing algorithms for single camera thermal video that automate the extraction of two-dimensional bird and bat ﬂight tracks, and that characterize the extracted tracks to support animal identiﬁcation and behavior inference. The algorithms consist of video peak store followed by background masking and perceptual grouping to extract ﬂight tracks. The extracted tracks are automatically quantiﬁed in terms that could then be used to infer animal taxonomy and possibly behavior, as described in the companion article from Cullinan, et al. [“Classiﬁcation of birds and bats using ﬂight tracks.” Ecological Informatics, 27:55–63]. The developed automated processing was evaluated using six video clips containing a total of 184 ﬂight tracks. The detection rate was 81% and the false positive rate was 17%. In addition to describing the details of the algorithms, we suggest models for interpreting thermal imaging information.",

            "abstractNote": "Loss of crop yield due to non-native invasive pests is a global phenomenon with profound population, biodi­ versity, ecosystem, and economic impacts. The polyphagous and migratory fall armyworm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae) has become a major invasive pest around the globe in the past decade, posing a great threat to global food security. Early warning and timely detection of this pest and its associated agri­ cultural risks are essential for preventing, intervening, controlling, and mitigating invasion threats, which could reduce crop losses and economic damage. However, one key challenge is how to effectively and accurately monitor pest invasion as soon as possible prior to their establishment. Here, we aimed to determine the effec­ tiveness of four different methods for identifying the presence of FAW, namely DNA metabarcoding, field survey, light trap, and sex pheromone trap. We collected fecal samples of six bat species in the FAW colonization area, including Rhinolophus pearsonii, Rhinolophus rex, Ia io, Myotis altarium, Myotis pilosus, and Myotis chinensis. We then utilized bat fecal samples to monitor FAW through DNA metabarcoding during its early establishment stages and compared this approach to three traditional surveillance methods. The results revealed interspecific dif­ ferences in the occurrence frequency of FAW in different bat species. Furthermore, bat fecal DNA metabarcoding successfully monitored the occurrence of this pest nearly one month in advance compared with traditional ap­ proaches, which coincides with the adult migration time of larval counterparts found in the field based on effective accumulated temperature calculations. Our results showed that DNA metabarcoding dietary analysis of generalist insectivorous bats can be an effective, noninvasive, and economically viable tool for invasion pests monitoring to inform management decisions.",

            "abstractNote": "To encourage forest managers to use biodiversity indicators in their work, providing environmental variables that depict species habitats, have well-calibrated and strong relationships with biodiversity and are easy to routinely record would be a step forward. The Index of Biodiversity Potential (IBP) is a rapid habitat assessment method widely used in France. It uses ten variables that indicate potential habitat for forest-dwelling species and is easy for forest managers to implement during their day-to-day activities. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the indicator power of these IBP variables at the stand scale, i.e. their capacity to co-vary with empirical species richness and composition data for nine taxa. The data were obtained from 487 plots set up in 19 forested areas in France. Taxonomic data focused on corticolous lichens, corticolous and saproxylic bryophytes, polypores, saproxylic beetles, ground beetles, hoverﬂies, birds, bats and vascular plants. For the latter ﬁve taxa, we built subgroups of forest-specialist species. The IBP variables were recorded on 1-ha circular plots centered on the sampling point used to record taxonomic data. We explored the relationships between the IBP variables and species composition/richness of nine taxa at the stand scale. Furthermore, we searched for threshold values for all the signiﬁcant relationships found between species richness and the IBP variables. Variations in the species composition of vascular plants and saproxylic beetles, and to a lesser extent, polypores, bats and lichens, were signiﬁcantly related to habitat variations (ranked according to the Procrustes signiﬁcance level). The contribution of the IBP variables to the total inertia of species composition was about 18.7% on average. The IBP variables had a lower number of signiﬁcant relationships with species richness than with species composition. Unexpectedly, the forest subgroups mainly showed fewer signiﬁcant relationships with habitat variables than did the full-groups, both for species richness and composition. We highlighted seven signiﬁcant thresholds in the habitat variables above which species richness was signiﬁcantly higher. Finally, we recommend that forest managers (i) routinely use a rapid habitat assessment such as the IBP, (ii) orient silvicultural practices to ensure conservation of autochtonous tree species, large logs and diﬀerent types of aquatic habitats above the thresholds highlighted in this study, and (iii) periodically complete a biodiversity assessment at the forest scale by recording taxonomic data.",

Our study aims to identify potential sets of indicator taxa to be recommended in temperate forests. We focused on nine forest taxa: vascular plants, bryophytes, saproxylic beetles, polypores, lichens, ground beetles, hoverﬂies, birds and bats. We assessed crosstaxon congruence patterns, in terms of both alpha and beta-diversity, using empirical biodiversity data from 206 plots in ten French forested areas. We evaluated the cost-eﬃciency of potential surrogate taxa using both strictly encoded expert knowledge and results of this study. The most congruent taxa in alpha-diversity were bryophytes (with bats and polypores), and ground beetles (with bats and saproxylic beetles), though levels of covariation were mostly weak. The most congruent taxon in beta-diversity was vascular plants (with bryophytes, ground beetles, lichens and forest birds). Contrary to our expectations, the subsets of forest species within a given taxon exhibited a lower surrogacy than the taxon as a whole. Four categories of taxa were delineated based on costeﬃciency scores – from costless but ineﬀective (bats and ground beetles) to costly but eﬀective (saproxylic beetles and polypores). No single taxon was ﬁrmly identiﬁed as a relevant surrogate for other taxa; using a set of two or three taxa drastically increased surrogacy, compared with single-taxon approaches. Saproxylic beetles associated with vascular plants, or with both vascular plants and birds, seemed to be the most cost-eﬃcient associations. Further research is required to up-scale our results from the short-term, local scale to the long-term, landscape scale in European temperate forests.",

            "abstractNote": "In multifunctional landscapes, diverse communities of flying vertebrate predators provide vital services of insect pest control. In such landscapes, conservation biocontrol should benefit service-providing species to enhance the flow, stability and resilience of pest control services supporting the production of food and fiber. However, this would require identifying key service providers, which may be challenging when multiple predators interact with multiple pests. Here we provide a framework to identify the functional role of individual species to pest control in multifunctional landscapes. First, we used DNA metabarcoding to provide detailed data on pest species predation by diverse predator communities. Then, these data were fed into an extensive network analysis, in which information relevant for conservation biocontrol is gained from parameters describing network structure (e.g., modularity) and species roles in such network (e.g., centrality, specialization). We applied our framework to a Mediterranean landscape, where 19 bat species were found to feed on 132 insect pest species. Metabarcoding data revealed potentially important bats that consumed insect pest species in high frequency and/or diversity. Network analysis showed a modular structure, indicating sets of bat species that are required to regulate specific sets of insect pests. A few generalist bats had particularly important roles, either at network or module levels. Extinction simulations highlighted six bats, including species of conservation concern, which were sufficient to ensure that over three-quarters of the pest species had at least one bat predator. Combining DNA metabarcoding and ecological network analysis provides a valuable framework to identify individual species within diverse predator communities that might have a disproportionate contribution to pest control services in multifunctional landscapes. These species can be regarded as candidate targets for conservation biocontrol, although additional information is needed to evaluate their actual effectiveness in pest regulation.",

We provide the ﬁrst estimates of synchronicity, magnitude, and timing of seasonal birthing in Mops condylurus, a putative ebolavirus host, and a co-roosting species, Mops pumilus (formerly Chaerephon pumilus). We show that population-level synchronicity of M. condylurus birthing is wide (* 8.5 weeks) and even wider in M. pumilus (> 11 weeks). This is predicted to promote the likelihood of ﬁlovirus persistence under conditions of bi-annual birthing (two births per year). Ecological features underlying the magnitude of the birth pulse—relative female abundance (higher than expected for M. condylurus and lower for M. pumilus, based on literature) and reproductive rate (lower than expected)—will have countering effects on birthing magnitude. Species-speciﬁc models are needed to interpret how identiﬁed birth pulse attributes may interact with other features of molossid ebolavirus ecology to inﬂuence infection dynamics. As a common feature of wildlife species, and a key driver of infection dynamics, detailed information on seasonal birthing will be fundamental for future research on these species and will be informative for bat-borne zoonoses generally.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are important hosts of zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential, including ﬁloviruses, MERSCoronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV -1, and likely SARS-CoV-2. Viral infection and transmission among wildlife are dependent on a combination of factors that include host ecology and immunology, life history traits, roosting habitats, biogeography, and external stressors. Between 2016 and 2018, four species of insectivorous bats from a readily accessed roadside cave and buildings in Ethiopia were sampled and tested for viruses using consensus PCR assays for ﬁve viral families/genera. Previously identiﬁed and novel coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses were identiﬁed in 99 of the 589 sampled bats. Bats sampled from the cave site were more likely to test positive for a CoV than bats sampled from buildings; viral shedding was more common in the wet season; and rectal swabs were the most common sample type to test positive. A previously undescribed alphacoronavirus was detected in two bat species from different taxonomic families, sampling interfaces, geographic locations, and years. These ﬁndings expand knowledge of the range and diversity of coronaviruses and paramyxoviruses in insectivorous bats in Ethiopia and reinforce that an improved understanding of viral diversity and species-speciﬁc shedding dynamics is important for designing informed zoonotic disease surveillance and spillover risk reduction efforts.",

We show that it is widespread and highly diversiﬁed in Peters’ tentmaking bats (Uroderma bilobatum) within Panama, while local prevalence varied signiﬁcantly between sample sites, ranging from 0 to 14.3%. Females showed signiﬁcantly higher prevalence than males, and pregnant females were more often acutely infected than non-reproductive ones. The distribution of TBHBV in bats was signiﬁcantly affected by forest cover, with higher infection rates in areas with lower forest cover. Our data indicate that loss of natural habitat may lead to positive feedback on the biotic factors driving infection possibility. These results underline the necessity of multidisciplinary studies for a better understanding of mechanisms in pathogen–host relationships and for predictions in disease ecology.",

Pteropus fruit bats have been identiﬁed as potential carriers of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Salmonella Typhi and other Salmonella serotypes in Pteropus giganteus fruit bats in Bangladesh. Rectal swabs were collected from 302 bats and cultured for Salmonella species. The bats were trapped in three districts (Faridpur, Rajbari, and Cox’s Bazar). Salmonella Typhi was not found but one juvenile female bat from Faridpur district was positive for Salmonella Virchow. Close associations between frugivorous bats, humans, and livestock in rural Bangladesh make it likely that the bat was infected by consuming contaminated water.",

            "abstractNote": "Over the past 10 years many ‘‘new’’ viruses have been identiﬁed in Australia and the Asian region. The viruses have been isolated from, and/or identiﬁed in, a range of animals; some of these viruses are of veterinary and medical importance while others are new threats to biodiversity. Of these viruses, Hendra and Nipah viruses have emerged as signiﬁcant zoonotic agents belonging to the family Paramyxoviridae and genus Henipavirus. These agents cause fatalities in a range of animals including horses, pigs, and humans. Both viruses have been isolated from ﬂying foxes (genus Pteropus; suborder Megachiroptera), which are accepted as their natural hosts. Although some research has been undertaken on the viruses and their hosts, little is known about how these viruses emerge. We have attempted to investigate the current knowledge of the bat-Henipavirus ecology by discussing the range of bat viruses that exist (viral assemblage), the signiﬁcance of evolving viruses, possible functional role(s) of viruses, the ecology of viruses and their hosts, and identifying possible drivers (selection pressures) that may culminate with the overlap of new potential viral hosts thereby facilitating the replication of ﬁt viral populations in a new host–virus continuum(s). By undertaking such an analysis, we have attempted to identify key questions, which should be investigated if the factors involved in ‘‘driving’’ Henipavirus emergence are to be understood.",

            "abstractNote": "The distribution ranges and spatio‐temporal patterns in the occurrence and activity of boreal bats are yet largely unknown due to their cryptic lifestyle and lack of suitable and efficient study methods. We approached the issue by establishing a permanent passive‐acoustic sampling setup spanning the area of Finland to gain an understanding on how latitude affects bat species composition and activity patterns in northern Europe. The recorded bat calls were semi‐automatically identified for three target taxa;\n              Myotis\n              spp.,\n              Eptesicus nilssonii\n              or\n              Pipistrellus nathusii\n              and the seasonal activity patterns were modeled for each taxa across the seven sampling years (2015–2021). We found an increase in activity since 2015 for\n              E. nilssonii\n              and\n              Myotis\n              spp. For\n              E. nilssonii\n              and\n              Myotis\n              spp. we found significant latitude ‐dependent seasonal activity patterns, where seasonal variation in patterns appeared stronger in the north. Over the years, activity of\n              P. nathusii\n              increased during activity peak in June and late season but decreased in mid season. We found the passive‐acoustic monitoring network to be an effective and cost‐efficient method for gathering bat activity data to analyze spatio‐temporal patterns. Long‐term data on the composition and dynamics of bat communities facilitates better estimates of abundances and population trend directions for conservation purposes and predicting the effects of climate change.",

Previous analyses studying biogeographic regionalisation across different high‐level taxa have shown similar trends at a global scale. However, incorporating phylogenetic methods when comparing biogeographic regionalisation between subgroups facilitates identification of mechanisms leading to the biogeographic distribution of specific taxa. We analysed the spatial trends of phylogenetic diversity and phylogenetic endemism of 325 species of New World bats, using updated range maps of the modern distributions. These analyses showed phylogeographic signals that reflect the different evolutionary histories of these families. Zoogeographical zones were detected based on range‐weighted phylogenetic turnover. Values of high phylogenetic diversity and endemism were distributed differently across families, suggesting niche conservatism, but a general latitudinal trend of diversity was evident across taxa. Overall, two main bioregions were shared across New World bat taxa (Nearctic and Neotropical), with two additional subregions (Andean and La Platan). We found strong support for an additional transitional zone in the Pacific coast of South America for Emballonuridae and Molossidae. Differences in regionalisation across families indicate that niche conservatism, in situ diversification and dispersal ability are major drivers for the regionalisation of New World bats, within a dual‐centre of diversification scenario. We also found strong inter‐familial support for an independent Caribbean biogeographic region.",

            "abstractNote": "Mexico has higher mammalian diversity than expected for its size and geographic position. High environmental hetero geneity throughout Mexico is hypothesized to promote high turnover rates (β‐diversity), thus contributing more to observed species richness and composition than within‐habitat (α) diversity. This is true if species are strongly associated with their environments, such that changes in environmental attributes will result in changes in species composition. Also, greater heterogeneity in an area will result in greater species richness. This hypothesis has been deemed false for bats, as their ability to fly would reduce opportunities for habitat specialization. If so, we would expect no significant relationships between 1) species composition and environmental variables, 2) species richness and environmental heterogeneity, 3) β‐diversity and environmental heterogeneity. We tested these predictions using 31 bat assemblages distributed across Mexico. Using variance partitioning we evaluated the relative contribution of vegetation, climate, elevation, horizontal heterogeneity (a variate including vegetation, climate, and elevational heterogeneity), spatial variation (lat‐long), and vertical hetero geneity (of vegetation strata) to variation in bat species composition and richness. Variation in vegetation explained 92% of the variation in species composition and was correlated with all other variables examined, indicating that bats respond directly to habitat composition and structure. Beta‐diversity and vegetational heterogeneity were significantly correlated. Bat species richness was significantly correlated with vertical, but not horizontal, heterogeneity. Nonetheless, neither horizontal nor vertical heterogeneity were random; both were related to latitude and to elevation. Variation in bat community composition and richness in Mexico were primarily explained by local landscape heterogeneity and environmental factors. Significant relationships between β‐diversity and environmental variation reveal differences in habitat specialization by bats, and explain their high diversity in Mexico. Understanding mechanisms acting along environmental or geographic gradients is as important for understanding spatial variation in community composition as studying mechanisms that operate at local scales.",

At the same time, morphometric analysis of 21 cranial measurements definitely puts these specimens closer to M. magnater and shows their differences from M. fuliginosus samples from different parts of the species range. We assume that, in the low mountains of northern Vietnam and southern China, M. fuliginosus, due to as yet unknown circumstances, occupies the niche of a larger species.

            "abstractNote": "New World bats represent over one third of global bat species and encompass the widest adaptive radiation among bats. Modern bat diversity in the Americas resulted from a mixture of migrations and colonisations of different taxa throughout the Cenozoic. Traditionally, these taxa are conceived as either South or North American, based on the location of their centres of diversification. To better understand the spatial and temporal processes behind modern biogeographic patterns of New World bat fauna, we investigated phylogenetic diversity (PD) and endemism (PE) for 325 American bat species using distribution maps and a species‐level phylogenetic supertree of bats. Randomisation tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of our results, and to derive a categorical analysis of neo‐ and palaeo‐endemism (CANAPE) to deconstruct significant endemism into its different components. PD and PE showed different patterns than those previously reported for New World bats based on traditional measures of diversity. We found multiple centres of significant endemism across the New World for most bat families, extending the hypothesis of dual centres of diversification, previously proposed for Emballonuridae, Phyllostomidae and Mormoopidae, to Molossidae and Vespertilionidae. Our results indicate that Central America and southern North America played important roles in the diversification of New World bats, as did the Andes in the diversification of Vespertilionidae in South America.",

Comparatively less is known about the potential indirect effects of disease that likely alter community structure and larger ecosystem function. Since 2006, white-nose syndrome (WNS) has resulted in the loss of over 6 million hibernating bats in eastern North America. Considerable evidence exists concerning niche partitioning in sympatric bat species in this region, and the unprecedented, rapid decline in multiple species following WNS may provide an opportunity to observe a dramatic restructuring of the bat community.",
