Cytogenetically, both species differ from other <i>Scotophilus</i> species in the subtelocentric morphology of chromosome 2 and a terminal heterochromatic segment on the X chromosome. Further, <i>Scotophilus</i> sp. nov. is characterized by a subtelocentric chromosome 4 not found in any other <i>Scotophilus</i> species. Comparing the <i>Scotophilus</i> karyotype with that of the vespertilionid genus <i>Myotis</i>, extensive conservation of whole chromosome arms has been found recently. However, out of 25 chromosomal arms six could not be identified in <i>Scotophilus</i>. Therefore, in the present study fluorescence in situ hybridization with whole chromosome painting probes from <i>Myotis myotis</i> was carried out on metaphase preparations from <i>Scotophilus dinganii</i> and <i>Scotophilus </i>sp. nov. These experiments revealed that three previously unidentified <i>Scotophilus</i> chromosomes (A, B, C) contain homologous sequences to <i>Myotis</i> chromosomes 18 plus 22, 19 plus 25, and 16/17, respectively.",

Franquet’s fruit bat (Epomops franqueti) is host to several parasites such as protozoa, bacteria, viruses and mites. Yet, studies exploring the values of its blood components with interest for research or food purposes are scarce. Thus, this study was carried out to investigate the hematological values of the adult E. franqueti.\nMethods: Seventeen (nine female and eight male) apparently healthy adult E. franqueti were captured from their roosting colony. Blood samples were collected for determination of erythrocyte indices [red blood cell count (RBC), packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)] and leukocyte indices [total white blood cell counts (WBC), lymphocytes, eosinophil, monocytes, neutrophil count and erythrocytes osmotic fragility].\nResults: There were no significant (p ≥ 0.05) sex-related differences in RBC, PCV, Hb concentration, MCV, MCH, MCHC and total and differential WBC of E. franqueti. Erythrocyte osmotic fragility was significantly higher in female than in male E. franqueti at 0.1% NaCl.\nConclusions: These considerations are critical in establishing reference ranges of blood parameters for E. franqueti and may provide insight to why they serve as reservoir hosts for several microorganisms.",

The bats can detect and attack rapidly moving targets within the clutter, i.e. below grass panicles, by using prey motion as a cue. Stationary objects are attacked only above the grass, but still within the clutter overlap zone. To test if the bats were guided by flutter from moth wings or by vision when searching for stationary targets, they were presented with male ghost swifts mounted on top of steel wires. There was no difference in attack frequency on live, fluttering moths compared to dead and spread ones. However, when comparing white and dark moths, we found a significantly higher attack frequency on white ones. As the attacks always were guided by echolocation calls, we hypothesize that northern bats, at least in the initial search phase, use visual cues as a complement to detect stationary ghost swifts.",

We observed the bats when foraging on the fruits of Calophyllum inophyllum and on the leaves of Mimusops elengi and Cassia ®stula for 31, 27 and 28 days, respectively at the botanical garden in the Madurai Kamaraj University campus. The number of feeding bouts was recorded every hour between 18:00 and 05:00. A feeding bout involves a bat landing on the tree and collecting a part (or whole) of the fruit or a leaf. The total number of feeding bouts was negatively correlated with per cent moonlight each night. The number of feeding bouts decreased during the waxing phases of the moon. During the period of new moon the mean number of feeding bouts was signi®cantly higher compared to the periods of other phases. During the ®rst quarter and the last quarter phases, feeding occurred more during the dark part of the night, especially when the bats foraged upon M. elengi and C. ®stula. While cloud cover enhanced the foraging activity, lightning and thunder suppressed it. Our study indicates that moonlight in¯uences the foraging activity of C. sphinx.",

            "abstractNote": "The short-nosed fruit bat, Cynopterus sphinx, begins to visit fruitbearing trees about 30 min after sunset. Individual bats often hover near or land on fruits or on nearby branches to remove whole or parts of fruits with their mouth. These bats seldom remain in the fruit-bearing trees to feed, but instead carry fruits to feeding roosts, repeating this behaviour several times throughout the night. Analysis of the temporal distribution of feeding behaviour has revealed two peaks of activity, one in the pre-midnight hours when bats fed mostly on 'steady state' fruits, and another during the post-midnight hours when bats fed on 'big-bang' fruits. Only solitary bats visited and fed on species with steady state fruiting phenologies, whereas groups of bats regularly visited and fed on species with big-bang fruiting phenologies. Thus, plant species which produce large numbers of fruits appear to promote group foraging during the latter hours of the night. It is suggested that the temporal use of available fruits in south India made it possible for C. sphinx to successfully exploit them, and thereby reduced interference competition with conspecifics.",

Predation is typically understood to mean “capture, kill, and eat”. However, none of these aspects had been observed. Moreover, key aspects of bat biology were not taken into account, including that the bat in question was a ﬂightless newborn, the capture of which would require some explanation. We revisit this interesting observation considering both bat and spider ecology.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are ancient hosts of Trypanosoma species and their flying ability, longevity and adaptability to distinct environments indicate that they are efficient dispersers of parasites. Bats from Acre state (Amazon Biome) were collected in four expeditions conducted in an urban forest (Parque Zoobotânico) and one relatively more preserved area (Seringal Cahoeira) in Rio Branco and Xapuri municipalities. Trypanosoma sp. infection was detected by hemoculture and fresh blood examination. Isolated parasite species were identified by the similarity of the obtained DNA sequence from 18S rDNA polymerase chain reaction and reference strains. Overall, 367 bats from 23 genera and 32 species were examined. Chiropterofauna composition was specific to each municipality, although Artibeus sp. and Carollia sp. prevailed throughout. Trypanosoma sp. infection was detected in 85 bats (23·2%). The most widely distributed and prevalent genotypes were (in order) Trypanosoma cruzi TcI, T. cruzi marinkellei, Trypanosoma dionisii, T. cruzi TcIV and Trypanosoma rangeli. At least one still-undescribed Trypanosoma species was also detected in this study. The detection of T. cruzi TcI and TcIV (the ones associated with Chagas disease in Amazon biome) demonstrates the putative importance of these mammal hosts in the epidemiology of the disease in the Acre State.",

Here, we report seasonal, daily and inter-individual variation in three communicative behaviors engaged in by male bats. The frequency of male behaviors identified as scent-marking, vigorous wing-flapping and the making of an openwing gesture were found to vary seasonally, depending on the reproductive status of conspecific females in the study colony. The duration of scent-marking was markedly high during mating seasons, in comparison with wing-flapping and wing-gesturing. In mating seasons, the pattern to the daily variation in behavior correlated strongly with the gender of the responder present in the diurnal roost and/or colony. For instance, scent-marking and vigorous wing-flapping were more frequent during late-evening and early-morning hours, mostly when females were absent from the day roost, while male-male encounters were possible. In contrast, wing-gesturing was more frequent during morning and early-evening hours, when females were present in the day roost. The results from our study suggest that male scent-marking and wing-flapping are directed towards competitor males in the colony, with a view to resource-defense behavior being manifested. Furthermore, male wing-gesturing is predicted to be directed towards co-roosting females, with the aim in this case being for some form of social information to be communicated, particularly during the mating season. However, marginal inter-individual variation in the frequency of occurrence of behaviors between seasons was apparent, suggesting that these communicative behaviors could be tied to male-male competition in this species.",

At birth, neonates’ average and standard deviation of body mass, length of forearm, and length of epiphyseal gap were 2.57 ± 0.33 g, 17.37 ± 1.60 mm, and 2.65 ± 0.42 mm, respectively. Body mass and forearm length of pups increased monotonically until 20 days, when they achieved 72.37% and 91.70% of the values of postpartum females and thereafter growth rates decreased. Epiphyseal gap length increased to its maximum size at about 8–10 days after birth and subsequently decreased. Wing ­characteristics including wingspan, wing area, handwing length, handwing area, armwing length, and armwing area increased monotonically until the age of the first flight, after which growth rates significantly declined (all P < 0.05). Pups achieved sustained flight at 25–30 days of age. Wing loading of pups was 11.28 ± 1.27 Nm–2 and decreased monotonically to 5.99 ± 0.68 Nm–2, but aspect ratio remained fairly constant. Regression analysis indicates that handwing length and forearm length provide the most accurate estimate age of the young of My. emarginatus.",

The objective of this study was to use mitochondrial sequence data to test hypotheses of relationship within Nyctinomops. A total of 460 bases of cytochrome b and 686 bases of NADH dehydrogenase were sequenced and analyzed from 22 individuals by use of parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian methods. Sequences from other molossid genera (Tadarida, Cynomops, and Otomops) were used as outgroups. In addition, a series of Nyctinomops specimens from Peru was re-assessed using morphological and molecular data. Our results agree with previous studies using morphological similarity in the placement of the largest member of the genus, N. macrotis, as sister to the remaining species. Furthermore, both mitochondrial data sets recovered the following relationship for the other members of the genus: (N. aurispinosus (N. laticaudatus, N. femorosaccus)).",

The content of the samples, collected in October and November of 1995 and in September and October of 1996 and 1997, consisted mainly of bird feathers identi®ed as those of the robin Erithacus rubecula and the blue tit Parus caeruleus. The presence of feathers during the 3 consecutive years of the study period con®rms that the diet of the greater noctule in this area is not based exclusively on arthropods as was previously suggested.",

            "abstractNote": "BACKGROUND: Cryptococcus neoformans is responsible of cryptococcosis, a life-threatening infection that affects healthy and immunocompromised individuals. It is the first cause of adult acute meningitis in some sub-Saharan African countries with a mortality rate of about 100% in cases of inappropriate therapy. This study aimed at examining the occurrence and the antifungal patterns of Cryptococcus isolates from pigeon droppings and bat guanos in the west region of Cameroon.\nMETHODS: A total of 350 samples were randomly collected from three selected localities of west region of Cameroon. The identification was performed based on capsule production assessed by Indian ink preparation. Additional tests performed were urea broth, glycine and tryptophan assimilation tests. The antifungal susceptibility test was performed by the broth microdilution method.\nRESULTS: Mycological analysis led to the identification of 98 isolates, of which 57 isolates of C. neoformans var. gattii and 41 isolates of C. neoformans var. neoformans. All the isolates showed resistance to antifungals tested except nystatin which showed MIC mean values ranging between 0.5 µg/mL and 0.65 µg/mL.\nCONCLUSION: The prevalence of C. neoformans in pigeons and bats excreta in the west region of Cameroon is 28.57 %. C. neoformans var. gattii and C. neoformans var. neoformans are the main serotypes. Isolates found to be resistant to fluconazole and ketoconazole. Our results emphasize the need for further study on the molecular epidemiology in comparison with clinical isolates.",

This data set consisted of an X-linked nuclear intron (Bgn; 543 bp), mitochondrial DNA (cytb-tRNA-control region; 1630 bp) and eight variable microsatellite loci for up to 373 individuals from 86 localities. Using this data set of diverse markers, it was possible to determine the species’ demography at three temporal stages. Nuclear intron data revealed early colonization into Europe from the east, which pre-dates the Quaternary glaciations. The mtDNA data supported multiple glacial refugia across the Mediterranean, the largest of which were found in the IberoMaghreb region and an eastern location (Anatolia/Middle East)–that were used by R. hipposideros during the most recent glacial cycles. Finally, microsatellites provided the most recent information on these species’ movements since the Last Glacial Maximum and suggested that lineages that had diverged into glacial refugia, such as in the Ibero-Maghreb region, have remained isolated. These ﬁndings should be used to inform future conservation management strategies for R. hipposideros and show the power of using a multimarker data set for phylogeographic studies.",

            "abstractNote": "Identifying and characterizing trophic linkages is fundamental to understanding how prey availability affects predator behavior, distribution, and density, and to elucidating the extent to which predators regulate prey populations. Vertebrate insectivores, such as bats, are a pervasive top-down force on insect populations in forest ecosystems. Bats are predators sensitive to habitat perturbations, whose prey selection behavior warrants further study. We identiﬁed trophic connections between a forest bat (Myotis septentrionalis) and its prey by isolating and sequencing cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) fragments of insect prey obtained from bat fecal samples. Prey identities were inferred using GenBank and the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD). We also identiﬁed prey remains morphologically from the same fecal samples, allowing comparisons across novel (GenBank and BOLD) and traditional (morphological) techniques. Lepidopterans were the most frequently detected prey in all approaches. Detection of common insect orders varied across procedures (P , 0.001), suggesting methodological bias at coarse taxonomic resolutions. Of the DNA-based approaches, GenBank provided the more diverse assessment of prey. We reveal trophic linkages for northern bats by identifying 20 prey genera and species using BOLD, more than one-half of which were smaller lepidopterans. The disproportionate number of smaller lepidopteran prey (mean [6SE] wingspan 24.2 6 2.05 mm) exceeded expectations based on ﬁeld-based assessments. M. septentrionalis is known to use both aerial-hawking and gleaning behaviors. Lepidopteran prey consumed by M. septentrionalis were smaller than reported for conspecﬁc genera, suggesting this species differentiates itself from sympatric insectivorous bats with the prey it selects.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats in the genus Corynorhinus possess a suite of morphological characters that permit them to effectively use both gleaning and aerial-hawking foraging strategies to capture Lepidoptera. Consequently, they occupy a specialized feeding niche within North American bat assemblages and are of particular interest for dietary studies. We collected fecal pellets from a colony of C. rafinesquii (Rafinesque’s Big-Eared Bat) at Mammoth Cave National Park during August–October 2011 and amplified cytochrome-c oxidase subunit 1 fragments of prey from these pellets. We used the Barcode of Life Database to identify prey, and evaluated the size of prey species based on published values. The mean wingspan of prey we recorded from our samples was smaller than average values reported for Rafinesque’s Big-Eared Bat using traditional methods (P ≤ 0.01), suggesting that surveys of culled insect parts beneath roosting sites may lead to biased estimates of the size and breadth of prey species eaten by gleaning bats. Mean wingspan of lepidopteran prey consumed by Rafinesque’s Big-Eared Bat in our study was larger (P ≤ 0.01) than values reported for the Myotis septentrionalis (Northern Long-Eared Bat ), which is a smaller, sympatric gleaner in eastern North America. Further, comparisons of our diet data with abundance of prey suggest macrolepidopteran taxa are consistently consumed by Rafinesque’s Big-Eared Bat to greater degree than microlepidotera. Our findings suggest that North American Corynorhinus consume a wider range of sizes and species of Lepidoptera than previously reported in studies based solely on identification of culled prey-wings beneath feeding roosts.",

However, none of this work has focused on the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), one of the most common bats in North America. Previous work using mark–recapture suggests that like many mammals, including other temperate vespertilionid bats, gene flow in this species is largely driven by males, whereas females return to the roosts in which they were born to rear pups. To determine if this species displays a pattern of population genetic structure that is consistent with this hypothesis I sampled 182 female M. lucifugus at 12 maternity colonies throughout Minnesota. Using a portion of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b and 10 polymorphic nuclear microsatellites, I found significant structure among colonies, and population differentiation was slightly higher for the mitochondrial locus. This supports the hypothesis that female M. lucifugus display some degree of natal philopatry, but the inferred female dispersal rate was high. The pattern of structure was complex and demonstrates that unequal gene flow among maternity colonies is occurring and that the co-occurrence of breeding populations within maternity colonies and/or inbreeding could be confounding estimates of population genetic structure among these colonies. The patterns of population genetic structure and natal philopatry imply that both seasonal migration and dispersal by females should be considered as possible factors in the spread of emerging infectious diseases such as white-nose syndrome.",

Mammals were the second most important prey. Mammals were the major food item throughout the seasons and their contribution to the diet ranged from 50.7% in spring to 73.6% in summer. Birds were the second numerous prey with 8.1% in summer and 29.6% in spring. The dominant prey species was Myotis sp., making up 37.8%. It was followed by Gerbillus nanus (5.4%), Columba livia (4.3%) and Bufo mauritanicus (4.1%).",

This study investigates the role of bat-induced pollination in baobab fruiting. Materials and methods. The tree was studied in three diﬀerent climatic regions in Benin Republic: Matéri, Dassa-Zoume and Come-Houéyogbé, representing the Northern, Central and Southern parts of the country, respectively. Tree size (diameter at breast height, height, crown diameter) and ﬂower size (sepals and petals length and width) were measured from each of the trees in the study areas and ﬂower visitation by bats was monitored. Bats’ contribution to pollination success was also evaluated by monitoring caged and free ﬂowers. Results and discussion. There were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in tree and ﬂower sizes among the three regions. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were also observed in the mean number of bat visits per tree and pollination success among tree populations, but, fruit set per tree was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent among baobab populations, at least in the ﬁrst 8 weeks. In all populations, ﬂower abortion was signiﬁcantly elevated in caged ﬂowers. Conclusion. Based on ﬁndings of this study, it can be concluded that bat-pollination increases the fruit set rate, making it an important factor for in situ regeneration of baobab trees in the country.",

            "abstractNote": "With the loss and modification of natural roosting habitat afforded by caves, abandoned mines have assumed increased importance as alternative roosting sites for Townsend’s big-eared bats (Corynorhinus townsendii). However, increased human safety concerns have led to accelerated abandoned mine closure programs. To protect roosting sites in mines with significant bat activity, bat-compatible gates are installed that allow continued access to mine workings. Aside from ensuring public safety, these gates provide protection from disturbance to roosting bats. We evaluated the effects of gating on bat flight behavior at maternity colonies in 2 previously gated (control) and 2 ungated (treatment) mines that were gated during this study. We used an infrared video camera to record bat flight behavior at the entrances to each of the 4 study mines for 2 consecutive mornings and a single night each month during the warm season. Entrance (03:00–06:00) and emergence (21:00–24:00) surveys comprised 3 consecutive hours. Overall circling activity increased more than 6-fold at openings of treatment mines following gating (P < 0.001). Crowding during emergence was significantly higher (P = 0.023) in newly gated mines than in previously gated mines. Gates affect subadults during the initial-volancy periods, as detected through collisions with the gates. Increased activity of bats and collisions with the gate, which result in bats falling to the ground at mine openings, may amplify vulnerability to predators and increase energetic demands.",

We aimed to assess the dispersal and distribution of mtDNA lineages of G. soricina and evaluate the possible effect of vicariant events in the population history and dynamics. Glossophaga soricina presented two main highly supported mtDNA lineages, which diverged between »2.4 and 5 million years ago, probably following a vicariant event caused by the Andes ﬁnal uplift. The lower sea level during Pleistocene glaciations also made possible the occupation of Jamaica after an event of dispersion over the Caribbean Sea, although past climatic ﬂuctuations had little effect over population dynamics of G. soricina. Our results corroborate the idea that the Andes uplift played an important role in the evolution of Neotropical biodiversity. In this context we suggest that geographic events causing large scale environmental disjunction, such as the uplift of mountains, are more likely to restrict gene ﬂow amongst populations of tolerant species with broad geographic range than local climate driven environmental changes.",

Brazilian urban areas contain many species of bats, especially insectivorous bats, that are attracted by a wide range of readily available food and shelter. From August 2003 to December 2008, we analysed 2427 bats in the Sa˜ o Paulo State region. Homogenates of the livers and spleens of the bats were plated on speciﬁc medium to identify animals infected with H. capsulatum. The fungus was isolated from 87 bats (3.6%). The infected bats were identiﬁed as Molossus molossus (74), Nyctinomops macrotis (10), Tadarida brasiliensis (1), Molossus rufus (1) and Eumops glaucinus (1), all insectivorous species. The data presented are a relevant contribution to the epidemiology of H. capsulatum in densely populated urban areas such as in Sa˜ o Paulo State, especially since histoplasmosis is not included in the mandatory disease notiﬁcation system.",

Here, we investigated the ecological and evolutionary forces acting on the diversiﬁcation of an emerging bacterial pathogen, Leptospira spp., in communities of endemic Malagasy small mammals. We determined the infection rate with pathogenic Leptospira in 20 species of sympatric rodents (subfamily Nesomyinae) and tenrecids (family Tenrecidae) at two eastern humid forest localities. A multilocus genotyping analysis allowed the characterization of bacterial diversity within small mammals and gave insights into their genetic relationships with Leptospira infecting endemic Malagasy bats (family Miniopteridae and Vespertilionidae). We report for the ﬁrst time the presence of pathogenic Leptospira in Malagasy endemic small mammals, with an overall prevalence of 13%. In addition, these hosts harbour species of Leptospira (L. kirschneri, L. borgpetersenii and L. borgpetersenii group B) which are different from those reported in introduced rats (L. interrogans) on Madagascar. The diversiﬁcation of Leptospira on Madagascar can be traced millions of years into evolutionary history, resulting in the divergence of endemic lineages and strong host speciﬁcity. These observations are discussed in relation to the relative roles of endemic vs. introduced mammal species in the evolution and epidemiology of Leptospira on Madagascar, speciﬁcally how biodiversity and biogeographical processes can shape community ecology of an emerging pathogen and lead to its diversiﬁcation within native animal communities.",

            "abstractNote": "The Neotropical genus Psittacanthus comprises mostly specialized ornithophilous mistletoes, with rare exceptions. Psittacanthus robustus is a common ornithophilous species from the South American savannas whose bright yellow flowers secrete copious diluted nectar. Due to a three-­day-­long anthesis and a short, non-r­ estrictive floral tube, we suggest that the species also serves as a resource for flower-­visiting bats. In a Cerrado area in central Brazil, we investigated the usage of the species by bats through systematic bat captures for pollen sampling, its nocturnal nectar secretion dynamics, mating system, and the relative dependence on diurnal and nocturnal pollinators for reproduction. Nine phyllostomid bat species visited P. robustus. Up to 50% of pollen samples from bats contained the species during peak flowering, equating or surpassing the prevalence of chiropterophilous species and representing roughly a third of the floral resources consumed by specialized nectarivores Glossophaga soricina and Anoura caudifer. Flowers actively produced nectar at night with volume and concentration values in the ideal ranges for bat consumption. Nectar is continuously secreted after sunset and accumulates in the absence of visitors. Psittacanthus robustus is self-­compatible but seeds are set mostly by diurnal visitors. Nocturnal animals had a low and secondary contribution to plant fitness. This is the second report of bat pollination for the genus Psittacanthus, and the largest assemblage of bat visitors for the family Loranthaceae. Although ornithophilous, P. robustus is an important resource for bats in the Brazilian savanna, potentially representing a mixed or early transitional state toward bat pollination.",

Neotropical bats have been poorly studied, and important aspects on sperm morphology have not been elucidated. The aim of the present study was to describe and compare the sperm morphology and morphometry of Molossus molossus and Molossops temminckii. A total of 14 adults specimens were analyzed from the Coleccio n Mamíferos Lillo, Universidad Nacional de Tucumán: five M. molossus and nine M. temminckii. The epididymis were extracted and macerated in Farmer's solution, followed by a coloration with different stains. To carry out the description and morphometric analysis, microphotographs were taken under an optical, epifluorescence, and scanning electron microscope (SEM). A total of 50 sperm from each individual were measured for morphometric analysis. The length and width of the head, midpiece and tail were taken as variables. Sperm from M. molossus and M. temminckii were practically identical, both morphologically and morphometrically. In both species, a distal bulge was observed at the end of the intermediate piece in a percentage greater than 85%. The main characteristics shared between the species were: presence of acrosomal blebs in the upper half of the head of the spermatozoa; cephalic equatorial segment with filiform ornamentations; intermembrane space of head apex wedge-shaped; helical middle piece and annulus at the end of middle piece. In the present study, SEM allowed us to visualize structures, such as acrosomal vesicles, that were not detected with other types of microscopy.",

We hypothesized that repeated exposure to the anticoagulants in the bats’ saliva generated an immune response. We compared clotting time of blood mixed with Desmodus saliva between individuals of several species of livestock that were regularly exposed to vampire bats (‘‘batattacked’’) and individuals living where bat predation was not observed (‘‘bat-na¨ıve’’). We also compared the bleeding times of domestic sheep following a single defensive bite from a bat, before and after subjecting the animals to a series of feeding bites by Desmodus. Clotting time was significantly shorter in bat-attacked than in bat-na¨ıve livestock. Bleeding time after a provoked defensive bat bite was significantly shorter after sheep were exposed to a series of feeding bites from Desmodus. Bat predation induced increased resistance by the prey against the anticoagulants, suggesting an immune response.",

            "abstractNote": "Primary and secondary poisoning of nontarget wildlife with second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides has led to restrictions on their use and to increased use of firstgeneration anticoagulants, including diphacinone. Although first-generation anticoagulants are less potent and less persistent than second-generation compounds, their use is not without risks to nontarget species. We report the first known mortalities of threatened New Zealand lesser shorttailed bats (Mystacina tuberculata) caused by diphacinone intoxication. The mortalities occurred during a rodent control operation in Pureora Forest Park, New Zealand, during the 2008–2009 Austral summer. We observed 115 lesser short-tailed bat deaths between 9 January and 6 February 2009, and it is likely that many deaths were undetected. At necropsy, adult bats showed gross and histologic hemorrhages consistent with coagulopathy, and diphacinone residues were confirmed in 10 of 12 liver samples tested. The cause of mortality of pups was diagnosed as a combination of the effects of diphacinone toxicity, exposure, and starvation. Diphacinone was also detected in two of 11 milk samples extracted from the stomachs of dead pups. Eight adults and 20 pups were moribund when found. Two adults and five pups survived to admission to a veterinary hospital. Three pups responded to treatment and were released at the roost site on 17 March, 2009. The route of diphacinone ingestion by adult bats is uncertain. Direct consumption of toxic bait or consumption of poisoned arthropod prey could have occurred. We suggest that the omnivorous diet and terrestrial feeding habits of lesser short-tailed bats make them susceptible to poisoning with the bait matrix and the method of bait delivery used. We recommend the use of alternative vertebrate pesticides, bait matrices, and delivery methods in bat habitat.",

This species has been recorded only from four locations, in India and Cambodia, with the type locality in the Barapede caves, India. In this paper, we present an analysis of echolocation and social calls of O. wroughtoni from the Barapede caves. Echolocation calls of free-flying O. wroughtoni were narrowband and shallow frequency-modulated (shallow-FM), with peak frequency ranging between 14–17 kHz. Social call sequences of roosting O. wroughtoni showed five distinct signatures. Multivariate analyses of echolocation calls of O. wroughtoni and the other three molossid species found in India (Tadarida teniotis, T. aegyptiaca, Chaerephon plicatus), showed strong support for acoustic differentiation of these species. Our study will help identify probable occurrence of O. wroughtoni and the other species in unsurveyed areas through field acoustic surveys. It also proposes hypotheses about the ecology and foraging behaviour of O. wroughtoni that could be tested through further studies.",

It is thought to derive from\n              Trypanosoma brucei\n              by deletion of the maxicircle kinetoplastic DNA (genetic material required for cyclical development in tsetse flies). It is mostly mechanically transmitted by tabanids and stomoxes, initially to camels, in sub-Saharan area. The disease spread from North Africa towards the Middle East, Turkey, India, up to 53° North in Russia, across all South-East Asia, down to Indonesia and the Philippines, and it was also introduced by the conquistadores into Latin America. It can affect a very large range of domestic and wild hosts including camelids, equines, cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs and other carnivores, deer, gazelles, and elephants. It found a new large range of wild and domestic hosts in Latin America, including reservoirs (capybaras) and biological vectors (vampire bats). Surra is a major disease in camels, equines, and dogs, in which it can often be fatal in the absence of treatment, and exhibits nonspecific clinical signs (anaemia, loss of weight, abortion, and death), which are variable from one host and one place to another; however, its immunosuppressive effects interfering with intercurrent diseases or vaccination campaigns might be its most significant and questionable aspect.",

            "abstractNote": "The ability to create shelters that provide protection from the environment is widespread among animals. However, in spite of the central role roosts play in the life of bats (Chiroptera), only a few species have developed the ability to make their own refuges, one of them being the Neotropical Lophostoma silvicolum. This bat creates and inhabits cavities in active arboreal nests of the termite Nasutitermes corniger. We measured temperature in cavities inside active and dead termite nests. and in tree holes occupied by closely related bats, to determine whether energetic benefits compensate for the cost of excavating the hard nests. The inside temperatures of active termite nests were very stable and 2.1-2.8degreesC warmer than those of the other two potential roost types. The observed temperature difference is estimated to allow euthermic L. silvicolum to save about 5% of their daily energy expenditure when roosting in active termite nests instead of dead nests or tree holes. Suitable roosting conditions result from the presence of termites and are independent of nest architecture. Our results indicate that the benefits of higher temperatures may be one of the driving forces promoting the evolution of active roost making in bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Shelters are important for the survival and reproduction of many animals and this is particularly true for bats. Depending on the future use and effect of shelters on the ﬁtness of individuals, not all members of a group of animals may contribute equally to shelter making. Thus, knowledge about the identity of shelter-making individuals may teach us much about the social system and mating strategy of species. To exemplify this, we review what is known about the roost-making behavior and the social system of Lophostoma silvicolum, a neotropical bat that excavates roost cavities in active arboreal termite nests. Roosts in termite nests are highly beneﬁcial for the bats because they offer improved microclimate and possibly are responsible for the lower parasite loads of L. silvicolum in comparison to bat species using other, more common, roost types. Examination of observational ﬁeld data in combination with genetic analyses shows that roost cavities excavated by single males subsequently serve as maternity roosts for females and that this improves reproductive success of the male who excavated the roost. This suggests that roosts in termite nests serve as an extended male phenotype and roost making is a sexually selected behavior. Roost-making behavior is tightly linked to the species’ social organization (single-male–multifemale associations that stay together year-round) and mating system (resourcedefense polygyny). The case study of L. silvicolum shows that it is important to learn more about the implications of shelter making in bats and other animals from ongoing and future studies. However, differences in costs and beneﬁts for each group member must be carefully evaluated before drawing conclusions about social systems and mating strategies in order to contribute to our current knowledge about the evolution of sociality in mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Northern yellow bats (Dasypterus intermedius) are tree-roosting bats in the family Vespertilionidae comprised of two subspecies: D. intermedius intermedius and D. intermedius floridanus. The two subspecies are thought to be geographically separated. Due to their cryptic morphology, this hypothesis has never been tested and can benefit from being examined within a molecular framework. In this study, mitochondrial sequence data from 38 D. intermedius and nuclear sequence data from 14 D. intermedius from across their range were used to test the hypothesis that genetically defined groups correspond geographically with the two morphologically defined subspecies. Although high levels of divergence of the mitochondrial sequence (11.6%) suggest genetically distinct clusters sympatric in southern Texas, no genetic structure was recovered with the nuclear marker. Moreover, the mitochondrial sequence data recovered a paraphyletic relationship between the two subspecies of D. intermedius with the Cuban yellow bat (D. insularis), whereas no such paraphyly was recovered from analysis of the nuclear marker. Divergence time based on analyses of mitochondrial sequence for the two subspecies was approximately 5.5 Ma. The patterns observed are hypothesized to be the result of past isolation of lineages and secondary contact that is currently contributing to gene flow.",

            "abstractNote": "ABSTRACT\n            \n              The pallid bat (\n              Antrozous pallidus\n              ) listens to prey‐generated noise to localize and hunt terrestrial prey while reserving echolocation to avoid obstacles. The thalamocortical connections in the pallid bat are organized as parallel pathways that may serve echolocation and prey localization behaviors. Thalamic inputs to the cortical echolocation call‐ and noise‐selective regions originate primarily in the suprageniculate nucleus (SG) and ventral division of medial geniculate body (MGBv), respectively. Here we examined the distribution of parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB) expression in cortical regions and thalamic nuclei of these pathways. Electrophysiology was used to identify cortical regions selective for echolocation calls and noise. Immunohistochemistry was used to stain for PV and CB in the auditory cortex and MGB. A higher percentage (relative to Nissl‐stained cells) of PV\n              +\n              cells compared with CB\n              +\n              cells was found in both echolocation call‐ and noise‐selective regions. This was due to differences in cortical layers V–VI, but not layers I–IV. In the MGB, CB\n              +\n              cells were present across all divisions of the MGB, with a higher percentage in the MGBv than the SG. Perhaps the most surprising result was the virtual absence of PV staining in the MGBv. PV staining was present only in the SG. Even in the SG, the staining was mostly diffuse in the neuropil. These data support the notion that calcium binding proteins are differentially distributed in different processing streams. Our comparative data, however, do not support a general mammalian pattern of PV/CB staining that distinguishes lemniscal and nonlemniscal pathways. J. Comp.

For bats, the availability and environmental condition of caves can be a limiting factor. The cave specialist Natalus macrourus (formerly Natalus espiritosantensis) is categorized as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List but as Vulnerable in Brazil, based on a projected population reduction and a decline in its area of occupancy, extent of occurrence and/or quality of habitat. There is a lack of knowledge about the species’ distribution, natural history and ecology, information that is required for conservation. Using new occurrence data and potential distribution modelling we evaluated the distribution of N. macrourus in Brazil, analysed pressures on and threats to the species, and assessed the species’ conservation needs. Natalus macrourus is positively associated with areas with higher probability of cave occurrence and negatively associated with areas of high variation in mean daily temperature and mean annual rainfall. Areas with high environmental suitability for N. macrourus correspond to only % of the potential distribution modelled. We estimate that the species has already lost % of its natural habitat and that there is , % of habitat remaining in areas with high environmental suitability. We calculated that approximately half of the caves in areas with high environmental suitability are ,  km from mining operations and only % of the species’ potential distribution lies within protected areas. Given the strong association of N. macrourus with caves, it is important to protect these habitats, and we recommend that caves where the species is present should receive immediate protection.",

Several species of bats have adapted to a variety of food resources and shelters in urban areas. This study aimed to detect Leishmania spp. DNA in bats present in forest fragments located in metropolitan areas endemic for leishmaniasis in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Brazil. Blood samples were obtained from 80 individuals, including eight species of Phyllostomidae and one species of Vespertilionidae. Thirty of the 80 bats were positive for Leishmania spp. using conventional PCR, all belonging to the family Phyllostomidae. Eighteen samples tested by real-time PCR (qPCR) using speciﬁc primers for the kDNA of Leishmania infantum were positive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report detecting Leishmania spp. in Platyrrhinus incarum in addition to being the ﬁrst reported detection of L. infantum in the bat species Phyllostomus discolor, Platyrrhinus lineatus, Artibeus planirostris and Artibeus lituratus. Our results show that bats can host Leishmania spp. in areas endemic for leishmaniasis, which must be taken into account in disease control operations by public health authorities.",

The first bat was captured and killed by a domestic cat in a suburban area of the municipality of Patos, Paraiba, northeastern Brazil. The second bat was found crawling on the ground in the same area before dying. No gross lesions were found at necropsy. Histology of the central nervous system revealed filarioid nematodes in the brain ventricles and cerebellum. There were adults, subadults and eggs, the latter sometimes containing microfilariae. No inflammatory response was observed in bat 1, while bat 2 presented a mild lymphoplasmacytic meningoencephalitis. Three nematodes were recovered and submitted for parasitological examination. The diagnosis of M. wimsatti infection was based on the histomorphological and parasitological characteristics of the agent and its location in the brain ventricular system of insectivorous bats. The infection likely occurs in other insectivorous bats from South American and Caribbean countries but may be overlooked.",

It is widely distributed and sometimes very abundant in different Brazilian biomes, in natural and anthropic environments. Studies in the tropics have found evidence of a decrease in A. lituratus captures during the winter, a dry and cold season with low fruit availability, especially in higher latitudes. However, the causes for the decrease in captures are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to test the influence of temperature and fruit availability on capture rates of A. lituratus in a fragmented Atlantic Forest landscape. Results indicate that temperature is the main variable that explains the changes in the number of captures of A. lituratus throughout the year, and that fruit availability plays only an adjacent role. In addition, we highlight possible negative consequences of climate change on the survival of this species.",

Their body surface can also be colonized by fungal commensals or carry transient fungal species and participate in their dispersal. The present study aimed to assess the presence of P. destructans in Northern Belgium, to describe the skin mycobiome of active bats during summer and autumn, and to analyze possible differences in fungal diversity among bat species, sampling sites, and seasons. In total, 114 bat specimens belonging to seven species were sampled from various localities. Culture-based methods revealed an important mycological diversity with 209 different taxa. Overall, a mean of 3.7 taxa per bat was recorded but significant differences were observed between sampling sites and seasons with a higher diversity in autumn as compared to summer. The mycobiomes were dominated by cosmopolitan and plant-associated species, in particular from the genera Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Aspergillus. Other species known to be related to bats or their environment, like Apiotrichum otae, were also retrieved. Although P. destructans was not detected, the sampling of the hibernacula indicated that they can be inhabited by diverse fungal species including a yet undescribed Pseudogymnoascus species, distinct from P. destructans, namely P. cavicola, sp. nov.",

There were signiﬁcant differences between the two species in relation to ﬂying time, mean maximum distances travelled from the roost, numbers of foraging bouts made and span of home ranges. The results suggest that P. pipistrellus makes more ﬂights to a greater number of foraging locations (and possibly) feeding habitats than P. pygmaeus, although these foraging areas are likely to be closer to the roosts. This behaviour is particularly marked during lactation. In contrast, P. pygmaeus spends less time ﬂying, makes fewer foraging bouts but travels further distances, suggesting that this species is selecting speciﬁc foraging habitats. These differences in foraging behaviour support the hypothesis that these species occupy different ecological niches, and conservation planners should be aware of these differences when considering the requirements of pipistrelles in the UK.",

If information on basal levels of circulating leukocytes is a goal, these two methods may provide different information, since recent evidence indicates that animals that enter cage traps experience stress, and, elevated stress hormones are known to alter leukocyte numbers in circulation by lowering lymphocyte and raising heterophil numbers. We tested this idea using a study of Black-chested Spiny-tailed iguanas (\n              Ctenosaura melanosterna\n              ), which were captured using cage traps () and noose (). Based on cell counts made from blood smears, iguanas caught with cage traps had significantly greater relative and absolute numbers of heterophils and higher heterophil-lymphocyte (H-L) ratios than those captured by noose. Cage-trapped animals also had a nonsignificant reduction in lymphocyte numbers. Similar trends were observed in animals captured with both methods. These patterns are consistent with the effects of stress hormones on white blood cell distributions and indicate that caution must be taken in interpreting leukocyte data from studies of wild animals captured with cage traps.",

All cases were found during the day, in different neighborhoods, prostrate and unable to fly. No significant lesions were observed at necropsy or on histologic examination. The brains of the five bats showed strong immunohistochemical labeling for rabies virus in the form of large corpuscles or multiple clusters of granules within the perikarya of neurons in different areas of the brain, mainly in the cerebral cortex and cerebellar Purkinje cells. Three bats tested by direct immunofluorescence and mouse inoculation were also positive for rabies. These data demonstrate that M. molossus may be infected with the rabies virus and develop rabies, even without histologic lesions in the central nervous system, and can be a source of infection for humans and domestic animals.",

A recent phylogeographical study using molecular markers described a scenario in which this species is formed by 5 distinct geographically circumscribed mitochondrial clades. Here we studied the craniometric variation of the common vampire bat to assess the amount of subdivision within this species and to test for the possibility of distinct morphological patterns associated with geographical lineages. We used 16 measurements from 1,581 complete skulls of adult D. rotundus representing 226 localities in South America and Mesoamerica. The assessment of morphological diversity between groups was done by the estimation of minimum FST values. Overall, the results show that most of the within-species variation is a result of the size component. Both shape data and size data are correlated with geographic distances. Our results favor the origin of biological diversity as the outcome of genetic drift and stepping-stone pattern of gene flow instead of local adaptations to local environmental conditions. The FST analyses also support male-biased dispersal. The results give little evidence to support previous suggestions that the common vampire bat may be composed of 2 or more species.",

Specifically, we tested the following predictions: 1) females will bring forward their emergence time from their roosts and increase foraging bout length progressively from the first through the second trimesters of pregnancy, and during nursing as their pups grow; but, that 2) during the last trimester of pregnancy, namely, in the final stages of foetus development, females will emerge later and there will be a reduction in foraging effort (time); and that 3) females will spend more time foraging during nursing than during pregnancy. We found that the bats emerged from their roosts to forage earlier during the first trimester, but not during the last two trimesters of pregnancy, and that they did not change their emergence time as nursing progressed. Bats that emerged later at night during pregnancy spent more time foraging, and, except for the third trimester, the length of the first daily foraging bout increased as both pregnancy and nursing progressed. Total daily foraging time increased as pregnancy and nursing progressed. Generally, these results support our hypothesis; through adjustment of their foraging behavior as embryos and pups develop, breeding female Hemprich's long-eared bats contend with the potentially conflicting food requirements of their offspring and their own needs.",

Thirty males (17 adults and 13 juveniles) were captured using net, weighed, aged using relative ossification of the wing bone, and dissected and reproductive tissue was processed for histomorphometry. On the basis of histological sections, the structures of a pair of testis containing the seminiferous tubules of adults were compacted in organization with spermatogenic cells. The epididymis has a thinner muscular region than the vas deferens with longitudinal folds on the mucosal lining. Two portions were observed in the prostate gland, while seminal vesicle has numerous trabeculae and bulbourethral gland was observed to have multiacini. There was increase in thickness of muscular region, epithelial height, and luminal diameter of epididymis and vas deferens between adults and juveniles. This work has documented the histology of the male reproductive system in bats, and ultrastructure and histochemistry are recommended for further insight into the reproductive biology.",

            "abstractNote": "Since 2006, bat populations in North America have suffered devastating mortality from an emerging disease known as white-nose syndrome (WNS). The causal agent of WNS is the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. In April 2014, WNS was discovered in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) in Michigan, US, and has since been documented in 12 counties. Because current surveillance for WNS focuses primarily on mine-hibernating species in winter, it is subject to geographic, species, and seasonal bias. To investigate species affected and potential associations of gender, seasonal life cycle, and region with P. destructans prevalence, 1,040 rabies-negative bats were sampled from May 2014 to May 2015 from animals submitted as part of statewide rabies surveillance. The vast majority (96%) of the sample population consisted of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), a noncavernicolous species. Two methods were used to detect P. destructans: fluorescence of the muzzle, wing, and tail membranes under ultraviolet light and PCR targeting genomic DNA on wing samples. Only five bats (0.5%), all M. lucifugus, were confirmed positive after nucleic acid sequencing of PCR amplicons. No other species were infected. All infected bats were collected from April to May, coinciding with their emergence from hibernation. As P. destructans and WNS spread westward, novel surveillance streams may provide a useful tool for wildlife management agencies seeking to detect the fungus where winter hibernacula such as caves and mines are absent or otherwise inaccessible.",

While M. yumanensis populations currently appear relatively stable, it is one of 12 bat species known or suspected to be susceptible to white-nose syndrome, the fungal disease causing declines in bat populations across North America. Only two of these 12 species have genome resources available, which limits the ability of resource managers to use genomic techniques to track the responses of bat populations to white-nose syndrome generally. Here we present the first de novo genome assembly for Yuma myotis, generated as a part of the California Conservation Genomics Project. The M. yumanensis genome was generated using a combination of PacBio HiFi long reads and Omni-C chromatin-proximity sequencing technology. This high-quality genome is one of the most complete bat assemblies available, with a contig N50 of 28.03 Mb, scaffold N50 of 99.14 Mb, and BUSCO completeness score of 93.7%. The Yuma myotis genome provides a high-quality resource that will aid in comparative genomic and evolutionary studies, as well as inform conservation management related to white-nose syndrome.",

Wild mammals are the natural reservoirs of these parasites, which are transmitted by hematophagous arthropods. The present study aimed to detect the natural occurrence of trypanosomatids through serological diagnosis, PCR of whole blood and blood culture (hemoculture), and phylogenetic relationships using small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA), cytochrome b, and glycosomal glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) genes. Samples from 131 wild animals, including rodents, marsupials, and bats, were sampled in six areas in the state of Maranha˜o, in a transition zone of semiarid climates northeast of the equatorial humid Amazon. Serological analysis for Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi was performed in opossums by indirect ﬂuorescent antibody test (IFAT), and all animals were serologically negative. Nine positive hemocultures (6.77%) were isolated and cryopreserved and from mammals of the Didelphimorphia and Chiroptera orders and positioned in phylogenies on the basis of sequences from different genes with reference strains of Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei and T. cruzi. From primary samples (blood and tissues) only one bat, Pteronotus parnellii, was positive to SSU rDNA and gGAPDH genes and grouped with the L. infantum chagasi branch. The studies conducted in Maranha˜o State provide knowledge of parasite diversity. It is important to determine the presence of trypanosomatids in wild mammals with synanthropic habits.",

The species is under threat from anthropogenic pressure on the little that remains of its forest habitat, now restricted to the islands’ upper elevations and steepest slopes. We report the results of the most comprehensive survey of this species to date, and present recommendations for ongoing field conservation efforts and monitoring. Morning counts were conducted at roost sites in the wet and dry seasons during –. Habitat structure around the roosting sites was characterized and roost numbers compared, to investigate the potential effect of habitat loss and degradation. We estimate the population to comprise c. , individuals distributed across  roosts on the two islands. All occupied roosting sites were restricted to a narrow altitudinal range, and roosting populations in agroforestry areas were smaller than those found in degraded and undisturbed forest. Only one of the  roosts on Anjouan was found in undisturbed, old-growth forest with no nearby signs of clearance for agriculture or landslides following tree-felling upslope. Following a suspected severe population decline as a result of widespread and long-term forest loss Livingstone’s fruit bat has been recategorized as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.",

The objective of this study was to explore the presence of Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus spp. and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis in insectivorous, frugivorous and nectarivorous bats collected in urban areas. We analysed 172 bats collected by the Epidemiological Surveillance Agency in 12 municipalities of the Midwest region of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. Spleen, liver, intestine and lung samples were subjected to microbiological culture and nested PCR analyses. Prevalence of H. capsulatum infection was 8.1% (14/172), with one bat found to be positive by fungal culturing, 12 positive by nested PCR and one positive by both methods. Two insectivorous bats were found positive by nested PCR for Cryptococcus spp., one in the spleen and the other in the spleen and lung. Two insectivorous bats showed natural infection by P. brasiliensis, in the spleen of one bat and the spleen and liver of the other. Our results reinforce the importance of bats as fungal dispersers in urban environments and the importance of constant epidemiologic surveillance because these synanthropic animals are in close contact with humans and animals.",

Assuming that (1: hypothesis of the effect of the decade) the addition of new occurrence records over time increases the potential size of the species distribution; and (2: Wallacean distance hypothesis) over the years, the new points added are increasingly distant from the research centers. Considering the geographic knowledge gap of this species, our objective is to report a new record of this species and estimate its potential distribution in South America through environment niche models (ENMs). For this, we compiled records of occurrence of species, selected from 1900 to 2015. We used 19 bioclimatic variables available in the WorldClim database to estimate the potential distribution of the species, and we used three modeling algorithms: Maximum Entropy (MXT), Random Forest (RDF), and Support Vector Machine. To test the Wallacean distance hypothesis, we calculated the Euclidian distance from occurrences to bat research centers in Brazil, located using a national researchers’ information dataset (“Plataforma Lattes”). To test the hypothesis of the decade effect, we used the beta regression analysis, taking conservative and non‐conservative approaches. The results showed that the predicted area expanded and retracted with the addition of new occurrences over the decades, with an improvement in the accuracy of models. Most records are located in the southeastern region of Brazil, but algorithms predicted areas in regions where there are no records. Only the conservative approach has had a positive relationship over the decades. The distance from new points does not increase over the years of research centers.",

We quantified bat diversity in the Parque Estadual de Terra Ronca (PETER), a Cerrado protected area. Additionally, we report an extension of the\n              Hsunycteris thomasi\n              distribution known only in the Amazon and the western portion of Brazil. Over 1.440 m\n              2\n               h of mist netting and five nights of automatic recording, we recorded five families and 38 species, while the Jackknife first-order estimator predicted the occurrence of 25 species. Besides the register of species for the area, the novelty is the increase in the potential distribution area of\n              H. thomasi\n              in Norwest’s and north of the Midwest of Brazil. We also report the presence of at least one\n              Lonchophylla dekeyseri\n              population, an endemic to Cerrado. The lack of bat captures within the cotton plantation suggests the impoverishment of the bat assemblages due to the extensive loss of native habitats.",

In both species, adult females were significantly heavier than males throughout the year. Seasonal variations were larger in adult females, body mass peaking during late pregnancy. After a secondary peak in September-October observed in both sexes in E. isabellinus, in males only in P. kuhlii, body mass reached a minimum value in winter when activity is low. Significant differences were also noticed between years in June for both species. Such pattern of seasonal variations of sexual size dimorphism is typical of hibernating vespertilionids.",

From June 2010 to June 2011 two techniques, mist-netting and echolocation call recording, were implemented. This bat species was captured throughout the year but only at water bodies and particularly at Nouh basin. Captures peaked in late spring — early summer, and declined in winter. Pregnant females were captured from April to June, and lactating females in May and June. Echolocation calls were recorded throughout the year, but not every month in all habitats. Most activity was reported at water bodies and street lamps. Activity peaked in late spring and early autumn, and declined during winter period. Terminal buzzes were mainly detected at basins, peaking in late spring — early summer and early autumn. Our study provided further insights on the importance of water bodies which should draw particular attention in the management plan of the national park and in the whole country.",

            "abstractNote": "The efficiency with which flying animals convert metabolic power to mechanical power dictates an individual's flight behaviour and energy requirements. Despite the significance of this parameter, we lack empirical data on conversion efficiency for most species as\n              in vivo\n              measurements are notoriously difficult to obtain. Furthermore, conversion efficiency is often assumed to be constant across flight speeds, even though the components driving flight power are speed-dependent. We show, through direct measurements of metabolic and aerodynamic power, that conversion efficiency in the migratory bat (\n              Pipistrellus nathusii\n              ) increases from 7.0 to 10.4% with flight speed. Our findings suggest that peak conversion efficiency in this species occurs near maximum range speed, where the cost of transport is minimized. A meta-analysis of 16 bird and 8 bat species revealed a positive scaling relationship between estimated conversion efficiency and body mass, with no discernible differences between bats and birds. This has profound consequences for modelling flight behaviour as estimates assuming 23% efficiency underestimate metabolic costs for\n              P. nathusii\n              by almost 50% on average (36–62%). Our findings suggest that conversion efficiency may vary around an ecologically relevant optimum speed and provide a crucial baseline for investigating whether this drives variation in conversion efficiency between species.",

Physical and ultrasound examinations were suggestive of an abdominal mass with free ﬂuid within the abdomen. Based on the poor and deteriorating clinical condition of the animal, euthanasia was elected. Gross necropsy revealed an irregular thickening at the root of the mesentery and a diffusely, dark-red liver with rounded hepatic margins. Histologic examination revealed extensive neoplastic effacement of the pancreas with invasion into the surrounding mesentery and mesenteric lymph nodes and metastatic spread to the liver. Based on the morphology of the neoplastic cells, the involvement of the pancreas, and immunohistochemistry, a diagnosis of metastatic pancreatic carcinoma was made. Additionally, two small neoplasms were identiﬁed in the lungs. These masses were distinct from the carcinoma, and their morphology was consistent with bronchioloalveolar adenomas. This is the ﬁrst known report of either benign pulmonary lesions or pancreatic carcinomas in the order Chiroptera.",

Carcasses of Hutton's shearwaters were collected over three field seasons, and where predation was probable, the bodies were autopsied. Paired bites identified stoats as the principal predator of Hutton's shearwater, but also revealed that a feral cat was present within the colony. Stoats killed their prey with a bite to the back of the neck or head, and commenced feeding on the neck or head. Despite the limited number of catkilled birds, cats appeared to feed on Hutton's shearwaters differently from stoats, starting on the breast muscles. Harriers and kea left sign that allowed birds killed or scavenged by these native birds to be distinguished from those killed by stoats or cats.",

            "abstractNote": "Phenology refers to the timing of events in the annual cycle of organisms. For temperate-zone mammals, hibernation is one such event, but little is known about its phenology. Hibernation consists of energy-saving torpor bouts interspersed with energetically expensive arousals to normothermic T b, and hibernators should benefit from mechanisms which reduce arousal costs and help them time arousals to coincide with foraging opportunities. In a previous study, we showed that, in contrast to hibernating bats from warmer climates, little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) from central Canada abandon a circadian pattern to arousal in the middle of winter when there is no chance of feeding. Here, we used temperature telemetry to test whether they would re-synchronize arousals with normal foraging time (i.e. sunset) during late winter as the chance of foraging or emergence opportunities improves, and whether they would synchronize arousals with conspecifics, possibly to exploit social thermoregulation. We also used passive transponders to test whether energy reserves and/or sex differences in reproductive timing influence phenology and the sensitivity of emergence timing to environmental cues. In contrast to patterns in mid-winter, after 7 April 2013, bats synchronized arousals with sunset and with conspecifics. Females emerged earlier than males, and females in the best condition emerged first while body condition had no influence on male emergence timing. Both male and female bats appeared to time emergence with falling barometric pressure, a cue that predicts favourable foraging conditions for bats but which, unlike outside temperature, would have been readily detectable by bats inside the hibernaculum. Our results highlight hibernation traits associated with extreme winter energy limitation for insect-eating bats in cold climates and illustrate the influence of reproductive timing and environmental conditions on hibernation energetics and phenology.",

We surveyed P. t. tonganus on the Cook Islands through observations, counts and interviews with local residents. We estimated the population to be c. 1,730 on Rarotonga and 78 on Mangaia. A lack of suitable habitat on Mangaia was the most important factor affecting abundance. Overhunting appears to have reduced the populations on both islands. All roost sites were found in undisturbed forest on steep slopes and ridges in the inner and most inaccessible parts of the islands, with roost preference determined by the relative safety from humans rather than food availability. The residents of the Cook Islands seem generally unaware of the serious threat the bats face, with little thought for sustainable hunting. For successful conservation it will be important to alter people’s negative perception of these mammals, promoting the value of the bats both ecologically and as a potential source of income from tourists. Habitat protection and enhancement, particularly on Mangaia, will be essential.",

However, there is surprisingly little evidence on the efficacy of gates for improving population growth rates. We used change-point models to determine the effects of gate construction on Indiana bats. We estimated population growth rates at 20 hibernacula pre- and post-gating and quantified the change in population growth rates after gate installation. Hibernacula with increasing growth rates prior to gate placement all experienced decreased growth rates after installation. For hibernacula with declining growth rates prior to construction, growth rates increased moderately after installation. When weighted by population size, average change in growth rates across all 20 hibernacula was negative. Our results suggest that use of gates at hibernacula with growing populations may relate to unintended declines in growth rates but that, at hibernacula with declining populations, installation of gates may lead to moderate increases in local population growth rates.",

We provide detailed accounts of their external and craniodental morphology, including a suite of standard measurements, and compare the new taxa with all other members of the group currently recognized in Southeast Asia. The 1st new species was previously included in M. tubinaris (Scully, 1881) but is considered distinct due to differences in external and craniodental features. This new species is widespread in continental Southeast Asia and relatively well represented in museum collections, whereas the other new species are known only from a few specimens collected at scattered localities. The new taxa are known only from forested areas, which highlights the incompleteness of existing knowledge and strong potential for further discoveries in the region.",
