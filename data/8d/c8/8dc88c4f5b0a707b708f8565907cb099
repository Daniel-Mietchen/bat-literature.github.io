Here we report the occurrence of Basilia italica, a rare nycteribiid species infesting primarily forest-dwelling bats. This is the first country-record for Romania and also represents the easternmost occurrence of this species. Further studies are needed to evaluate the vectorial potential of B. italica.",

Only known from one small area within the National Park,\n              R. hilli\n              is listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), based on its extremely small geographic range and presumed low number of mature individuals. Here, we present and describe bat species occurrence data contributed to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) that we collected as part of a long-term collaborative project to rediscover this lost species. This data paper describes the survey methods and findings resulting from cave roost surveys, capture surveys, and acoustic sampling of bat echolocation activity in Nyungwe National Park and surrounding areas in south-western Rwanda from 2013-2020 and their conservation relevance.\n            \n            \n              We report the discovery of an extant population of Hill's horseshoe bat (\n              Rhinolophus hilli\n              ) in Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda, 40 years since the last reported observation of the species in 1981. We also report the first record of Lander's horseshoe bat (\n              Rhinolophus landeri\n              ) in Nyungwe National Park and the first record of the Damara woolly bat (\n              Kerivoula argentata\n              ) in Rwanda. The dataset contributed to GBIF and described in this paper includes 278 occurrence records from 10 bat species of five families detected at 71 locations in or near Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda. We include a description of the morphological descriptions of\n              R. hilli\n              and present the first acoustic echolocation signatures and phylogenetic information for this species.",

            "abstractNote": "The technical limitations of capillary sequencing in providing insights on phylogeny have been greatly aided in recent years by the implementation of next generation sequencing platforms which can generate whole mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences. In this study, enriched mitochondrial DNA of\n              Cynopterus brachyotis\n              from Mindanao, Philippines was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of 653,967 clean paired-end reads was assembled using a MIRA-MITObim pipeline, resulting in a consensus mitogenome sequence length of 17,382 bases and a GC content of 41.48%, which is consistent with other published mitogenomes in fruit bats. The assembled\n              C. brachyotis\n              mitogenome was annotated using the MITOS online server and was able to resolve all mitochondrial genes, except for one transfer RNA gene (trnT) which may be further resolved by additional capillary sequencing of the region. Sequence analysis showed that the Philippine\n              C. brachyotis\n              is only 90%-91% homologous with other\n              Cynopterus\n              spp., based on its full mitogenome sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of fruit bat mitogenomes, deposited in online repositories, revealed that the Philippine\n              C. brachyotis\n              in this study has diverged from Asian\n              Cynopterus\n              , namely\n              Cynopterus brachyotis\n              and\n              Cynopterus sphinx\n              from other parts of Asia (100% bootstrap support) with the latter two forming a separate clade. This divergence at the species level was consistent with phylogentic inference using cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) and cytochrome B (cytb) gene markers. Our results strengthen the previously reported hypothesis that the Cynopterus cf. brachyotis in the Philippines is distinct from its Asian counterparts and should be, therefore, treated as a new species.",

This bat is a new record for the national park and the second record for Sabah. It was first recorded from Banggi Island, Kudat, in 1991. The species' few records throughout its range is most likely due to sampling effort bias towards forest interior and cave-dwelling species, as this species is more likely an edge-space aerial forager. It is morphologically similar to Peninsular Malaysia's Hypsugo macrotis, but the latter has never been reported from Borneo. Therefore, additional specimen collection and molecular data for H. cf. vordermanni are needed for further species confirmation. More information on H. vordermanni ecology is also crucial in aiding the management plan for this species as it is currently classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN.",

            "abstractNote": "Bulgaria has a very rich bat fauna and large colonies of bats can be found in caves, mines and other underground roosts. Respectively, there are more than 107 underground roosts that are listed as important bat sites, most of which are protected by statutory laws and are of national or international importance. Despite the existence of formal protection, many roosts face anthropogenic disturbances due to the popularity of outdoor activities, such as caving and the lack of actual regulation. Currently, the evaluation was only based on the size of the colony and the presence of protected species. However, this approach is limited to roosts that contain high diversity and neglects the ones that contain high biotic importance that are highly threatened by various threats. Here, we evaluated conservation priorities and identified the most vulnerable underground bat roosts in Bulgaria, using the Bat Cave Vulnerability Index and proposed measures to adequately protect sites. We found that 32% of the Bulgarian bat roosts assessed are at a \"high priority\" level for conservation and protection, while 39% are at a \"medium priority\" that may require constant monitoring. This novel and integrative approach applied to bat roost prioritisation in the country enabled the detection of sites that need urgent conservation attention and is the first step in establishing better strategies for the bat monitoring network in Bulgaria.",

The major groups are afrotheres (\n              e.g\n              ., aardvarks, elephants), xenarthrans (\n              e.g\n              ., anteaters, sloths), laurasiatheres (\n              e.g\n              ., horses, shrews), and euarchontoglires (\n              e.g\n              ., humans, rodents). Compared with previous hypotheses this tree is remarkably stable; however, some uncertainty persists about the location of the placental root, and (for example) the position of bats within laurasiatheres, of sea cows and aardvarks within afrotheres, and of dermopterans within euarchontoglires. A variety of names for sub‐clades within the new placental mammal tree have been proposed, not all of which follow conventions regarding priority and stability. More importantly, the new phylogenetic framework enables the formulation of new hypotheses and testing thereof, for example regarding the possible developmental dichotomy that seems to distinguish members of the newly identified southern and northern radiations of living placental mammals.",

Observations indicate that the origin of the gaseous ammonia is rapid microbial decomposition of bat urea, not chitinous guano. Modelling of ammonia distribution and diffusion indicates that ammonia production at the Cueva del Tigre is ~257 g NH3/day, equivalent to the decomposition of ~454 g urea/day. Ammonia production is also characterized by significant isotopic fractionation favoring isotopically light (5 15N depleted) ammonia.",

We present a simplified dynamical model with body translational and rotational degrees of freedom that incorporates the flapping, long-axis wing rotation and folding of the wing. To validate our simulation, we compare our results with direct measurements from hovering insects, hummingbirds and bats. Results show that long-axis wing rotation angle (a proxy for pronation) has a significant effect on energy efficiency. For a given wing rotation amplitude, the hovering system has a poweroptimal flapping frequency for each stroke-plane orientation, and that frequency closely corresponds to the wingbeat frequencies observed in a diverse range of hummingbird species. We find that larger animals (with larger total mass and wing size), such as bats, require more power to maintain a stable hovering orbit and that hovering with a constant wingspan becomes increasingly impractical with increasing body size. We show, as an exemplar, that for a system of the size of a hovering bat, e.g. Glossophaga soricina, hovering with constant wingspan is dynamically possible, but is implausible and inefficient. For these conditions, hovering with varying wingspan, retracting the wing on the upstroke, is a more realistic hovering modality.",

The faecal pellets of these bat species were collected in the ﬁeld and later analysed under a dissecting microscope. The three species studied are known to be very similar as far as their ecology, echolocation and preferred habitats are concerned, but they diverge signiﬁcantly in their body sizes. In this study, all three species fed predominantly on moths [59–80 percentage frequency (%f); 87–95 percentage volume (%vol)], but their diet compositions diﬀered in the size of individuals consumed. The smallest bat species (R. hipposideros) fed only on the smallest moths (%f = 59; %vol = 87), the medium-sized species (R. euryale) mainly on medium-sized moths (%f = 60; %vol = 74) and the largest one (R. ferrumequinum) especially on the largest moths (%f = 54; %vol = 89). Despite similar preferred habitat and the main prey category, the rates of trophic niche overlap were surprisingly low. The trophic niche percentage overlap was 7–31% (computed from %f data) and 1–20% (computed from %vol data), respectively and suggests an extraordinary importance of mere divergences of bats in their body sizes for trophic niche partitioning and stable species coexistence.",

However, an increase in some bat populations has been recently found in some parts of western Europe. We monitored wintering bats in the underground caves of north-western Italy (Piedmont, Valle d’Aosta and Liguria regions), with the aim of estimating long-term population variations. Over 28 years (from 1992 to 2019), 52 hibernation sites were monitored where 14 species of bats were present. Altogether, 97% of individuals belonged to Rhinolophus euryale, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus hipposideros, Barbastella barbastellus, Myotis emarginatus, and to the large Myotis group (Myotis myotis/blythii). We found a positive population trend for these six most common species with an average annual increase ranging between 3.5% (R. ferrumequinum) and 15.0% (B. barbastellus), which is in congruence with what has occurred in central and western Europe in the last 20 years. The species R. hipposideros showed a significant increase during the first 10 years, followed by a stable trend thereafter.",

This paper presents a new approach to analyse the relationship between morphological features and acoustical properties of the external ear of bat species. The beam pattern of Rousettus leschenaultiiʼs right ear is measured and compared to that of receiver structures whose design is inspired by the bat ear itself and made of appropriate geometric shapes. The regular shape of these receivers makes it possible to control the key reception parameters and thus to understand the effect on the associated beam pattern of the parameters themselves. Measurements show one receiver structure has a beam pattern very similar to that of R. leschenaultiiʼs ear, thus explaining the function of individual parts constituting its ear. As it is applicable to all bat species, this approach can provide a useful tool to investigate acoustics in bats, and possibly other mammals.",

The levels of organochlorine residues and of cadmium were also higher in the population living close to the industrial area. The proximate cause of the decline, however, is assumed to be deteriorating feeding conditions due to drainage and water pollution.",

            "abstractNote": "High number of moth species are considered to be agricultural pests in their caterpillar stage. Birds and other arthropods often forage moths, but ecosystem services provided by temperate bats are just coming to light in past few years. Although there is no doubt that insectivorous bats forage upon adult stages of pest moths contributing to the quality and quantity of crops, it remains unclear how many prey items have foraged and therefore it is unclear if the amounts taken are sufficient for biocontrol. Molecular detection of pest moth imagoes in bat diet is a relatively new approach that only delivers present or absent data. Therefore, sorting contains of bat faeces using morphological size determination may lead to better prey quantification. As the number of consumed prey items determines the boundary between consumption and regulatory significance, we focused on (i) if indigestible moth body parts retrieved from faeces reflect the number of moths eaten, (ii) how size of indigestible moth body parts relates to the overall moth body size, and (iii) an accuracy of moth classification into size groups. Our results indicated that base frenulum (hook holding front and hinder wings together) width is the most suitable characteristic to determine body size of the moth, with a discrimination success exceeding 73% when placing the moth into one of four size categories. The size differentiation of prey within a faecal sample together with molecular identification and other semiquantitative methods allows for more precise quantification and could yet help confirm the importance of bats as biological control agents.",

Since European settlement in 1788, 71 species of native mammals have been recorded in the Division, seven more have been documented only as sub­ fossils, and a further 15 species occur within 100 km of the Divisional boundary. At least 27 of the original species have become regionally extinct, and a further 11 have de­ clined in distribution. As in other regions of Australia, species losses have been greatest for rodents and marsupi­ als in a critical weight range of 35-5500 g, and least for bats. However, percentage losses among the terrestrial fauna are high relative to other regions, and probab(v reflect both the early settlement of New South Wales and the marginal distribution in the Division of 49% of the original fauna. Feral cats are implicated in the regional extinction of up to ten species of native mammals prior to 1857. Sub­ sequent extinctions and range reductions are attributed to combinations of causes, including predation from cats Felis catus and red foxes Vulpes vulpes, competition and habitat degradation from rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, stock and other introduced herbivores, clearing of trees, changes infire regimes and human persecution.",

We used long-term (up to 19-year) studies of four animal groups in central Amazonia to test whether species' abundances in the matrix were correlated with their relative extinction proneness in forest fragments. The four groups, birds, frogs, small mammals, and ants, had varying overall responses to fragmentation: species richness of small mammals and frogs increased after fragment isolation, whereas that of birds and ants decreased. For all four groups, a high proportion of nominally primary-forest species were detected in matrix habitats, with 8±25% of species in each group found exclusively in the matrix. The three vertebrate groups (birds, small mammals, frogs) exhibited positive and signi®cant correlations between matrix abundance and vulnerability to fragmentation, suggesting that species that avoid the matrix tend to decline or disappear in fragments, while those that tolerate or exploit the matrix often remain stable or increase. These results highlight the importance of the matrix in the dynamics and composition of vertebrate communities in tropical forest remnants, and have important implications for the management of fragmented landscapes. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The focus was on the logged-unloggedforest mosaic rather than on individual logged or unlogged patches. This approach, which compared large areas of unlogged forest with large areas offorest occurring within a loggedunlogged mosaic, was expected to provide more biologically meaningfiil results, particularly for species with large home ranges. Sampling sites were stratified by geology, within a specljied range of mean annual rainfall, and by logging history. Analyses also considered the role of elevation, predominant vegetation community and the proportion of the surrounding landscape which had been logged. All species, with the exception of the greater glider Petauroides volans, were recorded as frequently or more frequently in forests growing on Ordovician sediments.",

We captured 3835 bats representing 39 species: 76% were captured in continuous forest, 74% in the mosaic habitat and 87% in forest fragments. In the mosaic habitat we captured 43% of the total number of bats, 33% in the forest fragments and 24% in continuous forest. On average the habitats studied had 64% species in common. Evidence of continuous breeding activity was determined for a high number of species at the three habitats (> 70% lactating and 65% with embryos). A few bat species (Carollia brevicauda, Pteronotus parnelli, Sturnira lilium, Artibeus jamaicensis, Dermanura phaeotis, Vampyrodes caraccioli, Glossophaga soricina, Dermanuta toltecus, Cheoroniscus godmani, Platyrrhinus helleri) dominated the sample, but their relative dominance varied among habitats. Recapture of bats provided evidence for inter-habitat movement. The cooccurrence of the three habitats helps conserve a diverse assemblage of bat species in the local landscape. # 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

With an estimated population of less than 2000 individuals, P. livingstonii is listed as Critically Endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red List. Yet the habitat characteristics of these giant fruit bats, or ﬂying foxes, are poorly known. I conducted ﬁeld research during 5 months in 1998 focused on ﬁnding new roost sites, measuring characteristics of both roost sites and roost trees at new as well as previously identiﬁed roost sites, and recording the same characteristics for a set of absence sites. I identiﬁed six new roost sites allowing me to measure the characteristics of 15 known roost sites and seven absence sites. The study spanned both dry and rainy seasons and I found a signiﬁcant increase in the number of individuals at roost sites during the rainy season. Bat roost sites were associated with presence of water, southeast aspect, steep slopes, and presence of several native tree species. Roost habitat was characterized based on biotic, abiotic and human factors. This research on habitat characteristics is contributing to the development of a conservation action plan for the Livingstone’s fruit bats. However, further research on dry season roost sites and distribution as well as feeding sites is necessary in order to better understand their seasonal habitat requirements and therefore ensure the conservation of P. livingstonii. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Resource partitioning of roosts and food is considered a key element in shaping bat communities. In this paper we examine the roosting patterns of 10 bat species belonging to a neotropical bat community in a Bolivian savanna. Roosts were more common in open woodlands than in forest islands and human settlements. In open woodlands, Tabebuia heptaphylla comprised the largest proportion of roosting trees, whereas in forest islands, Gallesia integrifolia was the most important roosting tree for phyllostomid bats. By comparing active roosts with control holes in Tabebuia heptaphylla, we found that roost site selection by Noctilio albiventris was mainly based on tree diameter and inner width of the cavities. The earlier results are discussed in view of resource partitioning within savanna bat communities and their practical conservation.",

            "abstractNote": "Understanding the processes that underlie bat distribution and activity patterns requires examination of habitat associations at multiple scales. We examined the association of both local structure and landscape context with bat activity in forested stands using ultrasonic detectors. Forty-eight stands in western Oregon and Washington were monitored for bat activity on at least six occasions for each of two ﬁeld seasons. At the stand level, bat activity was negatively associated with tree density. The standard deviation of tree density and the density of newly created snags were positively associated with bat activity. In combination, these three variables explained 46% of the total variance in bat activity among stands. Landscape-level variables did not explain any signiﬁcant variation among a subset of stands (n=22). Our study suggests that management of forest-dwelling bats should focus primarily on structural attributes at the stand level and the eﬀects of these features on feeding and roosting opportunities. # 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Data were collected in two periods, January–March and April–May 2001, from 32 underground sites, 25 of which had not been surveyed previously. Approximately 76,000 bats representing 13 species were recorded. The most abundant species were Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus euryale, Myotis myotis/blythii, Myotis capaccinii, and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. The roosts were evaluated for their conservation importance. The most important sites in Turkish Thrace are Dupnisa and Koyunbaba. The Dupnisa Cave serves as a hibernaculum to approximately 28,000 bats representing ﬁve species. The Koyunbaba Cave is a nursery roost to approximately 23,000 bats of six species. Presently, none of the caves in the region has adequate protection and some bat populations are under serious threat.",

The beneﬁts provided by a new woodland not only depend on the design of the woodland (local site level), but also on its location in the wider landscape. This paper develops a generic GIS-based method to map the potential biodiversity beneﬁts of new woodlands through an integration of species-habitat modelling for a list of 15 key species derived from a ‘‘Local Biodiversity Action Plan’’, encompassing the Northeast of Scotland, and spatial multi-criteria analysis. For each selected species ÔPreferred Future WoodlandÕ maps are produced, indicating the extent to which populations of these species are expected to expand or contract in response to further aﬀorestation. Species are then weighted on the basis of criteria of relative scarcity of suitable habitat and national importance of the regional population. The maps are then combined using this weighting to yield an overall potential biodiversity beneﬁt map, which shows that the areas with the highest potential biodiversity gains are the edges of major agricultural areas (mostly deciduous), the riparian zones (deciduous) and areas adjacent to mature native pine woods (coniferous). It is demonstrated that the use of this map for more explicit spatial targeting of an existing farm aﬀorestation scheme can help to provide much more Ôbiodiversity valueÕ for taxpayersÕ money.",

            "abstractNote": "We actively sampled the bat community at 63 sites using detection and non-detection metrics on the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF) in the central Appalachians of West Virginia using Anabat acoustical equipment May–June 2001–2003 to relate species presence to simple habitat measures such as proximity to riparian areas, forest canopy cover, forest canopy gap width, and forest canopy height. We acoustically detected eight species on the FEF, including the endangered Myotis sodalis. The presence of Lasiurus cinereus, M. lucifugus, M. sodalis, and Pipistrellus subﬂavus was associated more with riparian areas than upland areas. Both univariate comparisons and multiple logistic regression modeling showed that the probability that clutter-adapted foraging species such as M. septentrionalis and M. sodalis would be detected was greater as forest canopy cover increased or forest canopy gap size decreased, whereas the opposite was true for open-adapted foraging species such as Eptesicus fuscus and L. cinereus. The overall proportion of unidentiﬁable bat echolocation sequences to those identiﬁed to species was related to upland sites with increasing forest canopy cover indicating some sampling bias between cluttered and uncluttered habitats. However, given suﬃcient sample points, bat community surveys using acoustical detection show the ability to quickly develop generalized habitat associations for rugged areas such as the central Appalachians where traditional mist-net survey eﬀorts often are logistically diﬃcult and are lacking in scope. Moreover, these acoustical surveys also could lend themselves to species-speciﬁc predictive mapping of foraging habitat as well as allowing researchers to formulate testable hypotheses about detailed bat habitat relationships to be deﬁnitively tested with radio-telemetry techniques.",

Can species that are morphologically almost identical occupy different ecological niches, and hence potentially need distinct conservation planning? The discovery that the most widespread bat in Europe – the pipistrelle – comprised two cryptic species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus) that emit echolocation calls at different frequencies provides a remarkable model system for investigating links between morphology, echolocation call design and resource partitioning. We investigated resource partitioning between the two cryptic species of sympatric pipistrelle bats by radio tracking breeding females. Habitat selection was investigated by using compositional analysis. P. pygmaeus selected riparian habitats over all other habitat types in its core foraging areas, whereas P. pipistrellus, although preferring deciduous woodland overall, was more of a generalist, spreading its foraging time in a wider range of habitats. Although morphologically very similar, the cryptic species show quite different patterns of habitat use. Our ﬁndings suggest that large-scale differences in habitat preferences can occur between sympatric bat species that are virtually identical in ﬂight morphology; hence morphological differences may be a weak indication of ecological differences between taxa. Conservation planning needs to take account of these differences to meet policy and legal obligations associated with these protected cryptic species.",

This study evaluates the statistical strength and usefulness for conservation purposes of a predictive habitat use model developed for Chalinolobus tuberculatus, a threatened microchiropteran bat species found in the temperate rainforests of New Zealand. The relationship between various environmental variables and the presence/absence of the species was investigated using generalised linear modelling. The model developed was coupled with GIS data to develop maps of predicted occurrence within the West Coast region of New Zealand’s South Island. It was found that distance to forest boundary, slope, presence of Nothofagus, general land cover, variability in mean annual solar radiation, and mean ambient winter minimum temperature were signiﬁcantly associated with the occurrence of the species. Evaluation of the statistical strength of the distribution model with independent data of species’ occurrence collected at 152 sites found that the C. tuberculatus model showed a moderate ability to predict both species presence and absence (s(b) coefﬁcient = 0.37). The ﬁeld detection rate (0.45) using this model was signiﬁcantly higher than that of historical surveys (0.12). The value of the species habitat model and the need to evaluate its utility in the development of conservation strategies is discussed.",

A bat-box program designed to ascertain bat-box preferences was initiated in 1999 in the Ebro Delta (NE Spain), one of the most important wetlands in Europe. A total of 69 batboxes of two types (single and double compartment) were placed on three supports (trees, houses, and posts) facing east or west. Pipistrellus pygmaeus occupancy rates and the number of individuals per box were monitored on 16 occasions from July 2000 to February 2004. Bat-box preferences were only detected during the breeding season. Bat abundance was higher in east-facing boxes, in double-compartment boxes, and in boxes placed on posts and houses. Boxes on natural supports (trees) were avoided. Bat-box occupancy rates were higher during the breeding season (95.6%, spring–summer) due to the formation of maternity colonies. The number of individuals in bat-boxes during the breeding season increased as the study period progressed (from summer 2000 to summer 2003), suggesting a high degree of acceptance by maternity colonies of these alternative locations. Occupancy rates observed were the highest ever reported in bat-box scientiﬁc literature. This study highlights the role of bat-box programs as useful alternative management tools for the conservation of bat populations in highly productive wetland habitats where few natural roost sites are available.",

            "abstractNote": "Worldwide, there are more than 1100 species of the Order Chiroptera, 45 of which are present in Europe, and 16 in the UK. Bats are reservoirs of, or can be infected by, several viral diseases, including rabies virus strains (in the Lyssavirus genus). Within this genus are bat variants that have been recorded in Europe; European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1), European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2) and, four currently unclassiﬁed isolates. Since 1977, 783 cases of EBLVs (by isolation of viral RNA) have been recorded in Europe. EBLV-1 or EBLV-2 has been identiﬁed in 12 bat species, with over 95% of EBLV-1 infections identiﬁed in Eptesicus serotinus. EBLV-2 is associated with Myotis species (Myotis daubentonii and Myotis dasycneme). A programme of passive surveillance in the United Kingdom between 1987 and 2004 tested 4871 bats for lyssaviruses. Of these, four M. daubentonii (3.57% of submitted M. daubentonii) were positive for EBLV-2. Potential bias in the passive surveillance includes possible overrepresentation of synanthropic species and regional biases caused by varying bat submission numbers from different parts of the UK. In 2003, active surveillance in the UK began, and has detected an antibody prevalence level of 1–5% of EBLV-2 in M. daubentonii (n = 350), and one bat with antibodies to EBLV-1 in E. serotinus (n = 52). No cases of live lyssavirus infection or lyssavirus viral RNA have been detected through active surveillance. Further research and monitoring regarding prevalence, transmission, pathogenesis and immunity is required to ensure that integrated bat conservation continues throughout Europe, whilst enabling informed policy decision regarding both human and wildlife health issues.",

This region (referred to as the Biafran forests and highlands) is a center of endemism for a wide variety of taxa including, but not limited to, primates, anuran amphibians, birds, freshwater ﬁsh, butterﬂies, dragonﬂies, and trees. Though these groups have diverse distributions, conservation efforts have to date largely been focused on lowland areas. We conducted a GISbased analysis of point locality records for three groups characterized by high endemism (primates, anuran amphibians, birds) in order to examine both their spatial and altitudinal distribution throughout the study area. We also evaluated the distribution of existing and potential protected areas relative to highland areas and the distribution of endemics. Our analysis suggests that the existing protected area system provides poor coverage of montane habitats and their associated endemic taxa. Complementarity analysis suggests that, if the protected area network were expanded to include a small number of highland sites, coverage of endemic taxa could be signiﬁcantly improved. Many of these important highland sites are currently under intense pressure from habitat loss and hunting. If the full range of biodiversity present in the Biafran forests and highlands is to be preserved, new protected areas should be gazetted that take the varied distributions of the regions endemic taxa into account.",

However, information on bat use exists for only a small fraction of caves in many parts of the temperate world, in part because current survey methods are inappropriate for many species. We surveyed the UK’s largest karst landscape, the Yorkshire Dales, by monitoring autumn swarming (mating) activity at 53 caves using automated echolocation call loggers, followed by trapping. Over 60% of caves surveyed were used by bats, but there was considerable variation in activity. Swarming activity was positively correlated with chamber development and negatively correlated with the amount of water the cave carried: together these two predictors explained 45% of the variance. Entrance orientation and shelter explained a further 10%. Activity was not correlated with entrance size, altitude or connectivity to the nearest summer habitat. All ﬁve resident swarming species were caught at most sites: Myotis brandtii, Myotis daubentonii, Myotis mystacinus, Myotis nattereri and Plecotus auritus. Behaviour, species composition and sex and age ratios were typical of swarming reported in other studies. Bat populations and catchment sizes were large and despite the proximity of other suitable caves, bats showed high ﬁdelity to single sites. Our results show that the national importance of these caves has been overlooked. We suggest that survey for swarming activity is a quick and effective method of identifying underground bat sites and is likely to uncover many previously unknown and important sites throughout the temperate world.",

Bat activity was measured using broadband acoustic detectors and macroinvertebrates by three 30-s standard benthic kick samples per site. Biological indices of water quality were signiﬁcantly lower downstream from sewage outfalls, relative to upstream. The soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus) was signiﬁcantly more active (as measured by bat passes per unit time) at downstream sites, while Daubenton’s bat (Myotis daubentonii) was less active. These results contrast with those of a similar study in England, where P. pygmaeus were less active, and Myotis spp. were more active downstream from sewage outfalls. We suggest that P. pygmaeus were more active downstream in our study because of a preference for preying on small orthocladiinid Chironomidae (non-biting midges), which were signiﬁcantly more abundant downstream. M. daubentonii may prefer Trichoptera (caddis ﬂy), which were signiﬁcantly more abundant upstream. Organic pollution may then affect bats, but its effect appears to be more complex than previously implied. Implications of changing nutrient levels in freshwaters for populations of M. daubentonii and P. pygmaeus may be different from what is currently suggested in the literature.",

We tested the hypothesis that river restoration (re-meandering) conducted in the Shibetsu River, northern Japan, enhances foraging habitat quality by increasing the abundance of aquatic insects. From June to September 2004, ﬂying insects were collected using Malaise traps in restored and channelised reaches in the Shibetsu River. Bat activity was recorded by bat detectors placed near the Malaise traps in each of the two reaches. Foraging activity of Daubenton’s bat was more strongly related to the number of insects than to biomass, and to adult aquatic insects than to terrestrial insects. The high dependence of Daubenton’s bat on aquatic prey was attributed to the fact that aquatic insect numbers were always higher than those of terrestrial insects. Contrary to the hypothesis, Daubenton’s bat was more active in the channelised reach than the restored reach in all months except June, and it synchronized its foraging activity with the seasonal distribution of adult aquatic insects. However, the study was undertaken just two years after restoration and the riparian vegetation had not yet established itself. Our results demonstrate the importance of aquatic insect abundance for Daubenton’s bat throughout the seasons in large lowland rivers. A further decrease in aquatic insects, associated with progressive anthropogenic alteration of river environments, undoubtedly exerts a harmful inﬂuence on the conservation of this species.",

Conservation actions for small species are relatively inexpensive compared to the interventions required to protect charismatic, large mammals. However, threatened small mammals such as rodents, bats, shrews and small marsupials attract less research attention, conservation actions, space in zoos, and funding than larger species, and most threatened small mammals receive no attention, particularly those in tropical forest habitats. I investigated how the body size of rediscovered mammals has changed during the last century, how body size is associated with search and conservation effort and subsequent recovery, and the success of recovery actions for rediscovered mammals. There has been a strong decline in the mean body size of rediscovered mammals since the 19th century. Smaller species were missing for longer before rediscovery, and attracted less search effort. Cost estimates were lower in recovery plans for smaller rediscovered mammals. Despite this, increasing population trend after rediscovery was associated with larger body size, and larger species recovered better with conservation effort, although small species declined despite conservation effort. All species with no conservation actions (the majority of small species) were declining. Sixty percent of rediscovered mammals remain critically endangered or endangered, and 8% (6 species) are likely to be extinct. I argue that conservation outcomes for rediscovered mammals could be greatly improved by a modest increase in attention to small-bodied species.",

            "abstractNote": "Agricultural intensiﬁcation is a major cause of biodiversity declines. Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced in many countries as an attempt to counteract the negative effects of intensive agriculture by providing ﬁnancial incentives for farmers to adopt environmentally-sensitive agricultural practices. We surveyed 18 pairs of AES and conventionally-managed farms in central Scotland (United Kingdom) to evaluate the effects of speciﬁc AES management prescriptions (ﬁeld margins, hedgerows, species-rich grasslands and water margins) on foraging bats and nocturnal insects. In addition, we assessed the importance of habitat in the wider landscape at several spatial scales on foraging bats and their insect prey. Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus were the most commonly recorded species, accounting for 98% of total bat activity levels. Overall levels of bat activity and the abundance of their insect prey (mainly Diptera and Trichoptera) were lower (by 40–50%) on farms participating in AES than on non-participating farms. Differences in insect abundance were also signiﬁcant when we compared speciﬁc AES management prescriptions with equivalent conventionally-managed features. The surrounding landscape inﬂuenced bat activity; fragmentation metrics related to woodland conﬁguration were the most important landscape characteristics inﬂuencing bat activity levels. However, the two Pipistrelle species responded differently to the surrounding landscape, P. pipistrellus being strongly inﬂuenced by the landscape at large scales (e.g. within 2 km of the monitoring site) and P. pygmaeus being most inﬂuenced by the landscape at smaller scales (within 500 m of the monitoring site). Insect abundance was positively affected by the percentage cover of semi-natural environment within 500 m of trapping sites. We suggest that the implementation of the four common AES management prescriptions assessed in this study does not beneﬁt Pipistrelle bats nor other bat species foraging on similar prey. Such species may respond more positively to a landscape-scale management approach focused mainly on the creation and management of woodland.",

            "abstractNote": "Conserving biodiversity in agricultural landscapes is an urgent issue. The effective conservation of biodiversity requires plans based on species’ habitat preferences at multiple spatial scales. We examined how the foraging habitat selection of bats varied with grain size (50, 150, 250, and 350 m) and how habitat selection in the home range differed from that in the foraging habitat in an agricultural landscape. Focusing on three sympatric Myotis species (Myotis petax, Myotis gracilis, and Myotis frater), we radio-tracked 10 individuals of each species for 121 nights in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Rivers and broadleaved riparian forests were commonly preferred at multiple scales, although the preferred land-cover type was dependent on both extent and grain size for most species. The best grain sizes for predicting the foraging-habitat use of M. petax and M. gracilis were 50 and 150 m. By contrast, M. frater showed no tendency across the grain sizes. Our results indicate that it is necessary to consider both extent and grain size to understand the habitat selection of bats. Our ﬁndings also suggest that focusing primarily on preferred land-cover types at multiple scales is effective for conservation planning, given the limited resources in terms of time, manpower, and ﬁnances. Although arable did not negatively affect the selection of foraging habitats and home ranges in these bat species, preventing the loss of rivers and forests should be prioritized over preventing arable land expansion.",

            "abstractNote": "Conservation efforts for endangered animals commonly focus on the protection of foraging habitats, aiming to ensure sufﬁcient food availability. However, the diet of many species is based on animals that undergo habitat shifts across ontogenetic life stages, yielding considerable differences between the lifelong habitat requirements of both predator and prey. Consequently, prey availability may not only depend on the suitability of the foraging grounds where predator and prey coincide, but also on habitats where the ecological requirements of the nonprey stages are fulﬁlled. In this study we test to what extent prey of the insectivorous bat Rhinolophus euryale (Blasius 1853) originate either from the grounds where they are consumed, or in areas/habitats outside the bat's foraging sites. We analyzed the diet of R. euryale, by identifying its prey to the species level using DNA metabarcoding, and by searching for its prey's larval feeding requirements in the literature. We found that the larvae of the moth prey grow both inside and outside the grounds where they are hunted by the bats once the moths reach their adult stage. The importance of prey that originated from outside the bat's foraging grounds varied considerably across seasons. As a result, R. euryale does not only rely on the landscape elements where it hunts, but also on other source areas/habitats that supply it with food. This study shows that conservation measures that aim to address the foraging requirements of predatory species should not be limited to merely protecting their foraging grounds, but should also take into account the ecological requirements of their prey throughout their life stages.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats play an important role in ecosystems and are highly relevant as indicators of environmental change. Long-term monitoring of bat populations is therefore fundamental to verifying environmental change over time. Although in the past, signiﬁcant declines in bat populations have been reported across Europe, only limited data are available from systematic monitoring schemes over long periods. In this study we use data from the National Bat Monitoring Programme, a citizen science scheme drawing on over 3500 volunteers, to estimate changes in populations across Great Britain for 10 bat species or species groups between 1997 and 2012. We demonstrate uniquely how data collected on relative abundance and activity of bats by volunteers at 3272 sites using standardised, multiple survey methods (counts at roosts and bat detector surveys using tuneable, heterodyne detectors) can be successfully utilised to produce statistically robust population indices for a large proportion of a country’s bat fauna. All trends calculated, with the exception of one species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), had sufﬁcient power to detect Red Alert level declines. Our results reveal a generally favourable picture for bats over the monitoring period; all species showed a stable or increasing trend from at least one survey type, although for four species where there were multiple trends from different survey types, the trend directions did not agree (Myotis nattereri, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Eptesicus serotinus). This study demonstrates that use of volunteer programmes can be successful in monitoring bat populations, provided that key features including standardised survey methods and volunteer training are incorporated. Some species that are more difﬁcult to detect and identify may however require specialist surveillance techniques.",

            "abstractNote": "Habitat suitability models (HSMs) have so far been used mainly to study broad-scale patterns of species distribution based on environmental variables; however, they can also be applied to address conservation needs at ﬁner scales. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of using HSMs based on presence-only data to predict bat foraging habitat suitability around maternity roosts using radio-tracking location data. We radio-marked 34 Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and 29 Myotis emarginatus from two mixed-species maternity roosts (21.5 km apart) in a Mediterranean landscape. We generated foraging habitat suitability maps for the two species and the two colonies incorporating 17 land cover variables as well as distance from the maternity roosts. We then compared the performance of four presence-only models: Mahalanobis distance, ENFA, MADIFA and MaxEnt. Our study found that all four models generated foraging habitat suitability maps that performed well at predicting the species-speciﬁc quality of foraging habitat based on the conﬁguration of the landscape. Riparian vegetation, woodland and distance from roosts play a key role in foraging habitat selection around colonies both for R. ferrumequinum and M. emarginatus. MaxEnt was the model that best predicted suitable foraging habitats. These are also the best models at predicting foraging habitat suitability with relatively good performance around another colony maternity roost using independent radio-tracking locations. Because many bat species are threatened by foraging habitat loss, habitat suitability modeling offers a useful tool in deﬁning appropriate conservation guidelines that protect foraging habitats around bat maternity roosts.",

Unfortunately, the information on the relative impact of these two components of landscape structure on biological assemblages is scarce, but urgently needed to improve conservation strategies. We assessed the relative inﬂuence of the composition (landscape forest cover and matrix composition) and conﬁguration (degree of forest fragmentation and forest edge density) of 100-ha and 500-ha landscapes on the abundance, diversity, and evenness of phyllostomid bat assemblages in the Lacandona rainforest, Mexico. We assessed the complete bat assemblage and frugivorous bats separately, and we grouped frugivores into understory foragers and canopy foragers. Landscape forest cover was the main predictor of the complete bat assemblage, positively affecting species diversity, particularly the number of rare species. Thus, community evenness decreased in landscapes with higher forest cover. Although weaker, species diversity was positively related to fragmentation and negatively associated with edge density. Landscape composition also was relatively more important than conﬁguration for frugivores. The number of common and dominant frugivorous species and the abundance of understory frugivores increased in landscapes with lower forest cover and dominated by secondary forests in the matrix. The abundance of canopy frugivores showed the opposite response. Thus, to preserve bat assemblages and their important functional roles, conservation initiatives should prioritize a reduction in deforestation and the increase of secondary forests in the matrix. Maintaining all remaining forest patches is needed to favor landscape complementation and supplementation dynamics.",

            "abstractNote": "The conversion of natural lands to agriculture is a leading cause of the worldwide loss of biodiversity. In particular, cropland monocultures alter insect abundance and diversity compared to adjacent natural habitats. While agricultural lands can provide large numbers of insect pests as prey items to predators such as bats, insect pest population size vary greatly throughout growing seasons. This study assesses the importance of land use and corn earworm moth availability as spatial and temporal drivers of bat activity. We quantiﬁed spatial variation in land use patterns at ﬁfteen sites located within the Winter Garden region in south central Texas and used bat detectors and insect pheromone traps to monitor nightly bat activity and corn earworm moth abundance across the landscape and throughout most of the year. Our temporal analyses show that bat activity was positively correlated with moth abundance, but only early in the growing season when moth abundance is at its peak. The key result from this study is a positive relationship between bat activity and natural habitat cover during late summer months, corresponding to periods of low moth abundance and a peak in bat activity. During the late summer period, bats were more active at sites containing a larger percentage of natural habitats than those containing a larger percentage of agricultural land. Our results strongly suggest that intensive agricultural practices create systems providing bats with inconsistent resource supply, but the persistence of natural habitats provides consistency in food supply though time. Taken together, these ﬁndings illustrate the importance of protecting and restoring natural habitats for the conservation for bats and the pest-suppression services they provide in agricultural ecosystems.",

Insectivorous bats use these highly productive ecosystems and are likely to be impacted by their decline in quality. We compared bat activity and richness and invertebrate biomass and richness across a gradient of lagoon quality (9 lagoons) in the Greater Sydney region, Australia to determine the extent to which bats and their prey were impacted by lagoon degradation. Bats were more diverse and 19 times more active at higher quality lagoons. The trawling bat, Myotis macropus, was absent from all low quality lagoons, but these lagoons were used by other species such as Miniopterus schreibersii oceanensis. Invertebrate richness and biomass did not differ signiﬁcantly across lagoon quality. We examined potential mechanisms of insectivorous bat decline at degraded lagoons by measuring toxic metal concentrations in bat fur, invertebrates and sediment. Lead and zinc were detected at environmentally signiﬁcant levels in the sediments of lower quality lagoons. Furthermore, lead concentrations were 6 times the lowest observable adverse effects level for small mammals in the hair of one individual M. macropus. The present study demonstrates that coastal lagoons support a rich bat community, but ongoing development and pollution of these habitats is likely to negatively impact on insectivorous bat species, especially trawling species.",

            "abstractNote": "The combined effects of global climate change and increased anthropogenic use of free water are likely to cause decreases in availability and surface area of water in arid environments. Climate change and water loss are predicted to alter community dynamics, but identifying mechanisms underlying differential responses of species remains a critical conservation challenge. Bats drink in ﬂight and rely on accessible water sources, yet the ability to access water is a function of ﬂight maneuverability. By reducing the size of water sources (to simulate predicted water loss due to climate change/increased human use), we demonstrated species-speciﬁc responses by desert bats based on differences in morphology and ﬂight maneuverability. Under natural conditions, less-maneuverable bats selected larger water sources while maneuverable bats exhibited no preference. When we experimentally reduced surface area, larger, less-maneuverable bats experienced a 69% decrease in the proportion of drinking attempts that were successful (p b 0.05) and increased competition with smaller, maneuverable bats. Our study illustrates how morphology can mediate access to a resource and highlights conservation implications as water becomes more limited in arid environments. Selection for differences in wing morphology and ﬂight ability in insectivorous bats has allowed for coexistence and high species richness at a local scale. However, anticipated reductions in the sizes of water sources due to climate disruption may lead to species with less maneuverability being unable to access water efﬁciently and facing increased competition from more agile bats.",

However, population-level impacts are unknown as we lack basic demographic information about these species. We investigated whether fatalities at wind turbines could impact population viability of migratory bats, focusing on the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), the species most frequently killed by turbines in North America. Using expert elicitation and population projection models, we show that mortality from wind turbines may drastically reduce population size and increase the risk of extinction. For example, the hoary bat population could decline by as much as 90% in the next 50 years if the initial population size is near 2.5 million bats and annual population growth rate is similar to rates estimated for other bat species (λ = 1.01). Our results suggest that wind energy development may pose a substantial threat to migratory bats in North America. If viable populations are to be sustained, conservation measures to reduce mortality from turbine collisions likely need to be initiated soon. Our ﬁndings inform policy decisions regarding preventing or mitigating impacts of energy infrastructure development on wildlife.",

Between 2007 and 2014, 27 of the largest of these islands were sampled for non-volant mammals, bats, reptiles, birds and vascular plants. Here, we evaluate the congruent patterns in species richness and composition among the taxonomic groups and relate these to island-wide attributes. We consider the conservation implications of the observed biodiversity patterns in the context of species replacement, nestedness and the minimum number of islands required to represent all species. While the species-area relationship was consistently supported, the eﬀect of island isolation was observed for the non-volant mammals only. Environmental heterogeneity and spatial arrangement of islands strongly inﬂuenced species compositional patterns. We show that this pattern was largely due to species replacement among islands, rather than nestedness. These patterns reﬂect the greater diversity of regionally endemic species that are largely restricted to the more mesic and extensively rocky islands; whereas the drier islands typically support more widespread generalists. The combined measures of biodiversity patterns we observed indicate that all of the sampled islands have high conservation value. The conservation implications of the apparent lack of nestedness in this island system have relevance for other similar systems including fragmented landscapes.",

To place these novel threats in context for a group of mammals that provides important ecosystem services, we performed the ﬁrst comprehensive conservation status assessment focusing exclusively on the 45 species occurring in North America north of Mexico. Although most North American bats have large range sizes and large populations, as of 2015, 18–31% of the species were at risk (categorized as having vulnerable, imperiled, or critically imperiled NatureServe conservation statuses) and therefore among the most imperiled terrestrial vertebrates on the continent. Species richness is greatest in the Southwest, but at-risk species were more concentrated in the East, and northern faunas had the highest proportion of at-risk species. Most ecological traits considered, including those characterizing body size, roosting habits, migratory behavior, range size, home range size, population density, and tendency to hibernate, were not strongly associated with conservation status. However, nectarivorous bats tended to be more at risk. The conservation status of bats improved from 1985 to 2000 as human disturbances to roosting sites were reduced, but then declined sharply (7%) by 2015 due principally to threats from WNS and wind energy. Although uncertainty about threats from pollution and climate change remain, past experience shows that when threats are clearly identiﬁed and management actions taken, populations can recover.",

            "abstractNote": "Many have asserted that Sacred Natural Sites (SNS) play an important role in nature protection but few have assessed their conservation eﬀectiveness for diﬀerent taxa. We studied sacred groves in Epirus, NW Greece, where a large number of such SNS have been identiﬁed. Based on historical, ethnographic and ecological criteria, we selected eight of these groves and matching control sites and in them we studied fungi, lichens, herbaceous plants, woody plants, nematodes, insects, bats and passerine birds. Our results reveal that the contribution of SNS to species conservation is nuanced by taxon, vegetation type and management history. We found that the sacred groves have a small conservation advantage over the corresponding control sites. More speciﬁcally, there are more distinct sets of organisms amongst sacred groves than amongst control sites, and overall biodiversity, diversity per taxonomic group, and numbers of species from the European SCI list (Species of Community Interest) are all marginally higher in them. Conservationists regard the often small size of SNS as a factor limiting their conservation value. The sizes of SNS around the globe vary greatly, from a few square meters to millions of hectares. Given that those surveyed by us (ranging from 5 to 116 ha) are at the lower end of this spectrum, the small conservation advantage that we testiﬁed becomes important. Our results provide clear evidence that even small-size SNS have considerable conservation relevance; they would contribute most to species conservation if incorporated in networks.",

            "abstractNote": "Wind energy is rapidly growing as a renewable source of energy but is not neutral for wildlife, especially bats. Whereas most studies have focused on bat mortality through collision, very few have quantiﬁed the loss of habitat use resulting from the potential negative impact of wind turbines, and none of them for hub heights higher than 55 m. Such impacts could durably aﬀect populations, creating a need for improvement of knowledge to integrate this concern in implementation strategies. We quantiﬁed the impact of wind turbines at diﬀerent distances on the activity of 11 bat taxa and 2 guilds. We compared bat activity at hedgerows (207 sites) located at a distance of 0–1000 m from wind turbines (n = 151) of 29 wind farms in an agricultural region in the autumn (overall 193,980 bat passes) using GLMMs. We found a signiﬁcant negative eﬀect of proximity to turbines on activity for 3 species (Barbastella barbastellus, Nyctalus leisleiri, Pipistrellus pipistrellus), 2 species-groups (Myotis spp., Plecotus spp.) and 2 guilds (fast-ﬂying and gleaner). Bat activity within 1000 m of wind turbines by gleaners and fast-ﬂying bats is reduced by 53.8% and 19.6%, respectively. Our study highlighted that European recommendations (at least 200 m from any wooded edge) to limit mortality events likely strongly underestimate the loss of bat activity. The current situation is particularly worrying, with 89% of 909 turbines established in a region that does not comply with recommendations, which themselves are far from suﬃcient to limit the loss of habitat use.",

            "abstractNote": "Anthropogenic climate change is one of the main current threats to biodiversity, and it has been linked to species decline. Bats deserve attention because they occupy diﬀerent trophic niches and perform diﬀerent functions in nature, acting as ﬂower pollinators (nectarivores), seed dispersers (frugivores), and pest controllers (insectivores). The eﬀects of climate change on the distribution of bat species occurring in the Carajás National Forest (Eastern Amazon, southeastern Pará state, Brazil) was examined by modeling species distributions. A total of 83 species of bats providing the above mentioned services were analyzed for the years 2050 and 2070 to answer the following two questions: (i) Which species are potentially more sensitive to climate changes and will not be able to ﬁnd suitable areas in Carajás in the future, and (ii) Which are the priority areas that protect the greatest number of species from climate change. Of the total species analyzed, 47 (57%) will potentially not ﬁnd suitable areas in Carajás under the scenarios employed. Pollinators, seed dispersers, and more-generalist (omnivorous) bats will potentially be the most aﬀected, suﬀering a 28–36% decrease in suitable area under the 2070 scenario, which may have implications for the plants with which those species interact. According to the scenarios employed, the Carajás National Forest, as well as other conservation units in Pará, will not protect most species in the future. The most suitable areas are located mainly to the north and west of the state and under varying degrees of conservation: from well-preserved protected areas to areas degraded due to diﬀerent anthropogenic impacts. This study emphasizes that the possible eﬀect of climate change and the location of species protection areas need to be analyzed together to ensure that the areas that will act as potential climate refuges for species in the future are indeed protected.",

            "abstractNote": "In the human dimensions of wildlife management, evaluating stakeholder perceptions of target species helps inform eﬀective conservation eﬀorts. Stakeholder perceptions are invaluable when managing taxa like bats, which may have historically negative cultural preconceptions. However, insectivorous bats provide critical ecosystem services in North America through agricultural insect pest control, and many of these species are threatened by white-nose syndrome (WNS), a disease caused by an invasive fungal pathogen. In Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM), the most visited National Park in the United States (USA), bats are regularly observed roosting in historical buildings by visitors and park employees during summer. As a result, natural and cultural resource managers seek to ensure public safety and protect historical structures while minimizing impacts on bats, especially in light of declines in bat populations as a result of WNS. However, managers lacked information on visitor perceptions of bats and support for potential management action regarding the taxon. From June to August 2016, we surveyed 420 park visitors at three sites in the Cades Cove area of GRSM on their attitudes toward bats, perception of threats to and ecosystem services provided by bats, and support for management of bats. Most respondents supported management action to protect bats in buildings in Cades Cove during summer (76%). Standardized parameter estimates from a multiple linear regression developed with survey data indicated that attitudes toward bats and perception of threats to bats had the greatest eﬀects on support for bat management. Wildlife management and conservation agencies seeking to further cultivate support for management of bats roosting in public spaces may apply these results in the design of tailored programming and outreach materials.",

            "abstractNote": "Infrastructures in natural areas are expanding rapidly worldwide. Consequently, roads, power-lines, and windfarms cause millions of fatalities across several animal groups. Assessing the population impact of these infrastructures requires sound estimates of the total number of fatalities. These estimates can be heavily biased due to diﬀerences in searcher eﬃciency and carcass persistence rates, which may ultimately lead to the incorrect quantiﬁcation of actual mortality, or to the inadequate prioritization of locations for mitigation. We reviewed 294 studies using carcass surveys conducted worldwide and performed analyses on the eﬀects of variables potentially inﬂuencing searcher eﬃciency and carcass persistence rates. Our analytical review, including the largest number of studies to date, the use of multivariate approaches, and the study weighting by sample size, contradicts some previous ﬁndings. Whereas body mass is conﬁrmed as the most important variable accounting for both biases, equally important was the use of dogs in searches, as they increased searcher eﬃciency for small carcasses, and the taxon of carcasses for persistence, as mammals persisted at higher rates than birds and the latter at higher rates than amphibians. Our results provide little support for previous ideas on the inﬂuence of the use of domestic or thawed carcasses on persistence rates. Our ﬁndings contribute to synthesizing knowledge on the main factors aﬀecting the two main mortality biases across carcass ﬁeld experiments, and suggest recommendations for improving survey designs in future studies to minimize the biases identiﬁed.",

Most of the remaining TDF are in South America, including Brazil's Caatinga. Understanding how the biota of TDFs responds to habitat loss and climate change is a scientiﬁc challenge, especially to diversiﬁed groups, such as bats, whose richness and ecological roles in TDF are usually underestimated. We updated and synthesized occurrence data and generated distribution models for Caatinga bats considering present and future scenarios. At least 96 species, 48 genera, and eight families were recorded, including two endemic species; ﬁve additional species may occur in the biome. The highest potential species richness occurs in the east, in the Caatinga/Atlantic Forest ecotone; the lowest in the west, in the Caatinga/Cerrado ecotone. Current and projected deforestation led to a reduction of 65% in areas with very high potential richness, and only 0.4% will remain within current protected areas. In a business as usual scenario (i.e., high and fast habitat loss + low in situ protection + high potential exposure to climate change) the bat fauna of the Caatinga will be negatively impacted. Improving the conservation of roosting and foraging sites, with the expansion and/or creation of protected areas is urgently needed.",

Despite the importance of regenerating secondary forests for tropical biodiversity conservation, studies of temporal eﬀects of matrix regeneration on species responses in fragmented landscapes are scarce. Here, we used an Amazonian whole-ecosystem fragmentation experiment to investigate how changes in matrix quality over time through secondary forest regeneration aﬀect bat assemblages from a functional perspective. We found that forest regeneration in the matrix positively aﬀected functional α diversity, as well as species- and community-level functional uniqueness, reﬂecting an increase of species that perform diﬀerent ecological functions in secondary forest over time. According to functional trait composition, animalivorous species showed the clearest signs of recovery associated with matrix regeneration. Consequently, between-period diﬀerences in functional β-diversity were highest in secondary forest compared to fragments and continuous forest, determined mainly by trait gains. However, ~30 years of secondary forest regeneration were not suﬃcient for the functional recovery of bat assemblages to levels observed in continuous forest. Restoring degraded habitats while protecting primary forest will be an important strategy for safeguarding high functional diversity of bats and their vital contributions to ecosystem functioning in fragmented tropical landscapes.",

However, despite the known importance of conserving common and widespread biodiversity, criteria used to designate a Natura 2000 site are oriented toward rare and/or emblematic biodiversity. In this study, we took advantage of the fact that the management of Natura 2000 is just beginning to assess whether the ﬁve most common bat (Chiroptera) species and one genus in France exhibit a greater relative abundance within rather than outside Natura 2000 boundaries, and three bats communities index: total relative abundance, species richness, Community Habitat specialization index. We model the relative abundance of each taxa and indices using data from a nationwide volunteer-based acoustic survey. We found that three of the six taxa studied exhibit greater relative abundance within Natura 2000 sites (this increase is noteworthy for E. serotinus (× 2.1) and Myotis ssp. (× 3.6)). We also provide evidence that total relative abundance of bat activity and richness are globally higher in Natura 2000 sites (respectively +24% and + 14%) and on average communities are more specialized within Natura 2000 sites. In addition, when the eﬀect of Natura 2000 is adjusted to the main land use types, a signiﬁcant positive eﬀect of Natura 2000 remains for most metrics. The positive Natura 2000 eﬀect appears relatively small compared to the main land use pressure: intensive agriculture and artiﬁcial light at night. However, Natura 2000 has a comparable sized eﬀect as habitat widely recognized as having a positive impact on bats, such as streams.",

            "abstractNote": "Roadkill is among the most severe and insidious causes of impoverishment of vertebrate populations. As large roadkill databases develop, inferences from roadkill data can inform landscape-scale studies with broad conservation aims. The Taiwan Roadkill Observation Network (TaiRON) is one of the largest roadkill databases, and we elucidated taxonomic, seasonal, and temporal trends of roadkill in Taiwan, as well as patterns of protected species roadkill. Notably, the study revealed that snakes were the largest proportion of all roadkill (35%) and 26% of snake roadkills were of protected species. Additionally, the top 23 species of a total 496 species ranked by roadkill abundance made up 50% of the observations. During winter, there were signiﬁcantly fewer roadkill observations of bats, lizards, and snakes, but birds and mammals had fairly consistent roadkill across seasons. Additionally, 19% percent of the observations were of protected species. The staggering magnitude and extent of roadkill observations collected by TaiRON indicates a clear impact of roads of on Taiwan's vertebrate fauna. The patterns demonstrate that certain taxonomic groups are disproportionately killed on roads, and a small number of species account for most of the mortality. Additionally, certain seasons account for higher frequency of road kills, especially for ectothermic taxa. These are important insights, as this means that there are groups that are highly and disproportionately aﬀected by roads. We hope this ﬁrst synthesis of all data from TaiRON provides an understanding of the magnitude of roadkill in Taiwan to inform conservation action.",

            "abstractNote": "The development of transportation infrastructure has been identiﬁed as one of the main pressures on biodiversity. The eﬀects of transport infrastructure are more documented for terrestrial mammals, birds and amphibians than for bats. To assess the impacts of roads on bat activity, we carried out full-night acoustic recordings of bat calls at 306 sampling points at diﬀerent distances from a major road at three study sites in France. To assess the relationship between bat activity and the distance to the major road, we performed generalized linear mixed model analyses for thirteen diﬀerent species or groups and additionally explored the non-linear eﬀect with generalized additive mixed models. Our results showed that low-ﬂying species are more aﬀected than high-ﬂying species. Indeed, we found a signiﬁcant negative eﬀect of major roads on bat activity for the ‘clutteradapted’ species, Eptesicus serotinus, Myotis spp., Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Rhinolophus hipposideros. These results demonstrate that the road-eﬀect zone of major roads extends up to ﬁve kilometres. Extrapolating those roadeﬀects zones to the major roads in the European Union, we estimated that 35% of the European Union is potentially negatively impacted. Finally, it seems urgent to consider these road eﬀects with the cumulative eﬀects of other roads by improving habitat connectivity and foraging areas in land use policies. Additionally, to implement drastic conservation practices for species of conservation concern in environmental impact assessment studies, eﬃcient mitigation and oﬀset measures implemented should be sized proportionally to the disturbance caused.",

            "abstractNote": "Conservation action is usually triggered by detecting trends in species’ population size, geographical range, or occupancy (proportion of sites occupied). Robust estimates of these metrics are often required by policy makers and practitioners, yet many species lack dedicated monitoring schemes. An alternative source of data for trend estimation is provided by biological records, i.e., species presence information. In the UK, there are millions of such records, but biological trend assessments are often hindered by biases caused by the unstructured way in which they are collected. Recent advances in occupancy modelling that account for changes in survey effort and detectability over time mean that robust occupancy trends can now be estimated from these records. By grouping mammal species into survey assemblages — species likely to be recorded at the same time — and applying occupancy models, this study provides estimates of long-term (1970 to 2016) occupancy trends for 37 terrestrial mammal species from the UK. The inter-annual occupancy growth rates for these species ranged from -4.26% to 11.25%. This information was used to classify two species as strongly decreasing, five as decreasing, 12 as no change, 11 as increasing and seven as strongly increasing. Viewing the survey assemblages as a whole, the oc­ cupancy growth rates for small mammals were, on average, decreasing (-0.8% SD 1.57), whereas bats and deer (0.9% SD 1.30) were increasing (3.8% SD 3.25; 0.9% SD 1.30 respectively), and mid-sized mammals were stable (-0.3 SD 1.72). These results contribute much-needed information on a number of data deficient species, and provide evidence for prioritising conservation action.",

            "abstractNote": "Connectivity and quality of vegetation in cities, including urban forests, can promote urban biodiversity. However the impact of anthropogenic pressures at the forest-matrix edge, particularly artiﬁcial light at night (ALAN), on connectivity has received little attention. We assessed the inﬂuence of artiﬁcial light at forest edges on insectivorous bats. We acoustically surveyed 31 forest edges across greater Sydney, Australia, half with mercury vapour streetlights and half in ambient darkness, and compared the bat assemblage and activity levels to urban forest interiors. We also sampled the ﬂying insect community to establish whether changes in insect densities under lights drive changes in insectivorous bat activity. We recorded 9965 bat passes from 16 species or species groups throughout our acoustic survey. The activity of all bats, and bats hypothesised to be sensitive to artiﬁcial light, was consistently higher in forest interiors as opposed to edges. We found that slower ﬂying bats adapted to cluttered vegetation or with a relatively high characteristic echolocation call frequency; Chalinolobus morio, Miniopterus australis, Vespadelus vulturnus, and Nyctophilus spp., were negatively aﬀected by artiﬁcial light sources at the forest edge. The emergence time of Vespadelus vulturnus was also signiﬁcantly delayed by the presence of streetlights at the forest edge. Conversely, generalist faster ﬂying bats; Chalinolobus gouldii, Ozimops ridei, Austronomous australis, Saccolaimus ﬂaviventris, and Miniopterus orianae oceanensis, were unaﬀected by artiﬁcial light at the edge of urban forest, and used light and dark forest edges in a similar way. Insect surveys showed that larger lepidopterans seemed to be attracted to lit areas, but in low numbers. Artiﬁcial light sources on the edges of urban forest have diverse eﬀects on bats and insects, and should be considered an anthropogenic edge eﬀect that can reduce available habitat and decrease connectivity for lightsensitive species.",

            "abstractNote": "Urbanisation is among the most ecologically damaging change in land use, posing significant threats to global biodiversity. Most bat species are threatened by urbanisation, although urban areas can also offer important roosting and foraging opportunities. Urban development should consider how bats are likely to respond to development, and take measures to minimise impacts. We used acoustic data from four years of citizen science monitoring (2013–2016) to quantify the importance of fine-scale habitat configuration and composition for bats in urban areas in eastern England. Bat distribution and activity were analysed in relation to remote sensing data representing impervious surface, waterbodies and tree-cover density. Furthermore, hypothetical future scenarios of urban development were considered, assuming an increase in impervious or woodland surface. Lakes and discontinuous woodland were the most selected habitats and urban areas were the least selected, with Barbastellus, Myotis and Plecotus species being the most vulnerable. Nyctalus, Pipistrellus and Eptesicus species were less influenced by the presence of urban areas. Our results suggest that urban growth should be sought through the expansion of existing urban blocks, rather than creating new urban patches, to minimise impacts on commuting or foraging sites. Creating bat-friendly habitat of an area at least equal to any new urban settlement could provide mitigation for negative effects of urbanisation. Opportunities to increase areas of discontinuous woodland should be encouraged, while preserving unmanaged areas within large plantations would likely support the exploitation of continuous woodland by bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Wind energy is an important sector of the renewable energy market. Observations of bat fatalities at wind farms raise concern about impacts to biodiversity, particularly amid projections of wind energy build-out. We inves­ tigated how continued wind energy development in the United States and Canada, as well as adoption of measures to reduce bat fatality rates, influence the population viability of the hoary bat (L. cinereus). Our model included uncertainty about population size and dynamics as well as future wind energy development. Results indicate that current levels of wind energy build-out may have already caused substantial population declines. Under our lowest-risk scenario of high maximum growth rate and low wind energy build-out, the median simulated population of 2.25 million hoary bats experienced a 50% decline by 2028. We show that risks of decline and extinction may still be mediated with rapid adoption of measures to reduce bat fatalities. We find that levels of fatality reduction shown to be achievable in empirical studies of fatality minimization, by turbine curtailment, may be sufficient to manage risks. Simulations of population trends suggest that declines exceeding 5% per year support fatality reduction to manage extinction risk. Importantly, both the risks and the level of fatality reduction necessary to manage them were highly uncertain. Population size remains the most critical data gap to determining population viability of hoary bats. Studies to empirically determine baseline estimates of population size and trends over time remain urgently needed to inform conservation action.",
