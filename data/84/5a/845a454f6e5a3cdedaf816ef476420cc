            "abstractNote": "Factor analysis (FA) has the advantage of highlighting each semi‐distinct cluster of samples in a data set with one axis at a time, as opposed to simply arranging samples across axes to represent gradients. However, in the case of presence–absence data it is confounded by absences when gradients are long. No statistical model can cope with this problem because the raw data simply do not present underlying information about the length of such gradients. Here I propose an easy way to tease out this information. It is a simple emendation of FA called stepping down, which involves giving an absence a negative value when the missing species nowhere co‐occurs with the species found in the relevant sample. Specifically, a binary co‐occurrence graph is created, and the magnitude of negative values is made a function of how far the graph must be traversed in order to link the missing species with each species that is present. Simulations show that standard FA yields inferior results to FA based on stepped‐down matrices in terms of mapping clusters into axes one‐by‐one. Standard FA is also uninformative when applied to a global bat inventory data set. Step‐down FA (SDFA) easily flags the main biogeographic groupings. Methods like correspondence analysis, non‐metric multidimensional scaling, and Bayesian latent variable modelling are not commensurate with SDFA because they do not seek to find a one‐to‐one mapping of axes and clusters. Stepping down seems promising as a means of illustrating clusters of samples, especially when there are subtle or complex discontinuities in gradients.",

            "abstractNote": "Several hypotheses have been advanced for the origin and diversification of the bat fauna of the New World. Traditional models considered one of the families (Vespertilionidae) to have had a North American origin, whilst the diversification of other seven families was thought to have occurred in South America. Present‐day patterns of diversity are the result, according to these hypotheses, of the mixing of faunas, mostly coinciding with the Great American Biotic Interchange (GABI) of the Americas. Recent research has challenged the traditional model and has posited the possibility of dual centres of diversification (in South and North America) for families traditionally considered of strict South American origin. Here we examine the latitudinal patterns of bat diversity and endemism at the genus level and show that present‐day patterns are more consistent with this dual‐diversification hypothesis than with the traditional models. We document an asymmetrical latitudinal gradient of genus richness with a plateau near the equator, but with a decline in Central America and Mexico; however, in this area the relative number of genera, considering the species richness, is higher than expected by chance, as shown by a proper null model. The distribution and identity of endemic genera are consistent with models considering a North American origin for two of the families (Vespertilionidae and Natalidae), an early arrival to South America for another family (Molossidae), and a complex diversification process, involving two centres of diversification, for at least two of the families of the Noctilionoidea (Mormoopidae and Phyllostomidae) and possibly for the Emballonuridae. The recently identified Panamanian Realm (including southern Mexico and Central America) seems to have played a significant role in the diversification of New World bats.",

            "abstractNote": "In tropical rainforests environmental conditions vary dramatically from the ground to the canopy, resulting in a marked stratification in the way vertical space is used by organisms, but research work is often limited to the understorey layer. Aerial insectivorous bats are a highly diverse group that plays key roles in the ecology of rainforests, but their use of vertical space remains elusive.\n            Using automatic ultrasound recording stations placed in the canopy, subcanopy and understorey we tested if bat activity and species diversity are vertically stratified, both in the forest interior and near the edges of water bodies. These patterns were tested separately for individual species, and for two functional groups – open space and edge space bats.\n            \n              Insectivorous bat activity increased by roughly seven fold, and species diversity doubled, from the understorey to the canopy. Both edge space and open space bats were more active in the upper strata, but this tendency was much more accentuated in the latter.\n              Myotis riparius\n              was the only species with greater activity near the understorey. These patterns were altered at the edges of water bodies, where vertical stratification was much less marked.\n            \n            The observed patterns are parsimoniously explained by constraints imposed by vegetation clutter that change across strata, which affect bat species differently. Only bats better adapted to closed spaces are usually capable of foraging within the understorey, whereas the majority of species can exploit the free spaces immediately below the canopy; open space bats seem to concentrate their activity above the canopy. This importance of the inter strata open spaces for bat foraging highlights the need to preserve pristine stratified rainforests, as even selective logging usually disrupts vertical stratification. Moreover, the concentration of insectivorous bats at the upper strata of rainforests underlines the need to include canopy level sampling in ecological studies.",

            "abstractNote": "The ever‐growing popularity of citizen science, as well as recent technological and digital developments, have allowed the collection of data on species' distributions at an extraordinary rate. In order to take advantage of these data, information of varying quantity and quality needs to be integrated. Point process models have been proposed as an elegant way to achieve this for estimates of species distributions. These models can be fitted efficiently using Bayesian methods based on integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) with stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). This approach uses an efficient way to model spatial autocorrelation using a Gaussian random field and a triangular mesh over the spatial domain. The mesh is constructed by user‐defined variables, so effectively represents a free parameter in the model. However, there is a lack of understanding about how to set these mesh parameters, and their effect on model performance. Here, we assess how mesh parameters affect predictions and model fit to estimate the distribution of the serotine bat,\n              Eptesicus serotinus\n              , in Great Britain. A Bayesian INLA model was fitted using five meshes of varying densities to a dataset comprising both structured observations from a national monitoring programme and opportunistic records. We demonstrate that mesh density impacted spatial predictions with a general loss of accuracy with increasing mesh coarseness. However, we also show that the finest mesh was unable to overcome spatial biases in the data. In addition, the magnitude of the covariate effects differed markedly between meshes. This confirms that mesh parameterisation is an important and delicate process with implications for model inference. We discuss how species distribution modellers might adapt their use of INLA in the light of these findings.",

Bats were sampled on 11 islands and the adjacent mainland in Panama, and in eight forest fragments and nearby continuous forest in Brazil. Species–area relationships (SAR) were assessed based on Chao1 species richness estimates, and functional diversity–area relationships (FAR) were quantified using Chao1 functional diversity estimates measured as the total branch length of a trait dendrogram. FARs were calculated using three trait sets: considering five species functional traits (FARALL), and trait subsets reflecting ‘diet breadth’ (FARDIET) and ‘dispersal ability’ (FARDISPERSAL). We found that in both study systems, FARALL was less sensitive to habitat loss than SAR, in the sense that an equal reduction in habitat loss led to a disproportionately smaller loss of functional diversity compared to species richness. However, the inhospitable and static aquatic matrix in the island ecosystem resulted in more pronounced species loss with increasing loss of habitat compared to the countryside ecosystem. Moreover, while we found a significant FARDISPERSAL for the island ecosystem in relation to forest cover within 500 m landscape buffers, FARDIET and FARDISPERSAL were not significant for the countryside ecosystem. Our findings highlight that species richness and functional diversity in island and countryside ecosystems scale fundamentally differently with habitat loss, and suggest that key bat ecological functions, such as pollination, seed dispersal and arthropod suppression, may be maintained in fragments despite a reduction in species richness. Our study reinforces the importance of increasing habitat availability for decreasing the chances of losing species richness in smaller fragments.",

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is having an unprecedented impact on hibernating bat populations in the eastern United States. While most studies have focused on widespread mortality observed at winter hibernacula, few have examined the consequences of wing damage that has been observed among those bats that survive hibernation. Given that WNS-related wing damage may lead to life-threatening changes in wing function, we tested the hypothesis that reduced abundance of free-ranging little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) with severe wing damage as the summer progresses is due to healing of wing tissue. Photographs of captured and recaptured adult females were examined for wing damage and healing rates were calculated for each category of wing damage index (WDI = 0–3). We found that free-ranging bats with severe wing damage were able to heal to a lower WDI score within 2 weeks. Bats with the most severe wing damage had faster healing rates than did individuals with less damage. We also found a signiﬁcant relationship between body condition and WDI for adult females captured in the early weeks of the active season. Our results support the hypothesis that some bats can heal from severe wing damage during the active season, and thus may not experience increased mortality associated with reduced functions of wings. We urge researchers and wildlife managers to use caution when interpreting data on WDI to assess the impact of WNS on bat populations, especially during the later months of the active season.",

The mode of ﬂying-fox to horse transmission remains unclear, but oro-nasal contact with ﬂying-fox urine, faeces or saliva is the most plausible. We used GPS data logger technology to explore the landscape utilisation of black ﬂying-foxes and horses to gain new insight into equine exposure risk. Flying-fox foraging was repetitious, with individuals returning night after night to the same location. There was a preference for fragmented arboreal landscape and non-native plant species, resulting in increased ﬂying-fox activity around rural infrastructure. Our preliminary equine data logger study identiﬁed signiﬁcant variation between diurnal and nocturnal grazing behaviour that, combined with the observed ﬂyingfox foraging behaviour, could contribute to Hendra virus exposure risk. While we found no signiﬁcant riskexposing difference in individual horse movement behaviour in this study, the prospect warrants further investigation, as does the broader role of animal behaviour and landscape utilisation on the transmission dynamics of Hendra virus.",

Myanmar sits at the intersection of numerous bioregions and contains habitats that are important for many endangered and endemic species. This rapidly developing country also forms a connection between hotspots of emerging human diseases. We deployed Global Positioning System collars to track the movements of 10 Indian ﬂying fox (Pteropus giganteus) in the agricultural landscapes of central Myanmar. We used clustering analysis to identify foraging sites and high-utilization areas. As part of a larger viral surveillance study in bats of Myanmar, we also collected oral and rectal swab samples from 29 bats to test for key emerging viral diseases in this colony. There were no positive results detected for our chosen viruses. We analyzed their foraging movement behavior and evaluated selected foraging sites for their potential as human-wildlife interface sites.",

We tested the hypothesis that the adaptation of vampire bats to hematophagy would have resulted in shared viral communities among vampire bats and cattle, as a direct result of historic spillover events occurring due to hematophagy. We analyzed the presence of different viruses in sample populations of sympatric bat and prey populations and searched for shared viruses between taxa. A limited number of DNA viral groups were detected within each species. However, there was no evidence for a shared viral community among the vampire bat and cattle populations tested.",

            "abstractNote": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus that can pose a serious threat to human and livestock health. Old-world fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) are the natural reservoir hosts for NiV, and Pteropus lylei, Lyle’s ﬂying fox, is an important host of NiV in mainland Southeast Asia. NiV can be transmitted from bats to humans directly via bat-contaminated foods (i.e., date palm sap or fruit) or indirectly via livestock or other intermediate animal hosts. Here we construct risk maps for NiV spillover and transmission by combining ecological niche models for the P. lylei bat reservoir with other spatial data related to direct or indirect NiV transmission (livestock density, foodborne sources including fruit production, and human population). We predict the current and future (2050 and 2070) distribution of P. lylei across Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Our best-ﬁt model predicted that central and western regions of Thailand and small areas in Cambodia are currently the most suitable habitats for P. lylei. However, due to climate change, the species range is predicted to expand to include lower northern, northeastern, eastern, and upper southern Thailand and almost all of Cambodia and lower southern Vietnam. This expansion will create additional risk areas for human infection from P. lylei in Thailand. Our combined predictive risk maps showed that central Thailand, inhabited by 2.3 million people, is considered highly suitable for the zoonotic transmission of NiV from P. lylei. These current and future NiV transmission risk maps can be used to prioritize sites for active virus surveillance and developing awareness and prevention programs to reduce the risk of NiV spillover and spread in Thailand.",

We incorporate and describe recent taxonomic changes and new records for the country made since the last list published in 2003. New records and taxonomic changes were considered only if they had verifiable evidence. To date, the list of mammals for the country includes 406 native species, belonging to 11 orders, 46 families and 196 genera, representing an increase of 51 species over the 2003 list. Among those added, 14 were new to science and have type localities in Bolivia. The most diverse orders were Rodentia (148 species), Chiroptera (138), Didelphimorphia (35) and Carnivora (27); a total of 25 species are endemic to Bolivia. In addition, 14 species of introduced mammals are listed. Additional records and taxonomic changes are expected as a result of biological inventories currently in execution, re-identification of specimens deposited in national and foreign mammal collections, and future taxonomic revisions.",

The Maghrebian mouse-eared bat, Myotis punicus Felten, 1977 is classified by the IUCN Red List as a species of missing data and it is a specie whose knowledge of hunting habitat and diet are virtually unknown in Algeria. In our contribution we have studied the diet of the specie In the area located in the region of Kabylia Babors, in wilayates (districts) of Bejaia and Jijel in Algeria between the months of march 2007 and January 2008. The protocol used consisted of a sampling of guano in the different sites used by the species and the identification of remains of insects under microscope For analysis, samples of guano have been soaked at least one hour in 70% alcohol before being dissected using forceps under a binocular magnification 400× and the determination was made with a help of the identification key by Shiel et al. (1997). The results suggests that Myotis punicus in the studied sites of Algeria consumed prey belonging to three groups of arthropods: insects (frequence 96.06%),chilopods (2.82%) and spiders (1.12%).",

However, relatively little attention has been devoted to the urban ecology of bats despite their ubiquity and ecological importance. We conducted a study during 1997-1999 to acoustically monitor species-specific distributions and activity patterns für bats in a highly urbanized landscape. Of 11 896 passesrecorded during the study that satisfied Dur criterion für species classification, 8672 (73%) were identified to species.We identified calls tram five species (Eptesicusfuscus, Lasionycteris noctivagans,Lasiurus borealis, Lasiurus cinereus,Pipistrellus subfiavus) and the Myotis group.Few landscape variables were significantly related toE. fuscus activity; however, L. borealis and L. noctivagans activity had positive relationship~ with adjacent industrial/commercial land use and an urban index. We determined mean occurrence at monitoring sites für all identified species,and each speciesanq the Myotis group exhibited positive re~ationships with the urban index. More species were detected in habitat fragments within urbanized landscapes,and each of these species was detected more frequently in urban areas than in more rural habitat fragments. Correspondenceanalysis su.ggestedcommunity structure was similar among classes of urbanization, with E. fuscus predominant, although fewer species occurred in rural areas, Urban areas may represent islands of habitat für same bats within larger landscapes dominated by intensive agriculture. Thus, the nature of the relationship between urbanization and bats is probably dependent on context at the macrogeographic scale and local habitat quality within the urban matrix.",

Furthermore, methods to compare responses between scales have lacked the ability to discriminate among patterns related to the identity, strength, or direction of associations of biotic variables with landscape attributes. We present an examination of the relationship of population- and communitylevel characteristics of phyllostomid bats with habitat features that were measured at multiple spatial scales in Atlantic rain forest of eastern Paraguay. We used a matrix of partial correlations between each biotic response variable (i.e., species abundance, species richness, and evenness) and a suite of landscape characteristics to represent the multifaceted associations of bats with spatial structure. Correlation matrices can correspond based on either the strength (i.e., magnitude) or direction (i.e., sign) of association. Therefore, a simulation model independently evaluated correspondence in the magnitude and sign of correlations among scales, and results were combined via a meta-analysis to provide an overall test of signiﬁcance. Our approach detected both species-speciﬁc differences in response to landscape structure and scale dependence in those responses. This matrix–simulation approach has broad applicability to ecological situations in which multiple intercorrelated factors contribute to patterns in space or time.",

            "abstractNote": "As tropical regions are converted to agriculture, conservation of biodiversity will depend not only on the maintenance of protected forest areas, but also on the scope for conservation within the agricultural matrix in which they are embedded. Tree cover typically retained in agricultural landscapes in the neotropics may provide resources and habitats for animals, but little is known about the extent to which it contributes to conservation of animal species. Here, we explore the animal diversity associated with different forms of tree cover for birds, bats, butterflies, and dung beetles in a pastoral landscape in Nicaragua. We measured species richness and abundance of these four animal taxa in riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, live fences, and pastures with high and low tree cover. We recorded over 20 000 individuals of 189 species including 14 endangered bird species. Mean abundance and species richness of birds and bats, but not dung beetles or butterflies, were significantly different among forms of tree cover. Species richness of bats and birds was positively correlated with tree species richness. While the greatest numbers of bird species were associated with riparian and secondary forest, forest fallows, and pastures with >15% tree cover, the greatest numbers of bat species were found in live fences and riparian forest. Species assemblages of all animal taxa were different among tree cover types, so that maintaining a diversity of forms of tree cover led to conservation of more animal species in the landscape as a whole. Overall, the findings indicate that retaining tree cover within agricultural landscapes can help conserve animal diversity, but that conservation efforts need to target forms of tree cover that conserve the taxa that are of interest locally. Preventing the degradation of remaining forest fragments is a priority, but encouraging farmers to maintain tree cover in pastures and along boundaries may also make an important contribution to animal conservation.",

In general, however, reserve networks have been selected for different objectives, and most countries lack an evaluation of their reserves' ability to represent a percentage of the national diversity. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a network of reserves to represent the species of mammals in Mexico. The focus of the analyses is on species and site level, evaluating the representationof all terrestrialmammals in the 30 most important reserves.The representation of all species, endemic species, endangered species, and species with restricted distributions in the reserves was assessed and compared. Endemic or endangered species with restricted distributions were expected to be less represented in reserves than were widespread species. The most important reserves for the conservation of mammals were determined with the use of complementarity analyses. Priority sites for the representation of all the species currently absent from the reserve network were then selected.",

We investigated the potential effects of a major pesticide spill by comparing annual survival rates using mark–recapture techniques on a riparian bat species, Yuma Myotis (Myotis yumanensis). Demography and population dynamics for most bat species remain poorly understood despite advances in mark–recapture estimation and modeling techniques. We compared survival and population growth rates of two roost populations exposed to a large chemical (metam sodium) spill in the upper Sacramento River in Northern California with two roost populations outside the contaminated area from 1992 to 1996. Hypotheses about long-term effects of the spill on female juvenile and adult survival were tested using an information-theoretic approach (AIC). Working hypotheses included effects of age, chemical spill, and time trend on survival. Female adult survival was higher than female juvenile survival across all sites, suggesting stage-speciﬁc mortality risks. Model-averaged estimates of female juvenile survival in the contaminated area (0.50 – 0.74) were lower than in control roosts (0.60 – 0.78) for each year in the study, suggesting that the spill may have reduced juvenile survival for several years. Female adult survival (0.73 – 0.89) did not appear to be strongly affected by the spill during the years of the study. There was an increase in survival for both stage-classes across all populations during the study period, which may have been caused by the end of an extended drought in California in the winter of 1993. The spill-affected population was in decline for the ﬁrst year of the study as indicated by an estimated growth rate (k) , 1, but population growth rates increased during the four-year period.",

This GE revolution occurred for cotton in a span of slightly more than a decade during which a switch occurred in major cotton production areas from growing 100% conventional cotton to an environment in which 95% transgenics are grown. Ecological interactions between GE targeted insects and other insectivorous insects have been investigated. However, the relationships between ecological functions (such as herbivory and ecosystem transport) and agronomic beneﬁts of avian or mammalian insectivores in the transgenic environment generally remain unclear, although the importance of some agricultural pest management services provided by insectivorous species such as the Brazilian free-tailed bat, Tadarida brasiliensis, have been recognized.",

However, previous studies have focused mainly on nonspatial variables. This research investigated factors that determined the abundance and species richness of hibernating bats in hibernation objects of the New Dutch Waterline, The Netherlands, and determined the relevant scales over which spatial factors operate using regression techniques and ecological-niche factor analyses. The effects of 32 predictor variables on several response variables, i.e., the total bat abundance, species richness, and abundance and presence of bat species, were investigated. Predictor variables were classiﬁed as internal variables (e.g., building size, climatic conditions, and human access) or external variables (e.g., ground and vegetation cover and land cover type) that were measured at different spatial scales to study the inﬂuence of the spatial context. The internal building variables (mainly the size of hibernacula and the number of hiding possibilities) affected the hibernating bat abundance and species richness. Climatic variables, such as changes in temperature and humidity, were less important. The hibernation site suitability was also inﬂuenced by spatial variables at a variety of scales, thereby indicating the importance of scaledependent species–environment relationships. The absence of human use and public access enhanced hibernation site suitability, but the internal size-related variables had the greatest positive effect on hibernation site suitability. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the different spatial scales of the surrounding landscape to better understand habitat selection, and they offer directives to managers to optimize objects for hibernating bats and to improve management and bat conservation. The analyses have wider applications to other wildlife–habitat studies.",

            "abstractNote": "Long-distance migration evolved independently in bats and unique migration behaviors are likely, but because of their cryptic lifestyles, many details remain unknown. North American hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus cinereus) roost in trees year-round and probably migrate farther than any other bats, yet we still lack basic information about their migration patterns and wintering locations or strategies. This information is needed to better understand unprecedented fatality of hoary bats at wind turbines during autumn migration and to determine whether the species could be susceptible to an emerging disease affecting hibernating bats. Our aim was to infer probable seasonal movements of individual hoary bats to better understand their migration and seasonal distribution in North America. We analyzed the stable isotope values of non-exchangeable hydrogen in the keratin of bat hair and combined isotopic results with prior distributional information to derive relative probability density surfaces for the geographic origins of individuals. We then mapped probable directions and distances of seasonal movement. Results indicate that hoary bats summer across broad areas. In addition to assumed latitudinal migration, we uncovered evidence of longitudinal movement by hoary bats from inland summering grounds to coastal regions during autumn and winter. Coastal regions with nonfreezing temperatures may be important wintering areas for hoary bats. Hoary bats migrating through any particular area, such as a wind turbine facility in autumn, are likely to have originated from a broad expanse of summering grounds from which they have traveled in no recognizable order. Better characterizing migration patterns and wintering behaviors of hoary bats sheds light on the evolution of migration and provides context for conserving these migrants.",

            "abstractNote": "Planting native tree seedlings is the predominant restoration strategy for accelerating forest succession on degraded lands. Planting tree “islands” is less costly and labor intensive than establishing larger plantations and simulates the nucleation process of succession. Assessing the role of island size in attracting seed dispersers, the potential of islands to expand through enhanced seed deposition, and the effect of planting arrangements on seed dispersal by birds and bats informs restoration design. Determining the relative importance of local restoration approach vs. landscape‐level factors (amount of surrounding forest cover) helps prioritize methods and locations for restoration. We tested how three restoration approaches affect the arrival of forest seeds at 11 experimental sites spread across a gradient of surrounding forest cover in a 100‐km\n              2\n              area of southern Costa Rica. Each site had three 50 × 50 m treatments: (1) control (natural regeneration), (2) island (planting tree seedlings in patches of three sizes: 16 m\n              2\n              , 64 m\n              2\n              , and 144 m\n              2\n              ), and (3) plantation (planting entire area). Four tree species were used in planting (\n              Terminalia amazonia\n              ,\n              Vochysia guatemalensis\n              ,\n              Erythrina poeppigiana\n              , and\n              Inga edulis\n              ). Seed rain was measured for 18 months beginning ∼2 years after planting.\n            \n            \n              Plantations received the most zoochorous tree seeds (266.1 ± 64.5 seeds·m\n              −2\n              ·yr\n              −1\n              [mean ± SE]), islands were intermediate (210.4 ± 52.7 seeds·m\n              −2\n              ·yr\n              −1\n              ), and controls were lowest (87.1 ± 13.9 seeds·m\n              −2\n              ·yr\n              −1\n              ). Greater tree seed deposition in the plantations was due to birds (0.51 ± 0.18 seeds·m\n              −2\n              ·d\n              −1\n              ), not bats (0.07 ± 0.03 seeds·m\n              −2\n              ·d\n              −1\n              ). Seed rain was primarily small‐seeded, early‐successional species. Large and medium islands received twice as many zoochorous tree seeds as small islands and areas away from island edges, suggesting there is a minimum island size necessary to increase seed deposition and that seed rain outside of planted areas is strongly reduced. Planting design was more important for seed deposition than amount of forest cover within the surrounding 100‐ and 500‐m radius areas. Establishing plantations and large islands facilitates the arrival of early‐successional tree seeds and represents a broadly applicable strategy for increasing seed rain on abandoned agricultural lands. However, more intensive restoration approaches may be necessary for establishment of dispersal‐limited species.",

Even though avoidance and mitigation measures could benefit from a better knowledge of the species’ migratory habits, we lack basic information about what habitats and corridors bats use during migration. We studied the isotopic niche dimensions of three bat species that are frequently killed at wind turbines in Germany: non‐migratory\n              Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n              , mid‐distance migratory\n              Nyctalus noctula\n              , and long‐distance migratory\n              Pipistrellus nathusii\n              . We measured stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios (δ\n              13\n              C, δ\n              15\n              N) in five tissues that differed in isotopic retention time (fur, wing membrane tissue, muscle, liver, blood) to shed light on the species‐specific habitat use during the autumn migration period using standard ellipse areas (\n              SEA\n              c\n              ). Further, we used stable isotope ratios of non‐exchangeable hydrogen (δ\n              2\n              \n                H\n                K\n              \n              ) in fur keratin to assess the breeding origin of bats. We inferred from isotopic composition (δ\n              13\n              C, δ\n              15\n              N) of fur keratin that isotopic niche dimensions of\n              P. nathusii\n              was distinct from that of\n              N. noctula\n              and\n              P. pipistrellus\n              , probably because\n              P. nathusii\n              was using more aquatic habitats than the other two species. Isoscape origin models supported that traveled distances before dying at wind turbines was largest for\n              P. nathusii\n              , intermediate for\n              N. noctula\n              , and shortest for\n              P. pipistrellus\n              . Isotopic niche dimensions calculated for each sample type separately reflected the species’ migratory behavior.\n              Pipistrellus pipistrellus\n              and\n              N. noctula\n              showed similar isotopic niche breadth across all tissue types, whereas\n              SEA\n              c\n              values of\n              P. nathusii\n              increased in tissues with slow turnaround time. Isotopic data suggested that\n              P. nathusii\n              consistently used aquatic habitats throughout the autumn period, whereas\n              N. noctula\n              showed a stronger association with terrestrial habitats during autumn compared to the pre‐migration period.",

            "abstractNote": "During the last decades, the use of bioacoustics as a non-invasive and costeffective sampling method has greatly increased worldwide. For bats, acoustic surveys have long been known to complement traditional mist-netting, however, appropriate protocol guidelines are still lacking for tropical regions. Establishing the minimum sampling effort needed to detect ecological changes in bat assemblages (e.g., activity, composition, and richness) is crucial in view of workload and project cost constraints, and because detecting such changes must be reliable enough to support effective conservation management. Using one of the most comprehensive tropical bat acoustic data sets, collected in the Amazon, we assessed the minimum survey effort required to accurately assess the completeness of assemblage inventories and habitat selection in fragmented forest landscapes for aerial insectivorous bats. We evaluated a combination of 20 different temporal sampling schemes, which differed regarding number of hours per night, number of nights per site, and sampling only during the wet or dry season, or both. This was assessed under two different landscape scenarios: in primary forest fragments embedded in a matrix of secondary forest and in the same forest fragments, but after they had been re-isolated through clearing of the secondary forest. We found that the sampling effort required to achieve 90% inventory completeness varied considerably depending on the research aim and the landscape scenario evaluated, averaging ~80 and 10 nights before and after fragment re-isolation, respectively. Recording for more than 4 h per night did not result in a substantial reduction in the required number of sampling nights. Regarding the effects of habitat selection, except for assemblage composition, bat responses in terms of richness, diversity, and activity were similar across all sampling schemes after fragment re-isolation. However, before re-isolation, a minimum of four to six sampling hours per night after dusk and three to five nights of sampling per site were needed to detect significant effects that could otherwise go unnoticed. Based on our results, we propose guidelines that will aid to optimize sampling protocols for bat acoustic surveys in the Neotropics.",

Examples include population censusing, which remains difﬁcult despite the demonstrated ecological importance of assessing abundance and density of organisms. We introduce a theoretical framework that connects thermal infrared video imaging with an individual-based simulation model—an approach that appears to be applicable to a diverse set of aggregated, highly mobile, nocturnal animals. To demonstrate the framework two applications are presented. The ﬁrst is a dense aggregation of Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) that exhibits an emergence pattern that has complex dynamics and the second is a sparse local aggregation of agricultural pest moths whose dynamics are insipid. The ﬁrst application uses individual-based modeling to mimic the behavior in the video of bats during a nightly emergence from a cave and to provide reliable estimates of the numbers, and associated error bounds. The second application uses video recordings of sparse aggregations to provide consistent estimates of the numbers of ﬂying noctuid moths recorded over a corn and cottondominated agroecosystem in south-central Texas. This does not use a mathematical model because error estimates tend to be small.",

Unlike birds, insectivorous bats provision their young through lactation, which might protect nursing juveniles when prey availability is low but could increase the energetic burden on lactating females. We analyzed a 15‐year capture–mark–recapture data set from 5312 individual little brown myotis (\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              ) captured at 11 maternity colonies in northwestern Canada, to test the hypothesis that nutritional stress is impacting these mammalian aerial insectivores. We used long‐bone (forearm [FA]) length as a proxy for relative access to nutrition during development, and body mass as a proxy for access to nutrition prior to capture. Average FA length and body mass both decreased significantly over the study period in adult females and juveniles, suggesting decreased access to nutrition. Effect sizes were very small, similar to those reported for declining body size in avian aerial insectivores. Declines in juvenile body mass were only observed in individuals captured in late summer when they were foraging independently, supporting our hypothesis that lactation provides some protection to nursing young during periods of nutritional stress. Potential drivers of the decline in bat size include one or both of (1) declining insect (prey) abundance, and (2) declining prey availability. Echolocating insectivorous bats cannot forage effectively during rainfall, which is increasing in our study area. The body mass of captured adult females and juveniles in our study was lower, on average, after periods of high rainfall, and higher after warmer‐than‐average periods. Finally, survival models revealed a positive association between FA length and survival, suggesting a fitness consequence to declines in body size. Our study area has not yet been impacted by bat white‐nose syndrome (WNS), but research elsewhere has suggested that fatter bats are more likely to survive infection. We found evidence for WNS‐independent shifts in the body size of little brown myotis, which can inform studies investigating population responses to WNS. More broadly, the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (e.g., disease, nutritional stress, climate change, and other pressures) on mammalian aerial insectivores require urgent attention.",

            "abstractNote": "Bird- and bat-mediated biocontrol benefits the productivity of tropical commodity crops such as cacao, but the ecological interactions driving these ecosystem services remain poorly understood. Whereas birds and bats prey on herbivorous arthropods, they may also prey on arthropod mesopredators such as ants, with poorly understood consequences for pest biocontrol. We used a full-factorial experiment excluding birds, bats, and ants to assess their effects on (a) the abundance of multiple arthropod groups; (b) predation pressure on arthropods evaluated through artificial sentinel caterpillars; and (c) cacao yield over 1 year in shaded agroforestry systems of native cacao varieties in Peru. Birds and bats increased cacao yield by 118%, which translates in smallholder benefits of ca. US $959 ha−1 year−1. Birds and bats decreased predation by ants and other arthropods, but contributed to the control of phytophagous taxa such as aphids and mealybugs. By contrast, ant presence increased the abundance of these sap-sucking insects, with negative impacts for cacao yield. Notably, high abundances of the dominant ant Nylanderia sp., known to attend sap-sucking insects, were associated with lower cacao yield along a distance gradient from the closest forest edge. According to these results, arthropod predation by birds and bats, rather than mesopredation by arthropods, was most responsible for increases in cacao yield. Moving forward, detailed research about their trophic interactions will be necessary to identify the cause of such benefits. Retaining and restoring the large benefits of birds and bats as well as minimizing disservices by other taxa in cacao agroforests can benefit from management schemes that prioritize preservation of shade trees and adjacent forests within agroforestry landscapes.",

            "abstractNote": "Although roads are important cultural objects in our society, they can have negative impacts on the environment. Bat populations are affected by roads in several ways, including habitat loss, death due to collision with vehicles, and reduced habitat connectivity. In recent years, different mitigation practices have been introduced to help animals safely cross roads, reduce road kills, and minimize habitat fragmentation. This study aims to investigate to what extent two types of existing wildlife crossings (a green bridge and an underpass) on the A21 highway (in Northern Germany) are used by bats. All-night acoustic recordings of bat activity at the wildlife crossings, on the highway, and in the surroundings show that bats use both mitigation structures. Our results indicate that bats use mitigation structures depending on their degree of clutter-adaptation: Species from the genus Myotis, which are highly clutter-adapted, were the most recorded in the underpass, while Pipistrellus spp., which are less clutteradapted, were the most recorded on the Green Bridge. Contrary to expectations, many bat passes were regis­ tered on the highway as well. Long-term monitoring studies are needed (including counting of bat fatalities) to clarify if further mitigation measures are needed. In conclusion, the use of wildlife crossings as mitigation structures can be effective, mostly for clutter-adapted species (Myotis spp. and Plecotus auritus).",

Although conventional prey–predator dynamics focus on pairs of prey and predator species, the trait‐based approach allows us to draw inferences at the scale of the entire assemblage.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Here, we coupled measurable prey traits with their availability in the study area, to identify the vulnerability of a diverse moth assemblage to predation by the lesser false vampire bat (\n                    Megaderma spasma\n                    )\n                    Chiroptera: Megadermatidae, Linneaus 1758\n                    , a bat with flexible foraging strategies, in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot of India.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We analysed the discarded prey remains from several roosts, collected over 3 years, for seasonal patterns in the diet and selective hunting. Through light‐trapping, we collected moth specimens in different seasons and measured the morphological traits likely to affect their vulnerability to predation, such as body size and evasive flight capability.\n                \n                \n                  Our results showed that consumed moth prey diversity varies seasonally, with moths belonging to the Hepialidae family being preferred in the wet season. We found that the larger moth species with lower evasive capabilities are more vulnerable to predation. Sphingid and Hepialid moths, among the most abundant in the diet, have the lowest manoeuvrability and the maximum body size, respectively. By assessing vulnerability at the prey assemblage level, our study sets the stage for future research on moth–bat interactions from the diverse and less‐explored Paleotropical communities. In addition, the study reiterates the usefulness of trait‐based approaches to understanding prey–predator dynamics.",

            "abstractNote": "Urban green infrastructure, GI (e.g., parks, gardens, green roofs) are potentially important biodiversity habitats, however their full ecological capacity is poorly understood, in part due to the diﬃculties of monitoring urban wildlife populations. Ecoacoustic surveying is a useful way of monitoring habitats, where acoustic indices (AIs) are used to measure biodiversity by summarising the activity or diversity of biotic sounds. However, the biases introduced to AIs in acoustically complex urban habitats dominated by anthropogenic noise are not well understood. Here we measure the level of activity and diversity of the low (0–12 kHz, l) and high (12–96 kHz, h) frequency biotic, anthropogenic, and geophonic components of 2452 h of acoustic recordings from 15 sites across Greater London, UK from June to October 2013 based on acoustic and visual analysis of recordings. We used mixed-eﬀects models to compare these measures to those from four commonly used AIs: Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI), Acoustic Diversity Index (ADI), Bioacoustic Index (BI), and Normalised Diﬀerence Soundscape Index (NDSI). We found that three AIs (ACIl, BIl, NDSIl) were signiﬁcantly positively correlated with our measures of bioticl activity and diversity. However, all three were also correlated with anthropogenicl activity, and BIl and NDSIl were correlated with anthropogenicl diversity. All low frequency AIs were correlated with the presence of geophonicl sound. Regarding the high frequency recordings, only one AI (ACIh) was positively correlated with measured biotich activity, but was also positively correlated with anthropogenich activity, and no index was correlated with biotich diversity. The AIs tested here are therefore not suitable for monitoring biodiversity acoustically in anthropogenically dominated habitats without the prior removal of biasing sounds from recordings. However, with further methodological research to overcome some of the limitations identiﬁed here, ecoacoustics has enormous potential to facilitate urban biodiversity and ecosystem monitoring at the scales necessary to manage cities in the future.",

            "abstractNote": "Rivers host a wealth of biodiversity and play critical ecological functions, so monitoring their environmental status and tracking its changes has paramount importance for appropriate management. Although some biological groups, and especially benthic macroinvertebrates, are employed routinely to achieve this goal, the quest for bioindicators of river quality is far from over, because ﬁnding further suitable organisms may improve indication performances and inform habitat management. Using organisms that are at risk for bioindication also fulﬁlls the goal of providing important information for the conservation of the taxon (or taxa) used for bioindication. Bats are a diverse, threatened mammal group whose characteristics make them potentially suitable bioindicators in many ecosystem types, but research in this ﬁeld is still limited. In this study, set in Central and Southern Italy, we hypothesize that assemblages of foraging bats will respond to environmental status and quality of riverine ecosystems and that therefore bats may serve as eﬀective bioindicators. We established the environmental status of 50 sampling sites selected along 10 rivers using two indices oﬃcially adopted in the country, i.e. the STAR_ICMi (evaluating water quality from macrobenthic invertebrate assemblages) and the ﬂuvial functionality index (Indice di Funzionalità Fluviale, IFF), which incorporates several biotic and abiotic components and represents a functional indicator of river ecosystem health. At the sampling sites, we also recorded bat activity with operator-independent real-time bat recorders and classiﬁed bat passes to species or phonic groups. We examined 167,371 macroinvertebrates and 55,157 bat passes, corresponding to 15 species or phonic groups. The activity of Miniopterus schreibersii/Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Myotis daubentonii/capaccinii declined with increasing values of STAR_ICMi and IFF, while the activity of Nyctalus/Eptesicus serotinus increased with both indices. The activity of P. kuhlii also declined as IFF values increased, while we observed the opposite for Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Myotis emarginatus, Myotis nattereri and Barbastella barbastellus. Pooling together species whose activity respectively increased or decreased as the values of quality indices increased improved indication performances by strengthening statistical signiﬁcance. Our work constitutes a signiﬁcant step towards the use of bats as bioindicators in river ecosystems as we show that diﬀerences in bat activity may reveal changes in environmental conditions and may thus demonstrate the eﬀects of habitat alteration on the river biota. We highlight that locally adapted bat populations may show diﬀerences in foraging behaviour and food preferences; hence our ﬁndings warrant conﬁrmation from other regions. Further constraints are given by the variable degree of taxonomic resolution achieved in bat sound analysis, which may represent an issue especially in species-rich bat assemblages such as those of southern Europe.",

            "abstractNote": "Dynamic occupancy models provide a flexible framework for estimating and mapping species occupancy patterns over space and time for large-scale monitoring programs (e.g., the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat), the Amphibian Research and Monitoring Initiative). Challenges for designing surveys using the dynamic occupancy modeling framework include defining appropriate derived trend parameters, and providing usable tools for researchers to conduct project-specific sample size investigations. We present a simulation-based power analysis framework for dynamic occupancy models that allows for the incorporation of the underlying environmental space (i.e., as covariates) within a specific study region to inform sample size estimation. We investigate two definitions of temporal trend: (1) a gradual, sustained (linear or nonlinear) change over a period of many years, and (2) an abrupt increase or decrease between two time periods. We draw upon pilot data collected following NABat protocols to inform assumed data generating values in a demonstration of our approach. Due to the complicated parameter structure of dynamic occupancy models, we emphasize the importance of visualizing simulated changes over time based on different parameter settings prior to conducting a power analysis. Our simulations revealed that the linearity of short-term trends (five years in our investigation) conferred higher power with lower sample size than longer trends where occupancy probabilities approached zero (ten years in our investigation). We provide an example of how to use our tools to conduct customized investigations using questions posed by NABat, and in doing so, we shed light on general guidelines that can be applied to programs monitoring species occupancy for other taxa. Importantly, we created an R package to execute our approach for informing program-, species-, and study-specific investigations aimed at identifying changes in species occupancy.",

Nevertheless, little research addressed the aggregational and functional responses of bat assemblages to changes in pest availability across a spatio-temporal scale. Therefore, we examined the activity and diet habits of different bat species using DNA metabarcoding by simultaneously monitoring the relative abundance of two major pests (the European grapevine moth, Lobesia botrana, and the leaf rolling tortrix, Sparganothis pilleriana) through the grape growing season, in a vineyard region of the Iberian Peninsula. During pest major irruptions, we found the highest bat activity levels and frequencies of grape pests in the diet of bats, although not all bat species contributed equally to pest suppression. Bats of different foraging guilds positively responded to pest abun­ dances, indicating distinct bat species may synergistically play a role at suppressing agricultural pests at broad scales of the aerospace. For instance, narrow space foragers exploiting major irruptions in grape interior, edge space foragers hampering pest dispersion at local scale, and open space foragers preventing infestations of new grapevine patches at broader scales. Yet, our study exposed the current methodological constraints regarding pest dispersion dynamics, acoustic monitoring of bats’ foraging activity or the unfeasibility of metabarcoding to reliably quantify prey abundance in bats diet, and thus further improvement in these issues is required in order to gain insight on the agroecological interactions between bats and pests.",

Because run-of-the-river dams operate based on smaller reservoirs with limited water storage, they have been generally considered less harmful to the environment, but their actual effects on biodiversity have been rarely measured. We herein estimate immediate impacts resulting from the flooding of the run-of-the-river Santo Antoˆnio Hydroelectric on phyllostomid bat assemblages, based on the variation of their richness, abundance and species composition over the first two years after the establishment of the dam. We designed a standardized study integrating temporal sampling in areas that would and would not be flooded, before and after the establishment of the dam. We sampled 12 Pre-flood plots, and 34 plots that remained unflood. Among the non-flood plots, 25 were resampled after the river damming. We captured 3096 bats belonging to 59 species and found that the abundance of fruit bats decreased posterior to the formation of the dam. Moreover, the composition of fruit bats was different between the sampling periods, with a clear segregation of the va´rzea plots of the pre-flood period. Comparisons between pre- and post-unflood plots revealed that 60% of the plots decreased in abundance of bats, and 68% decreased in abundance of phyllostomid fruit bats. Our results demonstrate that the run-of-the-river dam altered the phyllostomid species composition in the non-flooded areas after the establishment of the dam, reducing the abundance of frugivorous bats. Also, the remaining unflood areas did not incorporate bat assemblages from the va´rzea forests that were permanently flooded by the reservoir. Based on our results, we suggest that environmental policies regulating the licensing processes for the implementation of large hydro­ electric power stations should include orientation for the establishment of protected areas, as a condition for their operation. These areas can work as systematic instruments for biodiversity conservation, with special attention to the protection of the irreplaceable floodplain forests.",

            "abstractNote": "We assessed the sampling effort requirements for detecting the presence of extant bat species following the impact of white-nose syndrome in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. We acoustically sampled 27,796 nights across 846 sites between 15 May and 15 August 2016–2018 within the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. We developed simulations to determine the number of sites required to document bat species when each site was sampled different numbers of nights. We examined these simulations with respect to land cover, physiographic region, and time period. We generally found that sampling a greater number of sample sites within a survey area increased detection more than increasing the number of nights at individual sampling sites. The sampling effort required to detect a given bat species varied by species, as well as land-cover type and physiographic region. Our results suggest that land managers and researchers should use caution in using protocols developed with other objectives, e.g., the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service endangered and threatened bat species and the North American Bat monitoring programs’ methods are designed relative to their specific needs. Unfortunately, neither protocol may be adequate for accurately detecting bat communities within all mid-Atlantic areas.",

            "abstractNote": "Bat populations in eastern North America have experienced precipitous declines following the spread of whitenose syndrome (WNS) and other population stressors. It is imperative to understand changes in bat populations as WNS spreads to provide appropriate guidance for species management. We developed generalized linear mixed-models of population trend and habitat associations for five indicator bat species on U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Mobile Acoustic Bat Monitoring program routes across 86 sites in the southeastern United States from 2012 to 2017. We estimated substantial declining annual trends in relative abundance of tricolored bat (Peri­ myotis subflavus; − 15.1% [− 20.6 to − 9.1% 95% CI]) and little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus; − 13.9% [− 22.9 to − 3.8% 95% CI]). Relative abundance of bat species increased throughout the summer, and associated positively with the amount of woody cover along survey routes in all but P. subflavus. Fewer evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) and eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) were detected along more developed routes. Using these models, we conducted a prospective power analysis to examine sampling effort necessary to detect moderate to catastrophic population changes in bat populations. We estimated that it would require 10–20 years of surveys on 50–100 routes to detect 5% annual declines in all species at 80% power and α = 0.1. Detecting a 2.73% annual decline may require >200 surveys over >20 years; whereas a 1.14% annual decline was nearly impossible to detect via our program. We demonstrate and caution that underpowered monitoring programs may misrepresent the magnitude and/or sign of population trajectories. We recommend project-specific power analysis continue to be emphasized as an important study design component for effective long-term monitoring programs.",

            "abstractNote": "Ecological Infrastructures (EIs) form a network of natural and semi-natural areas crucial to support biodiversity in human-altered landscapes. Several indices have been proposed to assess the ecological quality of EIs, but these have been seldom tested using animal biodiversity as a response variable. The Habitat Ecological Infrastructure’s Diversity Index (HEIDI) was recently developed to assess the potential of EIs in supporting biological commu­ nities with distinct dispersal abilities. In this study, we evaluated the strength of the HEIDI as a proxy of ant (short-range dispersers) and bat (long-range dispersers) activity in two Mediterranean agricultural areas. For this, we applied a Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC) approach and modelled the multi­ specific response of ant and bat communities to the HEIDI values and to the scores of the individual categories that compose it. We additionally adopted a functional methodological approach by selecting as response vari­ ables the activity of functional guilds, namely animal community regulators, decomposers, and seed dispersers for the ant community, and the activity of echolocation guilds, such as short-range (BAT_SRE), mid-range (BAT_MRE), and long-range echolocators (BAT_LRE) for the bat community. Besides the HEIDI, we also used physiognomic and structural EI attributes, as well as the percentage of the agricultural matrix in the ecological area of influence as covariates in the HMSC approach. Our results showed that the HEIDI formula was partic­ ularly accurate in predicting bat activity (posterior mean estimates, βBAT_SRE = 2.80, βBAT_MRE = 0.61, βBAT_LRE = 2.76), but no significant relation was found between HEIDI values and ant activity. In the context of Mediter­ ranean floodplain management, we recommend that practitioners may use the individual HEIDI categorical scores to identify key habitat features that promote ant and bat activity, such as vegetation and aquatic habitats, whilst final HEIDI values may be broadly used to estimate global bat activity.",

            "abstractNote": "Today's acoustic monitoring devices are capable of recording and storing tremendous amounts of data. Until recently, the classiﬁcation of animal vocalizations from ﬁeld recordings has been relegated to qualitative approaches. For large-scale acoustic monitoring studies, qualitative approaches are very time-consuming and suffer from the bias of subjectivity. Recent developments in supervised learning techniques can provide rapid, accurate, species-level classiﬁcation of bioacoustics data. We compared the classiﬁcation performances of four supervised learning techniques (random forests, support vector machines, artiﬁcial neural networks, and discriminant function analysis) for ﬁve different classiﬁcation tasks using bat echolocation calls recorded by a popular frequency-division bat detector. We found that all classiﬁers performed similarly in terms of overall accuracy with the exception of discriminant function analysis, which had the lowest average performance metrics. Random forests had the advantage of high sensitivities, speciﬁcities, and predictive powers across the majority of classiﬁcation tasks, and also provided metrics for determining the relative importance of call features in distinguishing between groups. Overall classiﬁcation accuracy for each task was slightly lower than reported accuracies using calls recorded by time-expansion detectors. Myotis spp. were particularly difﬁcult to separate; classiﬁers performed best when members of this genus were combined in genus-level classiﬁcation and analyzed separately at the level of species. Additionally, we identiﬁed and ranked the relative contributions of all predictor features to classiﬁer accuracy and found measurements of frequency, total call duration, and characteristic slope to be the most important contributors to classiﬁcation success. We provide recommendations to maximize accuracy and efﬁciency when analyzing acoustic data, and suggest an application of automated bioacoustics monitoring to contribute to wildlife monitoring efforts.",

            "abstractNote": "Increasing concern about decline in biodiversity has created a demand for population surveys. Acoustic monitoring is an efﬁcient non-invasive method, which may be deployed for surveys of animals as diverse as insects, birds, and bats. Long-term unmanned automatic monitoring may provide unique unbiased data from a whole season, but the large amount of data presents serious challenges for the automatic processing of the measurements. To demonstrate feasibility of automatic multi-channel surveying using a new prototype hardware, we carried out a 2-month study of echolocating bats requiring high data sampling rates (500 kHz). Using a sound energy threshold criterion for triggering recording, we collected 236 GB (Gi = 10243) of data at full bandwidth. We implemented a simple automatic method using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer based on a combination of temporal and spectral analyses to classify events into bat calls and non-bat events. After experimentation we selected duration, energy, bandwidth, and entropy as classiﬁcation features to identify short high energy structured sounds in the right frequency range. The spectral entropy makes use of the orderly arrangement of frequencies in bat calls to reject short noise pulses, e.g. from rain. The SVM classiﬁer reduced our dataset to 162 MB of candidate bat calls with an estimated accuracy of 96% for dry nights and 70% when it was raining. The automatic survey revealed calls from two species of bat not previously recorded in the area, as well as an unexpected abundance of social calls. The recordings provide data which can be used to correlate bat activity with rain, temperature, and sunset/sunrise. We discuss future applications, achieving higher accuracy in classifying bat calls and the possibility of using trajectory-tracking data to determine bat behavior and correct for the bias toward loud bats inherent in acoustic surveying.",

Despite the clear environmental beneﬁts associated with this type of technology, many studies have conﬁrmed bat fatalities at wind farms, which raise concerns about the long-term effects of these structures on bat populations. To investigate the impact of windmills on bat species, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM) to replicate the underlying behavioural mechanisms for individuals of the species Nyctalus leisleri involved when navigating their habitats at a landscape level, and to simulate the associated mortality events. A set of environmental data layers was used to develop a grid representing a real landscape in terms of habitat types, foraging availability and collision-risk. The model variables were estimated using values from literature. The simulations conﬁrmed the species predominant selection of speciﬁc foraging areas and its high mobility, evidenced by the maximum distances to roosts and home range sizes, highly correlated with the habitats coniferous forests and broadleaf forests. High wind speeds (≥4 m/s) were associated with a decrease in the number of expected fatalities, due to the behavioural limitations imposed to bat activity. Additionally, there was a clear relationship between mortality events and the proximity between roosts and the location of the wind turbines. Overall, these results elucidate the most likely foraging habitats used by the species and the relative risk of the location of windmills. They can inspire future studies of how bat species respond to the infrastructural impacts related with wind farms in mountain areas and/or to the pertinent mitigation measures implemented.",

            "abstractNote": "Open-source species locality data are widely used in species distribution modeling but may be spatially biased by uneven sampling eﬀort across a species' range. Spatial biases may vary across ecological trait groups if traits aﬀect associations with landscape features and capture probability. Furthermore, spatial biases may change across time as research priorities, funding, and methodologies change, which may confound modeling of temporal changes in distributions. We used locality records from 93 bat species from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to characterize the diﬀerential contribution of bias variables to spatial bias and how contribution varied across ecological trait groups. Next, we examined how historical changes in protected area proliferation, economic development, and sampling method advancement aﬀected protected area and university biases. Roosting and foraging traits inﬂuenced spatial bias, but distance to protected areas was the greatest contributor to spatial sampling bias in a pooled model and 8 out of 10 ecological trait group models. Over time, distance to protected areas signiﬁcantly decreased following protected area proliferation, but economic improvement did not inﬂuence distance to universities. Sampling method advancements increased protected area bias for two out of three foraging groups. Although sampling eﬀort has increased over time, eﬀort is becoming more biased towards protected areas, which may not encompass the entirety of species' ranges or allow for equal sampling across taxa. Characterizing spatial bias diﬀerences among species and across time clariﬁes underlying causes of spatial bias, information that can be leveraged to improve spatial bias correction.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats inhabit all continents except Antarctica, and they have enormous potential as bioindicators. Therefore, monitoring bats helps us to understand the surrounding environmental changes. However, bats are nocturnal, which makes it difficult to visually monitor their behavior. This paper proposes a bat species identifier method based on the analysis of ultrasound called echolocation calls, which is a promising method to monitor bats’ activity levels effectively. We develop a robust method to identify the bat species with improved accuracy by analyzing their echolocation calls. First, 1400 sound files with four families, 13 genera, and 30 species were recorded in Japan and the Jincheon-gun in South Korea from 1999 to 2019. Bat echolocation calls were detected from the sound files and used to generate 54,525 spectrograms by applying short-time Fourier transform. We developed a deep learning–based bat species identifier using convolutional neural networks with MobileNetV1 used as the model’s architecture. Furthermore, we applied nested cross-validation with the Bayesian optimiza­ tion algorithm to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters and evaluate the expected performance. We achieved 98.1% accuracy, which outperformed previous studies that treated more than 30 bat species. We visualized important regions of the spectrograms which correspond to prediction using the Guided Grad-CAM. Moreover, we discussed how to treat the noise class and minimize the model training time. Then, we pro­ posed potential solutions to boost the identifier’s performance, the generalization of the echolocation call recording protocols, and applicable techniques to improve the identification accuracy. Future perspectives are 1) to change the deep learning algorithm from image classification to object detection and 2) to apply the proposed identifier to unknown bat echolocation calls to evaluate the feasibility of estimating bat fauna and spatial activity distribution.",

The Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome embodies 321 mammal species; only a small parcel of the species is considered piscivore. The Atlantic Forest biota is threatened by multiple factors, from habitat loss to climate changes. We aimed to understand the current distribution of the six extant piscivore mammals and the distribution of this trophic guild, predicting their distribution under climate change across the Atlantic Forest and identifying areas for the trophic guild conservation prioritizations. We used data on species occurrence based on the GBIF database and literature, and climatic data from WorldClim. We perform Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) to derive the piscivores distribution and the presence of this trophic guild. Our results reveal that piscivores distribution is already restricted in the present (average 8.84%), even the presence of this trophic guild (6.42%). Trophic guild dis­ tribution in the short-term under climate change may represent less than 6.5% across the Atlantic Forest, will be contracting by − 30.0%. We conclude that combinations of factors inductors of biodiversity loss will be empowered by climate changes, leading to more restricted species distribution. SDM is fundamental to under­ stand the species distribution to prioritize conservation efforts from local to pan-continental scales, being paramount to slow down the consequences of climate change.",

            "abstractNote": "Since 2006, the North American bat population has been in rapid decline due to white-nose syndrome (WNS), which is caused by an invasive fungus (Pseudogymnoascus destructans). The little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus) is the species most aﬀected by this emerging disease. We consider how best to prevent local extinctions of this species using mathematical models. In 2017, development began on a new vaccine for WNS; we analyze the eﬀects of implementing vaccination as a control measure. We create a Susceptible-Exposed-InfectiousVaccinated hybrid ordinary diﬀerential equation and diﬀerence equation model informed by the phenology of little brown bats. We compare the eﬀectiveness of annual, biennial, and one-time vaccination programs for multiple durations of immunity length. We also determine the optimal time to vaccinate, if vaccinating only once, as a function of average duration of immunity. Next, we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our results. Finally, we consider other possible control measures together with vaccination to determine the optimal control strategy. We ﬁnd that if the vaccine oﬀers lifelong immunity, then it will be the most eﬀective control measure considered thus far.",

The transmission of these diseases is a complex ecological process that involves interactions between groups of individuals, particularly in gregarious species. White-nose syndrome, caused by the fungus Pseudo­ gymnoascus destructans, is increasingly infecting species of vespertilionid North American bats causing, in some cases, high population mortality. In this study, we modeled ecological niches projected as potential distributions for three strains of P. destructans (Asian, European and North American) and a group of species of verpertilionid bats in North America. Our model showed that the ecological niches of North American and Asian fungi strains are projected to expand into new geographic areas, with statistical significance between the two strains. In addition, our model identified the presence of all three strains of fungi in areas where the fungus has previously been documented as well as new suitable climatic areas for the establishment of P. destructans in North America: large regions of the central USA and highlands of Mexico in the Peninsula of Baja California, the Sierra Madre Occidental and Oriental, and Transvolcanic Mexican Belt. Our models identified 10 species of vespertilionid bats distributed similarly to P. destructans. Bats had a high risk of infection with WSN and a strong likelihood of dispersing the fungus.",

Data were collected during 30 surveys in 13 underground sites, 10 of which had not been surveyed previously by bat researchers, between March 1999 and March 2000. Approximately 20 000 bats representing eight species were recorded. Grouping the sites according to their ecological resemblance, by means of cluster and correspondence analyses, yielded different results for the summer and winter data. In summer, there was a partial separation of the sites by their location in biogeographic regions. In winter, no regional grouping was observed. It was concluded that in the transitory region, species distribution does not differ considerably between the Eastern Thracian and Western Pontic ecosystems. In addition, a conservation scoring system is proposed for those sites investigated, their status is evaluated, and the most important local roosts are identified.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            We investigated the spatial pattern of tree recruitment 15 years after clear‐cutting in two logged strips in the Peruvian Amazon, focusing on differences between seed dispersal modes and cohorts, and relating these to spatial patterns of seed dispersal in the years immediately following clearing. Most trees that recruited in logged strips belonged to taxa dispersed by birds or nonvolant mammals, with smaller numbers dispersed by bats or wind. Seed dispersal patterns differed, with few mammal‐dispersed seeds reaching strips, bird‐dispersed seeds more abundant near the forest edge than strip centers, and bat‐ and wind‐dispersed seeds more evenly distributed. However, this pattern was not reflected in the tree recruits, except in the deferment cut half of strip 2. Different dispersal modes were differentially represented in different cohorts; for example, in strip 1 bird‐dispersed trees predominated in early cohorts, while trees dispersed by nonvolant mammals predominated in later cohorts. Our finding that trees dispersed by mammals (which disperse the majority of commercial trees in Amazonia) successfully regenerate from seed in the interior of logged strips highlights the value of maintaining these animals in forest management systems.",
