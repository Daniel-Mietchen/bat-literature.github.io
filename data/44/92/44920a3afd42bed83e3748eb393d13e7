Analyses of faecal samples and opportunistic observations revealed 40 endemic plant species in the diet. The bats mainly eat odorous ripe and juicy berries. No particular fruit colour was predominant in their diet. Both multi- and single-seeded fruits are eaten. Small seeds (1–3.5 mm in length) are usually swallowed whole. Passage through the digestive tract of the flying foxes does not reduce the germination rate of seeds nor the percentage of seeds germinated. This study indicates that the role of flying foxes in both short and long distance seed dispersal for a large number of endemic tree species of the littoral forest should not be underestimated when designing reforestation programs in particular or conservation action plans in general.",

None of the examined species were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium following the global test for heterozygote deficiency. Inbreeding coefficient (FIS) values at the species level also were statistically greater than zero. This may indicate some level of inbreeding in all examined taxa although it seems to be relatively low because significant FIS values were recorded in only 2 swarming sites of M. mystacinus, 2 sites of M. brandtii, and 3 sites of M. alcathoe. However, almost 10% of related individuals sharing 1 parent (i.e., half siblings) were found in the same swarming sites for M. mystacinus and M. brandtii, with fewer observed in M. alcathoe. At the population level, 4.1%, 5.9%, and 8.7% of individuals of M. mystacinus, M. brandtii, and M. alcathoe, respectively, were assigned as full siblings. These figures suggest the possibility of females mating selectively with the same male in more than 1 year.",

            "abstractNote": "The serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus is the most frequently rabies-infected (European bat lyssavirus 1-type, EBLV-1) bat species in Europe. To confirm Lyssavirus infection of this bat in Poland, we tested for the presence of rabies virus RNA from oropharyngeal swabs using RT-PCR. There was a 0.9% (two out of 212 individuals) level of infection within the overall population of serotine bats studied. However, an appreciation of the potential for pathogen transmission and disease risk requires an understanding of the dispersal of the primary host, and any large-scale geographic barriers that may impede gene flow. Thus, we also studied the patterns of bat dispersal via population genetics using nuclear (seven microsatellite loci) and mitochondrial (mtDNA control region) markers, examined in 12 subpopulations distributed across the country. Molecular analyses of microsatellite loci indicated high genetic diversity at all sites (heterozygosity observed, HO = 0.53–0.78), and extremely weak genetic structure in the Polish population of the species. The overall FST was 0.012 (95% confidence interval: 0.006–0.020), and pairwise values ranged from 0.00 to 0.05. Only 22% of individuals were assigned to the subpopulation from which they were sampled. The Bayesian approach implemented in STRUCTURE also confirmed that all examined subpopulations should be treated as a single group, indicating a high level of gene flow. There was some evidence for female philopatry (genetic differentiation was greater in maternally-inherited mtDNA than nuclear DNA) and male-biased dispersal, e.g., HO and the variance of mean assignment were significantly higher in males than in females. Twelve individuals (seven females and five males) were identified as potential first generation migrants. Their migration routes ranged from 60–283 km in females (0 ± SE = 177.9 ± 29.37) to 27–385 km in males (206.4 ± 58.95); surprisingly, no sexual differences were observed and this finding suggests that female-mediated gene flow may occur. MtDNA also produced a strong genetic signal for the demographic expansion (Fu’s FS statistics, FS = -26.30, P < 0.01 and a star-shaped haplotype network), which took place roughly 33,000 years BP, i.e., before the Last Glacial Maximum. The genetic uniformity of the Polish population implies that there is no migration barrier to EBLV-1, at least within the country, and the potential threat of rabies virus spreading via migration of infected animals may be higher than previously thought.",

Multi‐flash stereophotogrammetry, linked with synchronous recording of echolocation calls, was used to reconstruct the three‐dimensional flight paths of bats and to correlate flight behaviour with changes in pulse emission during echolocation. Echolocation calls during commuting flight at the canal were sigmoidal in structure, with an initial steep frequency modulated (FM) sweep followed by a more shallow sweep, ending with a second, rapid FM sweep. Similar calls were produced during the search phase of foraging, though longer duration quasi‐CF (constant‐frequency) calls, with longer interpulse intervals and much reduced initial and final FM sweeps, were produced by bats hunting over a large lake. Overall, calls were generally lower in frequency, with significantly longer pulse durations and interpulse intervals, compared with those of smaller trawling\n              Myotis\n              bats. Flight speeds were compared with predicted optima from aerodynamic models. Commuting bats exceeded predicted maximum range speed, which was considerably higher than that noted for other smaller species of trawling\n              Myotis.\n              Flight speed was significantly higher closer to the roost, at a narrower canal site. A negative correlation between wingbeat frequency and flight speed, and a facultative 1: 1 link between pulse emission and wingbeat during search phase were established. During commuting, the bats flew at a height above that which would normally confer substantial power savings through ground effect. It is argued that, by flying at a lower height, bats would compromise commuting speed. Echolocation calls produced during attempted prey capture were remarkably similar in design to those produced by those other\n              Myotis\n              species that forage in a similar fashion. Prey was detected at 2 m, and reaction distance was 1.8 m. Evidence of a physiological limit on pulse duration and interpulse interval during prey capture is presented. Overlap of emitted pulse and received echo may degrade the performance of echolocation in many bats, and overlap is generally avoided in\n              M. dasycneme\n              except perhaps when the bat is very close to the prey item.",

Individuals were site loyal, but after eviction they moved short distances to new roosts where they tended to produce fewer offspring. The time spent on the first foraging flight, the maximum distance travelled, and the use of feeding areas did not change with exclusion. The results suggest that bats roost to take advantage of site-specific factors that may increase reproductive success.",

Maternity colonies were found in hollows of dead ponderosa pine trees (Pinus ponderosa) and colony members were not loyal to specific trees. Individuals consistently foraged above a 300-m stretch of the Okanagan River, travelling 1.8 km on average from day roosts to the foraging area. There were significant differences in the duration of foraging bouts among different sex and age-classes. The results are compared with data collected in a similar manner for a population in Ontario, where, in contrast to British Columbia, E. fuscus were highly loyal to man-made roost structures and on average travelled less than 1 km to foraging sites that varied nightly. I suggest that the marked difference in both roosting and foraging behaviour is due to differences in the availability and structure of roosts and in the distribution of insect prey.",

However, little is known about which bat species are associated with this behaviour. Here, I present the ﬁrst description of the use of two tents by Recife Broad-nosed Bat, Platyrrhinus reciﬁnus, constructed in leaves of Miconia brunnea in a degraded Brazilian Atlantic forest fragment. Both structures had the architectural style of tents-boat/apical. The shape of the leaves may mediate the architecture of these tents. In addition, they observed that only one male attended the two tents during the same night. This description provides new insights into the biology and behaviour of Platyrrhinus species. I further highlight several unknown for most tent-making bats that merit future research.",

Seven (12.3%) of 57 bats screened in this study showed yeasts in their faeces. Five species of the genus Candida were isolated: C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, C. lusitaniae, C. parapsilosis, and C. pelliculosa. No phospholipase activity was detected in the egg yolk plate assay; however, all isolates demonstrated protease secretion in skim milk agar. Yeasts isolated from bats produced bioﬁlm on the surface of polystyrene plates and all were classiﬁed as intermediate bioﬁlm producers. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for ﬂuconazole in the yeasts varied according to the species. Only one isolate (M34 – C. lusitaniae) was considered susceptible dose-dependent to ﬂuconazole. The yeasts were injected intravenously into Swiss mice, and at 15 days post-infection, the animals were killed and portions of their kidneys cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar medium. All tissues analysed showed positive cultures of Candida spp. This is the ﬁrst study evaluating the presence of fungi in the faeces of bats in an urban region, where the yeast species found were shown to be potentially pathogenic. As bats are commonly found in cities, these ﬁndings indicate the need for continuous surveillance concerning environmental contamination by their excreta.",

The southern Mediterranean peninsulas (Iberian, Italian and Balkan) have been considered the most likely refugia for temperate/warm adapted species. Recent studies however have revealed the existence of extra-Mediterranean refugia, including the existence of cryptic north-west European refugia during the Last Glacial Maxima (24–14.6 kyr BP). In this study we elucidated the phylogeographic history of two sibling bat species, Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus in their western European range. We sequenced the highly variable mtDNA D-loop for 167 samples of P. pipistrellus (n = 99) and P. pygmaeus (n = 68) and combined our data with published sequences from 331 individuals. Using phylogenetic methodologies we assessed their biogeographic history. Our data support a single eastern European origin for populations of P. pygmaeus s.str., yet multiple splits and origins for populations of P. pipistrellus s.str., including evidence for refugia within refugia and potential cryptic refugia in north western Europe and in the Caucasus. This complex pattern in the distribution of mtDNA haplotypes supports a long history for P. pipistrellus s.str. in Europe, and the hypothesis that species with a broad ecological niche may have adapted and survived outside southern peninsula throughout the LGM.",

In predator–prey interactions that involve an active chase, pursuit behaviour can be studied as the collection of rules that dictate how a predator should steer to capture prey. It remains unclear how variable this behaviour is within and across species since most studies have detailed the pursuit behaviour of high-speed, open-area foragers. In this study, we analyse the pursuit behaviour in 44 successful captures by\n              Corynorhinus townsendii\n              , Townsend's big-eared bat (\n              n\n              = 4). This species forages close to vegetation using slow and highly manoeuvrable flight, which contrasts with the locomotor capabilities and feeding ecologies of other taxa studied to date. Our results indicate that this species relies on an initial stealthy approach, which is generally sufficient to capture prey (32 out of 44 trials). In cases where the initial approach is not sufficient to perform a capture attempt (12 out of 44 trials),\n              C. townsendii\n              continues its pursuit by reacting to prey movements in a manner best modelled with a combination of pure pursuit, or following prey directly, and proportional navigation, or moving to an interception point.",

The following parameters were determined for 81 noctule roosts and 27 Daubenton's bat roosts: tree species, type of cavity (woodpecker or natural), entrance height, compass direction of entrance and distance to the edge of the wood. Roost choice of both bat species was similar except that Daubenton's bats used woodpecker cavities less than noctules. Both bat species were selective in their roost choice. Daubenton's bats preferred oaks over beeches, and noctules preferred woodpecker cavities over natural cavities, indicating dependence on woodpeckers. Both bat species preferred to roost close to the edge of the wood. Roosting close to the edge of the wood may reduce commuting ¯ight costs for both species or may be preferable for thermoregulatory reasons.",

            "abstractNote": "Mercury (Hg) is increasing in marine food webs, especially at high latitudes. The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of methyl mercury (MeHg) has serious effects on wildlife, and is most evident in apex predators. The MeHg body burden in birds is the balance of ingestion and excretion, and MeHg in feathers is an effective indicator of overall MeHg burden. Ivory gulls (\n              Pagophila eburnea\n              ), which consume ice-associated prey and scavenge marine mammal carcasses, have the highest egg Hg concentrations of any Arctic bird, and the species has declined by more than 80% since the 1980s in Canada. We used feathers from museum specimens from the Canadian Arctic and western Greenland to assess whether exposure to MeHg by ivory gulls increased from 1877 to 2007. Based on constant feather stable-isotope (\n              δ\n              13\n              C,\n              δ\n              15\n              N) values, there was no significant change in ivory gulls' diet over this period, but feather MeHg concentrations increased 45× (from 0.09 to 4.11 µg g\n              −1\n              in adults). This dramatic change in the absence of a dietary shift is clear evidence of the impact of anthropogenic Hg on this high-latitude threatened species. Bioavailable Hg is expected to increase in the Arctic, raising concern for continued population declines in high-latitude species that are far from sources of environmental contaminants.",

Because mtDNA is inherited maternally, biparentally inherited nuclear markers are often utilized to estimate population structure and gene flow. The pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) exhibits a relatively continuous distribution across arid western North America. A previous mtDNA study suggested little gene flow among populations and identified three distinct phylogroups. We examined population structure of A. pallidus using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) in 187 individuals from 29 localities across the distribution of the species. Eight primer pairs identified 797 polymorphic loci. All analyses indicated that populations in California, British Columbia, and the Baja Peninsula were relatively distinct. Cluster analysis indicated gene flow has been occurring between the Baja Peninsula population and populations to the north and east. The pallid bat appears to be characterized by male-mediated dispersal and gene flow, while females are largely philopatric. While several populations appear to be somewhat distinct, the overall pattern of divergence for A. pallidus is indicative of isolation by distance throughout the majority its range, suggesting significant gene flow has been occurring since populations diverged during Pliocene desert formation and mountain building.",

Placing estimates on dates of divergence for taxa, as well as developing a reliable calibration for a molecular clock, has been problematic due to a deficiency in reliable fossil calibration points, and a lack of statistical power in the analyses available, as well as the mistreatment of the available data. We obtained sequence data from the hypervariable D-loop of the mitochondrial DNA control region of Corynorhinus rafinesquii, C. mexicanus, and the five recognized subspecies of C. townsendii and employed a relaxed molecular clock model to test competing hypotheses of evolution for big-eared bats in North America. Our analyses indicate interspecific divergences occurred during the Pliocene, with C. rafinesquii diverging from the other Corynorhinus relatively early, during periods of increased warmth and significantly higher sea levels, and C. townsendii and C. mexicanus diverging relatively late, possibly during the cooler periods leading up to the Pleistocene. Intraspecific divergences within C. townsendii appear to have occurred as a result of repeated glacial advances during the Pleistocene, with the C. t. ingens and C. t. virginianus lineages arising at relatively the same time as C. t. pallescens and C. t. australis, and recent rapid population decline producing the disjunct distribution of C. t. ingens and C. t. virginianus. Dating and demographic analyses indicate all species of Corynorhinus are likely undergoing population decline.",

            "abstractNote": "The genus Myotis has undergone significant taxonomic revision since the advent of DNA sequencing techniques. Prior morphological examination of Myotis has indicated as many as 4 subgenera correlated with foraging strategies. Recent studies using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data have questioned the validity of these subgenera and have indicated that several taxa may require reevaluation as to their position within Vespertilionidae. Nevertheless, no study has used large-scale nuclear DNA sequencing to examine relationships within Myotis. We generated 4,656 base pairs (bp) of nuclear intron (PRKC1, STAT5A, and THY) and exon (APOB, DMP1, and RAG2) sequence data in addition to 2,866 bp of mtDNA sequence data to test previously hypothesized subgeneric groupings of Myotis. We included 21 species of Myotis from all morphological subgenera previously suggested, representatives of all subfamilies and tribes currently recognized in Vespertilionidae, and multiple representatives of all other families currently included in the superfamily Vespertilionoidea. We also included a representative of the rare African genus Cistugo, because significant doubt exists about its familial position. Our phylogenetic analyses did not support the morphologically defined Myotis subgenera and confirm that morphological similarities among Myotis are the result of convergent evolution. Divergence estimates derived from the total data set were concordant with previous studies, suggesting a middle Miocene trans-Beringian dispersal from Asia colonized North America, with subsequent South American colonization and diversification prior to the formation of the Isthmus of Panama 3–4 million years ago. Myotis latirostris fell outside of Myotis, and the high genetic distance separating it from other Myotis suggested that M. latirostris represented a distinct genus. The genus Cistugo, previously a subgenus within Myotis, fell basal to all vespertilionids, with a high genetic distance separating it from Vespertilionidae. We conclude that Cistugo should constitute a distinct family within Vespertilionoidea. DOI: 10.1644/09-MAMM-A-192.1.",

Eleven populations from four countries (Benin, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Senegal) had comparable levels of genetic diversity, although the two populations in the extreme west (Senegal) had less diversity. Pairwise\n              F\n              ST\n              ranged from 0.02 to 0.28 and increased with geographic distance, even at a regional scale. Gene pools detected by Bayesian clustering seem to be a byproduct of the isolation‐by‐distance pattern rather than representing actual discrete entities. The organization of genetic diversity appears to result essentially from spatially restricted gene flow, with some influences of human seed exchange. Despite the potential for relatively long‐distance pollen and seed dispersal by bats within populations, statistically significant spatial genetic structuring within populations (SGS) was detected and gave a mean indirect estimate of neighborhood size of ca. 45. This study demonstrated that relatively high levels of genetic structuring are present in baobab at both large and within‐population level, which was unexpected in regard to its dispersal by bats and the influence of human exchange of seeds. Implications of these results for the conservation of baobab populations are discussed.",

Results document that A. jamaicensis (sensu Simmons 2005) comprises 3 monophyletic assemblages that are separated phylogenetically by the presence of A. obscurus, A. lituratus, and A. amplus. According to the mitochondrial DNA sequence variation, A. jamaicensis, A. schwartzi, and A. planirostris are appropriate species-level names for these lineages. Haplotypes identiﬁable as A. jamaicensis were absent east of the Andes Mountains in South America; haplotypes of A. schwartzi were documented throughout the Lesser Antilles and from northern Venezuela, and haplotypes of A. planirostris were identiﬁed east of the Andes Mountains in South America, north of the Orinoco River in Venezuela, and from the southern Lesser Antilles. Haplotypes of Artibeus jamaicensis, A. schwartzi, and A. planirostris were identiﬁed sympatrically on Carriacou, a small island in the southern Lesser Antilles that is ecologically monotypic. The magnitude of genetic divergence separating A. jamaicensis, A. planirostris, and A. schwartzi essentially equals the magnitude of genetic divergence distinguishing A. lituratus, A. obscurus, and A. jamaicensis. Studies of the nuclear genome will be required to understand the biological implications of these patterns in the mitochondrial genome.",

This paper describes a new species of the genus Lagaropsylla Jordan & Rothschild, 1921, collected in the Makay Mountains in Madagascar, on the bat Otomops madagascariensis Dorst, 1953. Male differs from L. obliqua Smit, 1957 and L. hoogstraali Smit, 1957 by the hamulus shape, which is markedly higher than large, exhibiting a small “tooth” backwards of the apex; and differs from L. consularis Smit, 1957 by the preoral tuber, the pronotal comb and the ductus ejaculatorius shapes. Female has a sclerite at the ductus bursae base and differs from L. consularis by the preoral tuber shape and rather short spines on the comb. The new species’ discovery is explained, in one hand, by the rarity of the host, and, in the other hand, by the lack of previous bats and ectoparasites studies in the remote Makay Mountains. A new parasite-host association between Araeopsylla martialis (Rothschild, 1903) and O. madagascariensis is mentioned.",

This species is widespread throughout the Neotropics, where it is common in natural areas and also occupies forest patches and cities. In this study, we review the composition of Artibeus lituratus diet in Brazil as well as the size of fruits and seeds, plant geographic origin, and sampling methods used in natural versus urban habitats. We show that Artibeus lituratus is able to consume a higher proportion of exotic fruits with large seeds in urban environments than in natural areas. Fruit diameter was not statistically different between environments, but both fruit and seed diameters are smaller when detected by fecal sampling than by other methods. This difference is likely due to the fact that in natural habitats studies are predominantly based on fecal samples, which hinders the detection of large unswallowed seeds. Consequently, we recommend the use of complementary sampling methods (not only the widely used technique of fecal sorting) in order to produce more accurate descriptions of frugivorous bats’ diets. We suggest that the ability to exploit fruits of exotic plant species including the ones with large seeds may be a key trait for the persistence of A. lituratus in urban habitats.",

This is the Þrst occurrence of ticks on bats in Canada. This is also the Þrst record of C. kelleyi on M. evotis and M. volans. Dates of parasitization ranged from 22 May to 17 October, and the number of ticks per host ranged from 1 to 44 (median two ticks per host). Number of parasitized individuals was signiÞcantly higher in rock-roosting E. fuscus compared with building-roosting E. fuscus, rock- and building-roosting M. lucifugus, and rock-roosting M. ciliolabrum and M. evotis. A signiÞcant sex bias was noted in rockroosting E. fuscus in 2000 with signiÞcantly more females parasitized. The number of ticks per bat host was highest in 2001, corresponding to the driest and hottest summer of the survey.",

It is thought that feeding a diet that is low in iron can prevent the onset of this disease; however, manufacturing a diet with commonly available foodstuffs that contains a sufficiently low iron concentration is difficult. An alternative is to feed captive animals that may be susceptible to this disease potential iron chelators such as tannins that may bind to iron and block its absorption. Using stable isotope methods established in humans, we measured iron bioavailability in straw‐colored fruit bats (\n              Eidolon helvum\n              ) and tested whether tannic acid significantly reduced the extent of iron absorption. Regardless of dose, tannic acid significantly reduced iron absorption (by 40%) and in the absence of tannic acid, iron absorption was extensive in this species (up to 30%), more so than in humans. Species susceptible to iron storage disease may efficiently absorb iron in the gut regardless of iron status, and supplementing these species with tannic acid in captivity may provide an alternative or additional means of preventing the development of this disease.

Although no M. macropus were caught, they were recorded by Anabat detectors at two sites, one at Moira Lakes Flora Reserve and one on the Murray River at Barmah Bridge. These records were within 7 km of each other and near a previous record on the Murray River (Hoye 1995). Despite the rarity of M. macropus in these forests, high levels of microchiropteran activity from 12 other taxa were recorded. On average, one bat pass was recorded for every minute of sampling in the first hour after dark. Eight taxa (Vespadeius vuiturnus, V. regulus, V. darlingtoni, Chaiinolobus gouidii. C. morio, Mormopterus sp. and Tadarida australis) were recorded at more than 70% of sites, while four species (Scoforapens batstoni, Nyctophiius gouldi, Nyctophilus geoffroyi and Myotis macropus) were recorded from less than 40% of sites. River Red Gum forests are particularly important to bats as a mesic habitat in a predominantly semi-arid landscape. Further studies on M. macmpus are required to determine the reason for its rarity in an area with abundant surface water.",

An index of bat abundance was more highly correlated with direct estimates of food density (productive inflorescences) than indirect estimates of food (\n              Banksia\n              trees and total inflorescences). Furthermore, standing crops of nectar‐energy per hectare were better predictors of bat abundance than pollen‐nitrogen per hectare. Adult male mass did not differ significantly across sites of differing food availability, suggesting that the corresponding increase in bat abundance with food reduces the amount of fat an individual can deposit. Although males and females responded similarly to food, adult numbers were more strongly correlated with food supply and they were more likely to be recaptured than juveniles. Energy requirements of blossom bats exceeded availability in four out of nine sites. Flying foxes were heard feeding in large numbers at the remaining five sites, where energy was superabundant for\n              S. australis\n              . In contrast to the conclusions of previous studies of megabats, these results provide the basis for a prediction that nectar‐energy, rather than pollen‐nitrogen, is the primary limiting factor for populations of the blossom bat.",

This study contrasts the roosting and foraging ecology of the eastern forest bat Vespadelus pumilus (Vespertilionidae), one of Australia’s smallest bats, between two sites of differing disturbance history on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. Lorne Flora Reserve (182 ha) is primarily old-growth forest surrounded by regrowth forest and eucalypt plantations, while Swans Crossing is dominated by regrowth and eucalypt plantations established on part of an old dairy farm. A total of 38 bats were tracked during the maternity and mating seasons at the two sites. Roost preferences were determined by comparing trees used as roosts with those randomly available, while foraging bats were triangulated from ﬁxed stations at night. Bats tracked at Lorne Flora Reserve typically roosted in hollows within large, mature trees and showed a strong preference for roosting and foraging (females only) within the Reserve. Lactating females at Swans Crossing roosted in hollows of remnant rainforest trees within a gully and dead eucalypts, while males often roosted in understorey trees (such as Acacia). Dead trees were frequently used as roosts at both sites. Under both disturbance histories, the mean distance of female maternity roosts from creeks was 20 m, indicating that riparian zones provide important roosting habitat for V. pumilus. However, roosts shifted to the mid-slope prior to winter when bats mate. Retention of mature trees in a variety of topographic locations may allow behavioural adjustments with the seasons. Bats caught in the regrowth forest also foraged there, with foraging ranges averaging just 5.3 ha (n ϭ 10), indicating that regrowth is used by this bat for both foraging and roosting.",

            "abstractNote": "Gene flow, maintained through natal dispersal and subsequent mating events, is one of the most important processes in both ecology and population genetics. Among mammalian populations, gene flow is strongly affected by a variety of factors, including the species’ ability to disperse, and the composition of the environment which can limit dispersal. Information on dispersal patterns is thus crucial both for conservation management and for understanding the social system of a species. We used 16 polymorphic nuclear microsatellite loci in addition to mitochondrial DNA sequences (1.61 kbp) to analyse the population structure and the sex-­specific pattern of natal dispersal in the frog-­eating fringe-­lipped bat, Trachops cirrhosus, in Central Panama. Our study revealed that—unlike most of the few other investigated Neotropical bats—gene flow in this species is mostly male-m­ ediated. Nevertheless, distinct genetic clusters occur in both sexes. In particular, the presence of genetic differentiation in the dataset only consisting of the dispersing sex (males) indicates that gene flow is impeded within our study area. Our data are in line with the Panama Canal in connection with the widening of the Río Chagres during the canal construction acting as a recent barrier to gene flow. The sensitivity of T. cirrhosus to human-­ induced habitat modifications is further indicated by an extremely low capture success in highly fragmented areas. Taken together, our genetic and capture data provide evidence for this species to be classified as less mobile and thus vulnerable to habitat change, information that is important for conservation management.",

Water resources in these areas include natural or semi-natural ponds, streams, and drainage ditches. Such water resources, however, are frequently ephemeral when subject to prolonged periods of high temperatures and low precipitation. We hypothesized that home ranges of evening bats (Nycticeius humeralis) would increase in size or shift from urban green spaces into surrounding neighborhoods to access alternative resources, such as residential swimming pools, when water resources in green spaces are scarce. To explore whether seasonal variations in bat home ranges occurred, we radio-tracked resident evening bats in a local park system during their summer activity period 2017–2019 in Fort Worth, Texas, USA. We used Local Convex Hulls created by associating point locations with their nearest neighbor to estimate home range size, location, and the percentage area that fell within the surrounding neighborhood. We compared these variables to temperature and precipitation using various regression models. We successfully tracked 30 bats over the 3-year period and found a positive correlation between home range size and temperature. Home range sizes increased 6-fold when temperatures exceeded 30°C. Our study indicates the importance of urban neighborhoods surrounding green spaces in providing alternative resources, such as water, for bats. If managed appropriately, these urban areas have the potential to act as oases for bat populations.",

Mexican freetailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) live in large colonies in the southern United States, often in urban areas and, as such, could be exposed to the virus from infected humans. We experimentally challenged wild T. brasiliensis with SARS-CoV-2 to determine the susceptibility, reservoir potential, and population impacts of infection in this species. Of 10 bats oronasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, 5 became infected and orally excreted moderate amounts of virus for up to 18 days postinoculation. These ﬁve subjects all seroconverted and cleared the virus before the end of the study with no obvious clinical signs of disease. We additionally found no evidence of viral transmission to uninoculated subjects. These results indicate that while T. brasiliensis are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, infection of wild populations of T. brasiliensis would not likely cause mortality. However, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from T. brasiliensis to or from humans, or to other animal species, is a possibility requiring further investigation to better deﬁne.",

To help determine the impacts of the pandemic virus on North American bat populations, we experimentally challenged big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) with SARS-CoV-2 under BSL-3 conditions. We inoculated the bats both oropharyngeally and nasally, and over the ensuing three weeks, we measured infectivity, pathology, virus concentrations in tissues, oral and rectal virus excretion, virus transmission, and clinical signs of disease. We found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in any examined bat, including no viral excretion, no transmission, no detectable virus in tissues, and no signs of disease or pathology. Based on our findings, it appears that big brown bats are resistant to infection with the SARS-CoV-2. The potential susceptibility of other North American bat species to SARS-CoV-2 remains to be investigated.",

            "abstractNote": "We investigated the extent of geographic variation in the echolocation calls of five species of microchiropteran Vespadelus in eastern Australia. Bat calls were recorded with Anabat II detectors and computers, and analysed using Analook software. A single call parameter, characteristic frequency (the frequency at the end of the flattest part of the call), was used to document changes in echolocation calls over geographic distance. For V. vulturnus and V. regulus, changes in call frequency were abrupt and sizeable (up to 14 kHz), with two or three frequency groups present within each species. In V. darlingtoni, the changes in frequency were gradual across their range, with an isolated island population resembling the closest region on the mainland. One species examined here, V. troughtoni, had calls that were consistent throughout its range. Calls of V. pumilus were also consistent across geographic regions except for at one site (Chichester State Forest). At this site calls occupied only the upper end of the species frequency range. Body size, measured as forearm length for each species, was significantly smaller at inland sites, but did not vary with latitude or consistently with intraspecific call variation. Broad patterns and possible causes of geographic variation in call frequency are discussed. We conclude that confident identifications of Vespadelus calls from the geographic regions outlined in this paper will only be made with reference calls collected from the relevant regions.",

            "abstractNote": "The ovaries of early embryos (40 days post coitum/p.c.) of the bat Carollia perspicillata contain numerous germ-line cysts, which are composed of 10 to 12 sister germ cells (cystocytes). Variability in the number of cystocytes within the cyst and between the cysts (defying the Giardina rule) indicates that the mitotic divisions of the cystoblast are asynchronous in this bat species. Serial section analysis showed that the cystocytes are interconnected via intercellular bridges that are atypical, strongly elongated, short-lived, and rich in microtubule bundles and microﬁlaments. During slightly later stages of embryonic development (44–46 days p.c.), somatic cells penetrate the cyst, and their cytoplasmic projections separate individual oocytes. Separated oocytes surrounded by a single layer of somatic cells constitute the primordial ovarian follicles. The oocytes of C. perspicillata are similar to mouse oocytes and are asymmetric. In both species, this asymmetry is clearly recognizable in the localization of the Golgi complexes. The presence of germ-line cysts and intercellular bridges (although noncanonical) in the fetal ovaries of C. perspicillata suggest that the formation of germ-line cysts is an evolutionarily conserved phase in the development of the female gametes in a substantial part of the animal kingdom. genesis 50:18–27, 2012.

In this study, R. ferrumequinum korai showed a distinct reproductive cycle, unlike other hibernating bat species. The testicular reproductive cycle of R. ferrumequinum korai consists of three main stages. The ﬁrst is the spermatogenesis stage (from April to September), including spermatocytogenesis (which appears from April to May) and spermiogenesis (from June to September). The activity of spermatogenesis was highest in August. The lumen of seminiferous tubules was open from mid-April to mid-October. It was closed from November to March of the following year. The second stage is the phagocytosis stage (from mid-October to mid-November), which is a puriﬁcation process to prepare for new spermatogenesis the following year. This period is called the cleansing period. The third is the dormant stage – that is, a state of holding only spermatogonia and Sertoli cells. It is an adaptation strategy to store energy for long periods of hibernation. Compared to previous studies, spermatogenesis period preceded 1 month earlier. This suggests that temperature increase can impact reproductive development and spermatogenesis.",

The caudal epididymal reproductive cycle consisted of two successive purge stages. The ﬁrst stage of sperm disappearance occurred from April to June. This was a preparation phase for accepting new sperm produced by spermatogenesis, and entailed removing long-stored spermatozoa from the cauda epididymis during the long hibernation period. The second stage of sperm disappearance occurred from July to August, to remove malformed spermatozoa and other residues that were formed during the spermatogenesis process. Therefore, cauda epididymis cleansing lasts about 5 months, from April to August. This period is called the cleansing period. Sperm destruction was achieved by regulating leukocyte phagocytosis and the secretion and uptake by epithelial cells of cauda epididymis. Compared to the author’s previous studies, morphological traits of the cauda epididymis changed 1 month earlier. This suggests that temperature increase can impact reproductive development of the epididymis. Caudal epididymal sperm did not show any sudden morphological change during the long hibernation period after mating. This might be related to a low metabolic rate during hibernation.",

            "abstractNote": "Closely related species have been used as representative systems to investigate the genetic mechanisms involved in the early stages of species differentiation. Previous studies have indicated that variation in gene expression might be a sensitive indicator of initial species divergence, although the role of expression divergence, and especially that associated with phenotypic variation remained relatively undefined. For three organs (cochlea, brain, and liver) from two closely related bat species (Rhinolophus siamensis and R. episcopus), the interspecific and intersubspecific gene expression profiles were compared using transcriptomics in this study. Striking organ specificity of expression was observed, and expression profiles exhibited similarities between cochlea and brain tissues. Numerous differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for each organ in the interspecific comparison (cochlea/brain/liver: 1,069/647/692) and intersubspecific comparison (608/528/368). Functional enrichment analysis indicated vital variation in expression related to the immune system, ion activities, neuronal function, and multisensory system regulation in both comparisons. DEGs relevant to the variation in echolocation calls (RF) were found, and some of them were involved in the pivotal patterns of expression variation. The regulation of immune, ion channel, neural activity, and sophisticated sensory functions at the expression level might be key mechanisms in the early species divergence of bats, and the expression variation related to acoustical signal could have played a crucial part. This study expands our knowledge of gene expression and patterns of variation for three key organs to echolocation at both the interspecific and intersubspecific levels. Further, the framework described here provides insight into the genetic basis of phenotypic variation during the incipient stage of species differentiation.",

However, little is known about their roles in generating novel phenotypes and phenotypic variation during the course of animal evolution. Here, we, for the first time, characterized the miRNAs of the cochlea in an echolocating bat (Rhinolophus affinis). We sampled eight individuals from two R. affinis subspecies with significant echolocation call frequency differences. We identified 365 miRNAs and 121 of them were novel. By searching sequences of these miRNAs precursors in multiple high-­quality mammal genomes, we found one specific miRNA shared by all echolocating bats but not present in all other nonecholocating mammals. The targeted genes of this miRNA included several known hearing genes (e.g., KCNQ4 and GJB6). Together with the matched mRNA-­seq data, we identified 1766 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two subspecies and 555 of them were negatively regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). We found that almost half of known hearing genes in the list of all DEGs were regulated negatively by DEMs, suggesting an important role of miRNAs in call frequency variation of the two subspecies. These targeted DEGs included several important hearing genes (e.g., Piezo1, Piezo2, and CDH23) that have been shown to be important in ultrasonic hearing of echolocating mammals.",

In China, two morphologically similar bent-winged bat species, Miniopterus fuliginosus and Miniopterus magnater were identiﬁed, but their distribution range and genetic differentiation are largely unexplored. In this study, we applied DNA bar codes and two other mitochondrial DNA genes including morphological parameters to determine the phylogeny, genetic differentiation, spatial distribution, and morphological difference of the M. fuliginosus and M. magnater sampled from China and one site in Vietnam. Mitochondrial DNA gene genealogies revealed two monophyletic lineages throughout the Tropic of Cancer. According to DNA bar code divergences, one is M. fuliginosus corresponding to the Chinese mainland and the other is M. magnater corresponding to tropical regions including Hainan and Guangdong provinces of China and Vietnam. Their most recent common ancestor was dated to the early stage of the Quaternary glacial period (ca. 2.26 million years ago [Ma] on the basis of D-loop data, and ca. 1.69–2.37 Ma according to ND2). A population expansion event was inferred for populations of M. fuliginosus at 0.14 Ma. The two species probably arose in separate Pleistocene refugia under different climate zones. They signiﬁcantly differed in forearm length, maxillary third molar width, and greatest length of the skull.",

            "abstractNote": "Since European settlement in Australia, the geographical range of ghost bats (Macroderma gigas) has contracted northwards. Ghost bats are thought to occur in disjunct populations with little interpopulation migration, raising concerns over the current status and future viability of the southernmost colony, which has also been threatened by mining activity. To address these concerns, demographic parameters of the southernmost colony were estimated from a mark–recapture study conducted during 1975–1981. Female bats gave birth to a single young in late spring, but only 40% (22–70%, 95% CI) of females bred in their second year, increasing to 93% (87–97%, 95% CI) for females ≥ 2 years old. Sixty-ﬁve percent of juveniles caught were female. Annual adult survival ranged between 0.57–0.77 for females and 0.43–0.66 for males, and was lowest over winter–spring and greatest in autumn–winter. Juvenile survival for the ﬁrst year ranged between 0.35–0.46 for females and 0.29–0.42 for males. Adult survival varied among seasons, was negatively associated with rainfall, but was not associated with temperature beyond being lower in late winter. Poor survival may result from the inferior daytime roosts that bats must use if water seepage forces them to leave their normal roosts. Although these age-speciﬁc rates of fecundity and survival suggested a declining population, mark–recapture estimates of the population trend indicated stability over the study period. Counts at daytime roosts also suggested a population decline, but were considered unreliable because of an increasing tendency of bats to avoid detection. It is therefore likely that some assumptions in estimating survival were violated. These results provide a caution against the uncritical use of population projections derived from mark–recapture estimates of demographic parameters, and the use of untested indices as the basis for conservation decisions.",

            "abstractNote": "A vaccine that effectively protects immunocompromised patients against invasive aspergillosis is a novel approach to a universally fatal disease. Here we present a rationale for selection and in vivo testing of potential protein vaccine candidates, based on the modification of an immunodominant fungal allergen for which we demonstrate immunoprotective properties. Pulmonary exposure to viable Aspergillus fumigatus conidia as well as vaccination with crude hyphal extracts protects corticosteroid-immunosuppressed mice against invasive aspergillosis (J. I. Ito and J. M. Lyons, J. Infect. Dis. 186:869-871, 2002). Sera from the latter animals contain antibodies with numerous and diverse antigen specificities, whereas sera from conidium-exposed mice contain antibodies predominantly against allergen Asp f 3 (and some against Asp f 1), as identified by mass spectrometry. Subcutaneous immunization with recombinant Asp f 3 (rAsp f 3) but not with Asp f 1 was protective. The lungs of Asp f 3-vaccinated survivors were free of hyphae and showed only a patchy low-density infiltrate of mononuclear cells. In contrast, the nonimmunized animals died with invasive hyphal elements and a compact peribronchial infiltrate of predominantly polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Three truncated versions of rAsp f 3, spanning amino acid residues 15 to 168 [rAsp f 3(15-168)], 1 to 142, and 15 to 142 and lacking the known bipartite sequence required for IgE binding, were also shown to be protective. Remarkably, vaccination with either rAsp f 3(1-142) or rAsp f 3(15-168) drastically diminished the production of antigen-specific antibodies compared to vaccination with the full-length rAsp f 3(1-168) or the double-truncated rAsp f 3(15-142) version. Our findings point to a possible mechanism in which Asp f 3 vaccination induces a cellular immune response that upon infection results in the activation of lymphocytes that in turn enhances and/or restores the function of corticosteroid-suppressed macrophages to clear fungal elements in the lungs.",

We studied torpor use in two free-ranging subtropical sibling species of insectivorous bat, Scotophilus dinganii (A. Smith, 1833) and Scotophilus mhlanganii , during the austral autumn. All S. dinganii (mass 28.9 ± 2.6 g (mean ± SD)) roosted in buildings, whereas all S. mhlanganii (28.0 ± 0.4 g) roosted in the foliage of trees or in a tree cavity. Contrary to what has been seen in other subtropical species, both Scotophilus species used only one bout of torpor per day. Bats entered torpor 2 h after returning from foraging and aroused passively as the roost was heated by the sun the following day. There was a negative correlation between duration of foraging and duration of torpor, probably because bats that foraged longer had less time for torpor. Despite physical differences between roosts, foliage and building roosts appeared equally thermally labile, resulting in torpor bouts of similar depth and duration between individuals of the two species that used such roosts. Cavity-roosting female S. mhlanganii, on the other hand, used torpor bouts that were longer and shallower than those used by its female conspecifics in foliage roosts and female S. dinganii in buildings. Thus, thermal regulatory behaviour was determined more by the type of roost used than by interspecific differences in physiology.",

            "abstractNote": "Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) are one of many species within zoologic collections that frequently develop iron storage disease. The goals of this retrospective multi-institutional study were to determine the tissue distribution of iron storage in captive adult Egyptian fruit bats and the incidence of intercurrent neoplasia and infection, which may be directly or indirectly related to iron overload. Tissue sections from 83 adult Egyptian fruit bats were histologically evaluated by using tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin, trichrome, and Prussian blue techniques. The liver and spleen consistently had the largest amount of iron, but signiﬁcant amounts of iron were also detected in the pancreas, kidney, skeletal muscle, and lung. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 11) was the most common neoplasm, followed by cholangiocarcinoma (4). Extrahepatic neoplasms included bronchioloalveolar adenoma (3), pulmonary carcinosarcoma (1), oral sarcoma (1), renal adenocarcinoma (1), transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder (1), mammary gland adenoma (1), and parathyroid adenoma (1). There were also metastatic neoplasms of undetermined primary origin that included three poorly differentiated carcinomas, a poorly differentiated sarcoma, and a neuroendocrine tumor. Bats with hemochromatosis were signiﬁcantly more likely to have HCC than bats with hemosiderosis (P ¼ 0.032). Cardiomyopathy was identiﬁed in 35/77 bats with evaluable heart tissue, but no direct association was found between cardiac damage and the amount of iron observed within the liver or heart. Hepatic abscesses occurred in multiple bats, although a signiﬁcant association was not observed between hemochromatosis and bacterial infection. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst publication providing evidence of a positive correlation between hemochromatosis and HCC in any species other than humans.",

The pellets collected at 152 sites in central and north-eastern Poland in the years 1990–2008 comprised 17,908 items of vertebrate prey, of which 115 (0.64%) were bats. Tawny owls caught 11 bat species, most frequently Nyctalus noctula, Plecotus auritus and Eptesicus serotinus. The analysis revealed habitat-related differences to the proportions of all tawny owl prey items accounted for by bats, being the highest in urban habitats (2.0%) and suburban forests (0.8%), and the lowest in forest interiors (0.1%). Bat frequency in the diet of tawny owls correlated negatively with that of other mammals pooled together with amphibians. Myotis nattereri and ‘‘aerial hawkers’’ (vs. ‘‘gleaners’’) were taken significantly more often in habitats associated with a large city (parks and suburban forests), and P. auritus in non-urban habitats.",

Diets were determined from microscopic analysis of fecal pellets and compared with arthropods collected in Malaise traps. Although lepidopterans comprised only 21.5% of the available prey, they occurred in > 90% of the pellets examined and accounted for > 85% of the volume of prey consumed. Dipterans, coleopterans, and homopterans occurred in 18.3%, 10.6%, and 6.7% of the feces, respectively, but each accounted for < 5% of the volume of prey consumed. Trichopterans, hymenopterans, and neuropterans also were found in feces but in trace amounts. Our results support the classification of C. t. ingens as a moth specialist, but additional insights are needed to fully understand how its feeding tactics conform to the allotonic frequency hypothesis (i.e., avoiding detection by eared moths). Conservation of this highly endangered North American bat will require, in part, maintenance of habitats capable of supporting abundant populations of Lepidoptera.",

Despite their prevalence in urban environments, limited research has been conducted to determine the features of buildings or of the surroundings that might affect the likelihood of a building being selected by Mexican free-tailed bats as a roost. Our study objectives were to improve the current understanding of Mexican free-tailed bat’s urban roosting preferences with regard to both microhabitat and macrohabitat. Between August 2010 and August 2012, we conducted acoustic surveys and emergence observations and examined 218 buildings in Waco, TX, USA. A total of 54 day-roosts for Mexican free-tailed bats was identified. At the microhabitat scale, modeling of building characteristics and opening characteristics showed that bats preferred to roost in tall and abandoned buildings. Roost exits were more likely the results of structural damage to buildings and less likely to have vegetation blocking the adjacent air space. Roost accessibility seemed to be more important than thermal condition in roost selection. At the broader macrohabitat scale, bats were more likely to roost in areas with lower income and were near tall buildings and water sources.",

Eared moths perform evasive flight manoeuvres upon hearing approaching bats, thereby substantially increasing survival probability. Accordingly, eared moths constitute only a minor portion of many bats’ diets. In contrast, the barbastelle bat\n                      Barbastella barbastellus\n                      almost exclusively feeds on eared moths by emitting low‐amplitude stealth echolocation calls that are undetectable by distant moths. While closing in on the prey, however, the calls might become audible. We thus hypothesised that barbastelle bats lower the source level of their calls even further while closing in, such that the level at the moth's ear remains below the moth's hearing threshold and the moth fails to elicit its evasive manoeuvre.\n                    \n                  \n                  \n                    We tested these hypotheses by offering tethered moths to barbastelle bats in the wild and in captivity. We reconstructed the bats’ three‐dimensional flight paths based on time‐of‐arrival differences of the echolocation calls at four microphones, measured the received sound levels at the moth's position with an additional miniature microphone, and calculated call source levels.\n                  \n                  \n                    We show that barbastelle bats continuously reduced source level upon detecting a moth, thereby delaying the time and shortening the distance when the moth might detect the bat. The received level at the targeted moth never exceeded the moth's neuronal hearing threshold by more than 10 dB, which is likely sufficiently low to prevent moth evasive flight.\n                  \n                  \n                    Barbastelle bats emit low‐amplitude calls to counter moth hearing. Continued amplitude reduction during an attack extends the time before the prey becomes aware of the predator, if at all. In combination, these two strategies allowed barbastelle bats to access a food resource which is largely unavailable to competing species, thereby probably altering competition between sympatric predators.\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                A\n                plain language summary\n                is available for this article.",

            "abstractNote": "The remarkable high-frequency sensitivity and selectivity of the mammalian auditory system has been attributed to the evolution of mechanical amplification, in which sound waves are amplified by outer hair cells in the cochlea. This process is driven by the recently discovered protein prestin, encoded by the gene\n              Prestin\n              . Echolocating bats use ultrasound for orientation and hunting and possess the highest frequency hearing of all mammals. To test for the involvement of\n              Prestin\n              in the evolution of bat echolocation, we sequenced the coding region in echolocating and nonecholocating species. The resulting putative gene tree showed strong support for a monophyletic assemblage of echolocating species, conflicting with the species phylogeny in which echolocators are paraphyletic. We reject the possibilities that this conflict arises from either gene duplication and loss or relaxed selection in nonecholocating fruit bats. Instead, we hypothesize that the putative gene tree reflects convergence at stretches of functional importance. Convergence is supported by the recovery of the species tree from alignments of hydrophobic transmembrane domains, and the putative gene tree from the intra- and extracellular domains. We also found evidence that\n              Prestin\n              has undergone Darwinian selection associated with the evolution of specialized constant-frequency echolocation, which is characterized by sharp auditory tuning. Our study of a hearing gene in bats strongly implicates\n              Prestin\n              in the evolution of echolocation, and suggests independent evolution of high-frequency hearing in bats. These results highlight the potential problems of extracting phylogenetic signals from functional genes that may be prone to convergence.",

It is possible that variation may also exist between genders in the use of different prey types. However, until recently this idea was difficult to test owing to poorly resolved taxonomy of dietary studies. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing to describe gender-related variation in diet composition of the European free-tailed bat (\n              Tadarida teniotis\n              ), while controlling for effects of age and season. We analysed guano pellets collected from 143 individuals mist-netted from April to October 2012 and 2013, in northeast Portugal. Moths (Lepidoptera; mainly Noctuidae and Geometridae) were by far the most frequently recorded prey, occurring in nearly all samples and accounting for 96 out of 115 prey taxa. There were significant dietary differences between males and females, irrespective of age and season. Compared to males, females tended to consume larger moths and more moths of migratory behaviour (e.g.\n              Autographa gamma\n              ). Our study provides the first example of gender-related dietary variation in bats, illustrating the value of novel molecular tools for revealing intraspecific variation in food resource use in bats and other insectivores.",

In the mild winter of 1994–1995, ﬂight cage temperatures never fell below 10ЊC. Bats were never observed to enter sustained (over 2 d) torpor. They were also never observed to mate. Unmanipulated, sham-operated, and gonadectomized males and unmanipulated females were exposed to 6 d of 4ЊC. All individuals appeared torpid, and body temperatures of monitored bats fell at least 15Њ–20ЊC. Plasma androgen levels of torpid unmanipulated, sham-operated, and gonadectomized males averaged 25.4 { 9.2, 19.7 { 9.1, and 1.5 { 0.25 ng/mL, respectively, and did not differ signiﬁcantly from levels for the same groups 1 mo previous to induced torpor. When animals were returned to 23ЊC, 57% of unmanipulated, 40% of the sham-operated, and 33% of gonadectomized males displayed mating behavior upon arousal. Almost all matings occurred within 48 h of arousal, the majority in the ﬁrst 3 h. Males not exposed to low temperatures were not observed to mate. Although individuals from all three treatments mated, gonadectomized males averaged fewer mounts and copulations per individual. Androgen levels declined signiﬁcantly from torpor levels in all groups 48 h after arousal. Thus, an extended period of low body temperature and arousal appeared to be a short-term activator of sexual behavior in the big brown bat; unmanipulated males were more strongly affected by this stimulus than gonadectomized males.",

            "abstractNote": "The Cimicidae is a family of blood‐dependent ectoparasites in which dispersion capacity is greatly associated with host movements. Bats are the ancestral and most prevalent hosts for cimicids. Cimicids have a worldwide distribution matching that of their hosts, but the global classification is incomplete, especially for species outside the most common Cimicidae taxa. In this study, we place a little‐studied cimicid species, Bucimex chilensis, within a comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Cimicidae by sequencing the genomic regions of this and other closely related species. For this study, we collected B. chilensis females from Myotis chiloensis in Tierra del Fuego, 1,300 km further south than previously known southernmost distribution boundary. We also sequenced COI regions from Primicimex cavernis, a species which together with B. chilensis comprise the entire subfamily Primiciminae. Using Bayesian posterior probability and maximum‐likelihood approaches, we found that B. chilensis and P. cavernis clustered close to each other in the molecular analyses, receiving support from similar morphological features, agreeing with the morphology‐based taxonomic placement of the two species within the subfamily Primiciminae. We also describe a previously unrecognized morphological adaptation of the tarsal structure, which allows the austral bat ectoparasite, B. chilensis, to cling on to the pelage of its known host, the Chilean myotis (Myotis chiloensis). Through a morphological study and behavioral observation, we elucidate how this tarsal structure operates, and we hypothesize that by clinging in the host pelage, B. chilensis is able to disperse effectively to new areas despite low host density. This is a unique feature shared by P. cavernis, the only other species in Primiciminae.",

The current study investigates an ascending right turn of a\n              Hipposideros pratti\n              bat and elucidates on the kinematic features and aerodynamic mechanisms used to effectuate the manoeuvre. The wing kinematics captured by a three-dimensional motion capture system is used as the boundary condition for the aerodynamic simulations featuring immersed boundary method. Results indicate that the bat uses roll and yaw rotations of the body to different extents synergistically to generate the centripetal force to initiate and sustain the turn. The turning moments are generated by drawing the wing inside the turn closer to the body, by introducing phase lags in force generation between the wings and redirecting force production to the outer part of the wing outside of the turn. Deceleration in flight speed, an increase in flapping frequency, shortening of the upstroke and thrust generation at the end of the upstroke were observed during the ascending manoeuvre. The bat consumes about 0.67 W power to execute the turning-ascending manoeuvre, which is approximately two times the power consumed by similar bats during level flight. Upon comparison with a similar manoeuvre by a\n              Hipposideros armiger\n              bat (Windes\n              et al\n              . 2020\n              Bioinspir.

We compared biophysical characteristics associated with 34 roost trees and 170 control trees of similar diameter, height and tree senescence characters. Roost trees used by the white-striped freetail bat had signiﬁcantly higher numbers of hollows in the trunk and branches (P < 0.003) and were more likely to contain a large trunk cavity with an internal diameter of >30 cm (P < 0.001) than control trees. These trees also accommodated more species of hollow-using fauna (P = 0.005). When comparing roost trees with control trees of similar diameters and heights, roost trees were on average at a later stage of tree senescence (P < 0.001). None of the roost trees were found in the large forest reserves fringing the Brisbane metropolitan area despite these areas being used for foraging by the white-striped freetail bat. Although all tree locations in this study were in modiﬁed landscapes, roost trees tended to be surrounded by groups of trees and undergrowth.

Notably, bats have been reported to lack obvious symptoms of infection with such viruses and are thought to have unique immune system responses. However, the responses of their innate immune system, the first line of immunity, remain largely unclear. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the expression profiles in two\n              Eptesicus\n              bat cell lines to investigate their innate immune responses. The gene expression profiles after polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly (I:C)] induction were similar between the two bat cell lines, but uniquely upregulated differentially expressed genes were also identified. We also revealed that the upregulated genes of\n              Eptesicus\n              bat cells were distinct from those of human epithelial cells in response to induction. Moreover, the basal expression levels of several immune‐related genes were higher in bat cells than in human cells. We also identified unannotated novel transcripts that were upregulated after induction and novel microRNAs expressed in bat cells, some of which were upregulated by poly (I:C) treatment. This is the first report to illustrate the innate immune response in\n              Eptesicus\n              bat cells; therefore, this study provides basic and novel insights into bat innate immunity. Our data represent a valuable resource for future studies into bat immunity and the biology of\n              Eptesicus\n              bats.",

            "abstractNote": "Dietary analysis of nocturnal aerial insectivores such as bats is not possible by direct visual observation of predation, therefore diet is traditionally determined by analysing dietary remains in scats. Analysing DNA in scats through metabarcoding can reveal dietary items not preserved in faeces but also resolve dietary preferences to species level. DNA metabarcoding analysis of scats collected from six individual long-tailed bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) from Whirinaki Forest Park revealed a predominance of aquatic insects (Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera) and small-bodied moths (Lepidoptera). This contrasts with earlier studies of faecal remains in this species which revealed a strong preference for Dipterans and Coleopterans. The use of DNA metabarcoding may provide a better understanding of diets, as soft-bodied insects can be detected even when not apparent in physical examinations of scat, and thus will allow for more robust comparison of diﬀerences in diets between populations and seasons. The application of DNA metabarcoding is a simple but high-resolution tool to allow further study on dietary preference in this endangered species.",

For small hibernators, torpid metabolic rate is temperature dependent and thus hibernation in warm hibernacula is predicted to be energetically costly. This species, however, rarely feeds during the hibernation season to offset the expected high energetic costs. In this study we used a respirometry system to quantify physiological characteristics of euthermic and torpid H. terasensis in winter. We tested the hypothesis that H. terasensis exhibits metabolic inhibition during torpor. Our results showed that H. terasensis saved 94.6% energy by using torpor at air temperatures of 15uC, compared with its euthermic metabolic rate at that air temperature. Torpor metabolic rate declined with declining air temperature to around 14uC, but then increased at lower air temperatures of 10–14uC. Above 14uC , the slope of 213.0uK 6 1.4uK between metabolic rates and body temperatures in an Arrhenius plot (or Q10 5 4.4) suggests that, in addition to direct temperature effects, H. terasensis exhibited metabolic inhibition during torpor. A model used to evaluate energy expenditure of H. terasensis showed that at 20uC and 23uC a 55-g bat needs 194 kJ (4.9 g fat) and 273.2 kJ (6.9 g fat), respectively, to survive a 70-day hibernation period.",

Population decline may be indeed associated with diet specialization and unavailability of feeding resources, especially in modified environments. We studied the diet and prey selection of Rhinolophus hipposideros Borkhausen, 1797 in a modified Mediterranean landscape in Portugal, where this species is classified as vulnerable. Diet composition was evaluated by analyzing faecal pellets collected in a breeding colony of R. hipposideros, and the available arthropods were sampled using a light trap set outside the roost. The most consumed prey were Lepidoptera, Tipulidae (Diptera), Hymenoptera, Diptera and Neuroptera. Arthropod diversity remained fairly constant in the diet, but not in terms of prey availability. Our results show that R. hipposideros is a generalist species that feeds on a great number of prey species. However, our data suggest that, within the broad dietary niche, R. hipposideros is not opportunistic, actively selecting Diptera as a preferred food item. Despite the marked differences in foraging habitats, our results are closely match to those of studies done in Western and Central Europe, suggesting that R. hipposideros feeds on similar taxa all across Europe. However, as many studies indicate, this species selects broadleaved woodlands and riparian vegetation to forage, so conservation measures should take into account the protection of native forest and the maintenance of forest corridors among them, as R. hipposideros seems to avoid crossing open areas.",

Previous researchers have hypothesized that demographic characteristics of populations may shift with changes in environmental conditions, with self-regulatory ability increasing with environmental suitability. We studied responses of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) to habitat disturbance. Given that optimal habitat for this species is deciduous woodland, we predicted that populations in habitats disturbed by cutting woody vegetation would be lower and more variable in density than in undisturbed habitat, density and stability of populations in disturbed habitat would increase over time, survival would be higher in undisturbed than in disturbed habitat, and populations in undisturbed habitat would show a greater degree of self-regulation. This 6year study in western Pennsylvania involved 3 replicated study sites (each 3.8 ha), with woody vegetation removed on half of each site prior to beginning the study. Density in disturbed treatment averaged 65% of density in undisturbed habitat. There were no differences between treatments in survival or in population growth rates over time. Population trends over time were similar between treatments, populations in disturbed habitat did not become more stable with time, and density did not converge with that of undisturbed habitat. Although populations in the undisturbed habitat were clearly self-regulating, those in disturbed habitats were not. Despite expectations that demographic performance will align with environmental suitability, it may be difficult to ascribe a particular demography to a habitat generalist such as P. leucopus.",

Bats are one of the few groups of mammals where reverse SSD appears. In this group, the size of individuals may have very important ecological consequences related with flight. In this study, we examine sexual dimorphism in the wing measurements of 195 adult individuals (141 males and 54 females) of the greater mouse-eared bat Myotis myotis in the south-east of the Iberian Peninsula. We also investigated size differences between paired and single males in a swarming roost. The results indicate that there are significant differences in the wing measurements between sexes, females being bigger than males in this respect. While no significant differences in the wing measurements of paired and single males were observed, significant differences were found in their relative weight and fitness, single males being significantly heavier and having a better physical condition. We discuss the implications of SSD for the female of M. myotis in terms of reproductive advantages, trophic niche segregation and a greater ability to move, which may favour gene flow between populations.",

            "abstractNote": "The meridional serotine Eptesicus isabellinus (Temminck, 1840) has recently been identified as a cryptic species that occurs in the south of the Iberian Peninsula. Little is known about its ecology. We used morphological analysis of droppings from an urban semiarid Mediterranean landscape to determine seasonal differences in diet. We identified 15 insect prey types and found significant seasonal differences in the consumption of seven prey types. The diet of E. isabellinus was dominated by Scarabaeidae (Coleoptera) and Diptera, and there were seasonal changes in the consumption of Carabidae (Coleoptera), Lepidoptera and Cercopidae (Hemiptera). Shannon-Wiener and Levins’ indices showed that the diet was more diverse during the post-hibernation and pregnancy periods. Pianka’s index showed that there was relatively low dietary overlap between periods. The seasonal changes recorded between different physiological periods could be related to changes in the energetic needs of the individual or to variation in preyavailability. Although E. isabellinus mainly eats Scarabaeidae and Diptera, it can show flexibility for example by hunting insects that fly around blossoms such as chafers Melolontha spp.",

Here we investigated spatial patterns of total Hg (THg) in fur from 10 little brown bat maternity colonies across Nova Scotia, and assessed relationships with the acidity of nearby lakes and rivers. Total Hg concentrations were measured in fur samples from 149 adult female little brown bats. Values showed signiﬁcant variation among colonies (mean range 3.76−27.38 μg/g, dry weight), and 48% of individuals had Hg concentrations in excess of the 10 μg/g threshold associated with neurochemical changes in Chiroptera conspeciﬁcs (n = 26) from Virginia. Average surface water acidity parameters (pH and acid neutralization capacity) within an 8 km radius of each maternity roost showed strong negative associations with average colony fur THg concentrations. This suggests that freshwater acidity in foraging grounds explains much of the variation in average fur THg concentrations in little brown bat colonies. These ﬁndings highlight the signiﬁcant role that water quality may have on Hg bioaccumulation within terrestrial species that feed on aquatic prey.",

Deficiency of IFN-gamma but not IL-17A enhanced susceptibility of control mice to both infections. However, vaccine-induced protective immunity against both infections required CD4+ T-cell-derived IFN-gamma and IL-17A, and functional phagocytic effectors. Vaccination primed Th1, Th17, and Th1/17 lymphocytes, which produced pro-inflammatory cytokines that enhanced phagocytic killing of both organisms. Vaccinated, infected mice had increased IFN-gamma, IL-17, and KC, increased neutrophil influx, and decreased organism burden in tissues. In summary, rAls3p-N vaccination induced a Th1/Th17 response, resulting in recruitment and activation of phagocytes at sites of infection, and more effective clearance of S. aureus and C. albicans from tissues. Thus, vaccine-mediated adaptive immunity can protect against both infections by targeting microbes for destruction by innate effectors.",

We compared the ﬂight morphology and gliding/soaring performance of soaring versus non-soaring Pteropus species, one pair on American Samoa and one pair on the Comoro Islands, and two other soaring/ﬂap-gliding species and one non-soaring species. We predicted that the soaring species should have a lower body mass, longer wings and, hence, lower wing loadings than those species that use mainly ﬂapping ﬂight. This would give a lower sinking speed during gliding, a higher glide ratio, and enable the bats to make tighter turns with lower sinking speeds than in the non-soaring species. We theoretically calculated the gliding and circling performances of both the soaring and non-soaring species.",

It is important to document this relationship because the global decline in pollinators may significantly affect the breeding systems of many animal‐pollinated plants, particularly specialized systems.\n              Ceiba pentandra\n              is a tropical tree that has chiropterophilic flowers and a variable breeding system throughout its distribution, ranging from fully self‐incompatible, to a mixed system with different degrees of selfing. To determine if regional differences in pollinators may result in regional differences in the outcrossing rate of this species, we used systematic observations of pollinator behavior in two tropical life zones and high‐resolution genetic analysis of the breeding system of populations from these two regions using microsatellites. We found a predominantly self‐incompatible system in regions with high pollinator visitation, while in environments with low pollinator visitation rates,\n              C. pentandra\n              changed to a mixed mating system with high levels of self‐pollination.",

            "abstractNote": "Ceiba pentandra is a tropical tree with high rates of selﬁng in some populations. In mixed-mating species, variation in selﬁng is due to changes in adult density or variability of incompatibility systems. The effect of spatial isolation and phenology on selﬁng rates and pollen ﬂow distances was analyzed using microsatellites in a fragmented population of Ceiba pentandra, in southern Costa Rica. Adult trees within a heterogeneous landscape were classiﬁed as grouped or isolated. We compared selﬁng rates at the individual level, between isolation conditions and 2 yr (2007, 2009), which differed in the number of ﬂowering individuals. Mixed mating was estimated in both years (tm = 0.624–0.759). Trees mated predominantly by outcrossing, while only a few trees reproduced through selﬁng. Spatial isolation did not signiﬁcantly affect outcrossing rates. The progeny of grouped trees was mostly sired by near-neighbors (<1 km) and by long-distance pollen ﬂow events in isolated trees. A reduction in the number of ﬂowering individuals in 2009 reduced near-neighbor matings, increased selﬁng in grouped trees, and decreased the number of unsampled sires in the progeny. Comparing selﬁng rates on individuals that ﬂowered in both reproductive periods suggests a ﬂexible mating system. Variation in self-fertilization rates in this population appears to depend on variation of individual traits, such as genetic variability in self-incompatibility genes, but it is independent of landscape heterogeneity. In contrast, pollen ﬂow distances depend on local tree density as bats concentrate their foraging between near individuals to maximize energy efﬁciency.",

The diet of the bats at this site is unique in this respect when compared with P. rufus elsewhere in Madagascar and with other Pteropus species. The dietary breadth of P. ruius at Bercruy is narrow, consisting of only 14 plant species, identified through microsopic faecal analysis and direct Heldobservations, and three unidentified ones. The bats also eat locally cultivated and introduced fruits (Manyifem indica. PsidiLlm d. cattleianwn. Sclerocaru« caiira, Cordia sinensis and HylocereLls species) and native and endemic forest species (Tamaril1dus indica. Celtis phiJippensis. Ficus l11egapoda, F. ureve), F. pachyclada and Grewia species). The majority of the plant species used by P. ruius for food are located within the gallery forests ofthe Mandrare valley. No evidence of adjacent endemic spiny forest species was identified in their diet. Thus, conservation of the remaining gallery forest as well as retention ofthe sisal plantations is important to maintain the food sources ofP. rufus at this site.",

It includes the oldest plant-visiting bat in the New World and some of the earliest representatives of the extant families Phyllostomidae, Thyropteridae, and Noctilionidae. La Venta's\n              Notonycteris magdalenensis\n              is an extinct member of the subfamily Phyllostominae, a group of modern Neotropical animalivorous bats, and is commonly included in studies of the evolution of Neotropical bats, but aspects of its biology remain unclear. In this study, we used multivariate dental topography analysis (DTA) to reconstruct the diet of\n              N. magdalenensis\n              by quantitatively comparing measures of molar complexity with those of 25 modern noctilionoid species representing all major dietary habits in bats. We found clear differences in molar complexity between dietary guilds, indicating that DTA is potentially an informative tool to study bat ecomorphology. Our results suggest\n              N. magdalenensis\n              was probably an omnivore or insectivore, rather than a carnivore like its modern relatives\n              Chrotopterus auritus\n              and\n              Vampyrum spectrum\n              . Also, we reconstructed the body mass of\n              N. magdalenensis\n              to be ~95 g, larger than most insectivorous bats, but smaller than the largest carnivorous bat (\n              V. spectrum\n              ). Our results confirm that\n              N. magdalenensis\n              was not a specialized carnivore. It remains to be demonstrated that the specialized carnivory ecological niche was occupied by the same lineage of phyllostomines from at least the middle Miocene. Combining our diet and body-mass reconstructions, we suggest that\n              N. magdalenensis\n              exhibits morphological pre-adaptations crucial for the evolution of specialized carnivory.",

However, the ecomorphological boundaries of these species are poorly differentiated, and consequently correspondence between their geographic distribution, ecological plasticity and morphological variation remains unclear. In this study, patterns of cranial and mandibular morphological variation were assessed for Carollia brevicauda, C. castanea and C. perspicillata from Colombia. Using geometric morphometrics, morphological variation was examined with respect to: differences in intraspecific variation, morphological modularity and integration, and biogeographic patterns. Patterns of intraspecific variation were different for each species in both cranial and mandibular morphology, with functional differences apparent according to diet. Cranial modularity varied between species whereas mandibular modularity did not. High cranial and mandibular correlation reflects Cranium-Mandible integration as a functional unit. Similarity between the biogeographic patterns in C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata indicates that the Andes do not act as a barrier but rather as an independent region, isolating the morphology of Andean populations of larger-bodied species. The biogeographic pattern for C. castanea was not associated with the physiography of the Andes, suggesting that large body size does not benefit C. brevicauda and C. perspicillata in maintaining homogeneous morphologies among populations.",

            "abstractNote": "One of the major challenges to understanding the evolution of Neotropical bats concerns our capacity to successfully scrutinize phylogenetic patterns associated with cases of cryptic species complexes. In this study Pteronotus parnellii is examined as a selected example of a known lineage of mormoopid bat that potentially contains several cryptic species. A samples of 452 individuals from 83 different localities, essentially covering its entire mainland distribution, was evaluated using two genetic markers: COI (mitochondrial) and DBY (nuclear) genes. The findings of this study strongly support the hypothesis of high genetic variability and identify at least six lineages within P. parnellii, some of which appear to be cryptic species.",
