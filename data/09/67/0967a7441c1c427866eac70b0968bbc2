This single observation adheres to the 3 requirements of teaching outlined by Caro and Hauser (1992). A female bat experienced with a hunting task modified her behavior in the presence of a naïve observing male, resulting in a cost of reduced food availability to the female when she was hungry, while directing the male to food resources and accelerating his learning of a foraging task. The experienced female bat altered her behavior in the presence of a naïve male by nonaggressively approaching the perched male several times before flying to a bowl of live mealworms. Within minutes, her behavior led to the initiation of the foraging task by the naïve male. In sharp contrast, 5 other bats took 4–12 nights to learn this foraging task. Audio recordings of contact calls made during the interaction show possible information transfer via acoustic signals. We hope this lone observation will stimulate research on teaching in bats.",

Road networks and energy extraction infrastructure are both spatially extensive and rapidly expanding sources of noise. We predict that predators reliant on acoustic cues for hunting are particularly sensitive to louder environments. Here we examined the foraging efﬁciency of pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) when exposed to played-back trafﬁc and gas compressor station noise in the laboratory. We show that both types of noise at each of ﬁve exposure levels (58–76 dBA, 10–640 m from source) and low-level ampliﬁer noise (35 dBA) increase the time required for bats to locate prey-generated sounds by twofold to threefold. The mechanism underlying these ﬁndings is unclear and, given the potential landscape-level habitat degradation indicated by our data, we recommend continued research into the effects of noise exposure on acoustically specialized predators.",

We found a regular rhythm in three multisyllabic vocalization types (echolocation call sequences, male territorial songs and pup isolation calls) of the neotropical bat\n              Saccopteryx bilineata\n              . The intervals between element onsets were used to fit the rhythm for each individual. For echolocation call sequences, we expected rhythm frequencies around 6–24 Hz, corresponding to the wingbeat in\n              S. bilineata\n              which is strongly coupled to echolocation calls during flight. Surprisingly, we found rhythm frequencies between 6 and 24 Hz not only for echolocation sequences but also for social vocalizations, e.g. male territorial songs and pup isolation calls, which were emitted while bats were stationary. Fourier analysis of element onsets confirmed an isochronous rhythm across individuals and vocalization types. We speculate that attentional tuning to the rhythms of echolocation calls on the receivers' side might make the production of equally steady rhythmic social vocalizations beneficial.",

This concerns particularly the specific attribution of marginal populations from the Mediterranean islands and from adjacent areas of North Africa and Asia, which are morphologically intermediate between continental\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              from Europe. This study attempts to clarify this question by using four different approaches: cranial morphology, external morphology, genetics and trophic ecology. The three latter methods show unambiguously that North Africa, Malta, Sardinia and Corsica are presently inhabited by monospecific populations of\n              M. myotis\n              . In contrast, cranial morphometrics do not yield conclusive results. These results contradict all recent studies, which attribute North African and Maltese mouse‐eared bats to\n              M. blythii\n              and consider that Sardinia and Corsica harbour sympatric populations of the two species. As concerns south‐eastem populations, doubts are also expressed about the attribution of the subspecific taxon\n              omari\n              which may actually refer to\n              M. myotis\n              instead of\n              M. blythii.\n              Protein electrophoresis is presently the only absolute method available for determining\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              throughout their distribution ranges. However, species identification may be approached by relying on less sophisticated morphometrical methods as presented in this study. Species‐specific habitat specializations are probably responsible for the differences observed between the geographic distributions of\n              M. myotis\n              and\n              M. blythii\n              , as they provide a logical groundwork for a coherent model of speciation for these two bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "In active sensing, animals make motor adjustments to match sensory inputs to specialized neural circuitry. Here, we describe an active sensing system for sound level processing. The pallid bat uses downward frequencymodulated (FM) sweeps as echolocation calls for general orientation and obstacle avoidance. The bat’s auditory cortex contains a region selective for these FM sweeps (FM sweep-selective region, FMSR). We show that the vast majority of FMSR neurons are sensitive and strongly selective for relatively low levels (30-60 dB SPL). Behavioral testing shows that when a flying bat approaches a target, it reduces output call levels to keep echo levels between ϳ30 and 55 dB SPL. Thus, the pallid bat behaviorally matches echo levels to an optimized neural representation of sound levels. FMSR neurons are more selective for sound levels of FM sweeps than tones, suggesting that across-frequency integration enhances level tuning. Level-dependent timing of high-frequency sideband inhibition in the receptive field shapes increased level selectivity for FM sweeps. Together with previous studies, these data indicate that the same receptive field properties shape multiple filters (sweep direction, rate, and level) for FM sweeps, a sound common in multiple vocalizations, including human speech. The matched behavioral and neural adaptations for low-intensity echolocation in the pallid bat will facilitate foraging with reduced probability of acoustic detection by prey.",

            "abstractNote": "For a better understanding of the complex coevolutionary processes between hosts and parasites, accurate identification of the actors involved in the interaction is of fundamental importance. Blood parasites of the Order Haemosporidia, responsible for malaria, have become the focus of a broad range of studies in evolutionary biology. Interestingly, molecular-based studies on avian malaria have revealed much higher species diversity than previously inferred with morphology. Meanwhile, studies on bat haemosporidian have been largely neglected. In Europe, only one genus (Polychromophilus) and two species have been morphologically described. To evaluate the presence of potential cryptic species and parasite prevalence, we undertook a molecular characterization of Polychromophilus in temperate zone bats. We used a nested-PCR approach on the cytochrome b mitochondrial gene to detect the presence of parasites in 237 bats belonging to four different species and in the dipteran bat fly Nycteribia kolenatii, previously described as being the vector of Polychromophilus. Polychromophilus murinus was found in the four bat species and in the insect vector with prevalence ranging from 4% for Myotis myotis to 51% for M. daubentoni. By sequencing 682 bp, we then investigated the phylogenetic relationships of Polychromophilus to other published malarial lineages. Seven haplotypes were found, all very closely related, suggesting the presence of a single species in our samples. These haplotypes formed a well-defined clade together with Haemosporidia of tropical bats, revealing a worldwide distribution of this parasite mostly neglected by malarial studies since the 1980s.",

We examined variation patterns in the resting frequency (RF) of echolocation calls emitted by the intermediate leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros larvatus, on a broad geographical scale. Data mining technology and Kruskal–Wallis test both showed substantial variation with a longitudinal pattern in RF in H. larvatus among colonies, and this variation was associated with geographical distance and not body size. In addition, we found that a high degree of variability between individuals was hidden under the geographical variation. The results support an effect of random cultural drift, and challenge the prey detection hypothesis. Moreover, an acoustic difference among local island colonies may be indicative of a vocal dialect. We found that each colony of H. larvatus seems to maintain a ‘private bandwidth’, which could be used for colony identity and individual communication thus helping individuals and colonies to get a number of ﬁtness beneﬁts.",

The genome is found to be 17,470 bp in length and has a base composition of A (33.1%), G (13.6%), C (24.6%), and T (28.6%). Similar to other bats, it contains a typically conserved structure including 13 protein-coding genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, and 1 control region (D-loop). Most of the genes are encoded on H-strand, except for the eight tRNA and ND6 genes. All protein-coding genes start with an ATG codon except for ND2, ND3 and ND5, which initiate with ATC or ATA instead, and terminate with the typical stop codon (TAA/TAG) or a single T (T– –) or an unexpected codon of AGA. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence provided here would be useful for further phylogenetic analysis and population genetic studies in M. brandtii.",

Significant differences in RF were observed among populations throughout the species range in Mainland China, and this variation was positively and significantly related to climate conditions, especially environmental humidity, but the variability was only weakly associated with geographical distance. Sex dimorphism in the RF of R. pusillus may imply that female and male might keep their frequencies within a narrow range for sex recognition. Moreover, bats adjusted resting frequency to humidity, which may imply partitioning diet by prey size or the influence of rainfall noise. The results indicate that bats adjust echolocation call frequency to adapt to environmental conditions. Therefore, environmental selection shape the diversity of echolocation call structure of R. pusillus in geographically separated populations, and conservation efforts should focus on changes in local climate and effects of environmental noise.",

Bartonella and hemotropic mycoplasmas are bacteria that parasite different mammals’ species, including humans, causing different clinical manifestations. The present work aimed investigating the occurrence and assessing the phylogenetic positioning of Bartonella spp. and Mycoplasma spp. in neotropical bats sampled from Brazil. Between December 2015 and April 2016, 325 blood and/or tissues samples were collected from 162 bats comprising 19 different species sampled in ﬁve states of Brazil. Out of 322 bat samples collected, while 17 (5·28%) were positive to quantitative PCR for Bartonella spp. based on nuoG gene, 45 samples (13·97%) were positive to cPCR assays for hemoplasmas based on 16S rRNA gene. While seven sequences were obtained for Bartonella (nuoG) (n = 3), gltA (n = 2), rpoB (n = 1), ftsZ (n = 1), ﬁve 16S rRNA sequences were obtained for hemoplasmas. In the phylogenetic analysis, the Bartonella sequences clustered with Bartonella genotypes detected in bats sampled in Latin America countries. All ﬁve hemoplasmas sequences clustered together as a monophyletic group by Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses. The present work showed the ﬁrst evidence of circulation of Bartonella spp. and hemoplasmas among bats in Brazil.",

Sixty bats of both sexes were used for this study. The tongue was excised, and the weight and various linear measurements were determined. Linear measurements were also determined on the hard palate. The gross distribution of the lingual papillae was observed to be the same in both sexes; values obtained for the weight and length of the tongue were higher in the females, although no statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed (P > 0.05). The number of ridges on the hard palate displayed sexual dimorphism. Results obtained from this study may ﬁnd application in the ﬁeld of comparative and clinical anatomy of wildlife and also in feeding physiology.",

Free association and flight were permitted, and mother‐infant pairs were identified and marked on the day of birth (day 0). Suckling associations were identified daily (n = 195) and females were never found suckling young other than their own. A series of choice experiments using young aged 0–10 days and 15–25 days indicated that females would permit only their own offspring to suckle during both early and late lactation. During early lactation, mothers actively selected their young and encouraged suckling but did not do so during late lactation. Mothers were most often indifferent to approaches by alien young but occasionally aggressively rejected them. Mothers never aggressively rejected their own young but frequently were indifferent to them. Young attempted to suckle from any mother without discrimination.",

The taxonomic status of the taxon in the Sundaic subregion remains uncertain however as the limited studies to date have been largely based on morphology. The aim of the present study was to determine the taxonomic status of subspecific forms recognized in the subregion and to evaluate phylogeographic distinctiveness between those occurring in Borneo and the Malay Peninsula using genetic, morphological and acoustic datasets. Two forms were confirmed: R. a. nesites from Borneo and R. a. superans from the peninsula. The previous recognition of a population from southernmost Sumatra as R. a. superans was not supported, however, as this form is likely R. a. affinis. Genetic divergence between these three forms is rather deep and is estimated to have occurred during the arid climatic period of the Pleistocene when suitable habitats were reduced to isolated pockets. Our results support the phylogeographic distinctiveness hypothesis as R. affinis sensu lato shows discrete affinities between Borneo and the Malay Peninsula. Discovery of new forms of R. affinis is likely with greater sampling effort throughout the region. Our study also demonstrates the importance of employing multiple datasets in taxonomic evaluations, as the use of morphological and/or acoustic datasets alone could lead to erroneous conclusions.",

The two species were sympatric only at Batang Duri, a village near rainforest.\n              \n              \n                The climate of the study area is characterized by uniformly high temperatures and rainfall, but relatively there are two seasons of more rain and two of less rain. Reproduction of both species is seasonal with continuous bimodal polyoestry. Within each species, the females are in reproductive synchrony, with young born in two distinct seasons (3–4 months each) of parturition 5–7 months apart. Each parturition is followed by postpartum oestrus. For each species, gestation spans about 5–6 or 5–7 months, with embryonic development delayed in the early stages. Births of neither species were timed to the seasons of greater rainfall or to the general season of flowering/fruiting of trees. Instead, births were centred about the two seasons of less rainfall and probably timed to the fruiting of certain species of trees, including mangoes for\n                C. brachyotis.\n              \n              \n                The weight data for\n                C. brachyotis\n                indicated a difference in diet between adult males and females. The bimodal pattern of weight increase/decrease for adult males corresponded to the bimodal cycle of ripened mangoes in Brunei. Although weight increase/decrease for adult females did not correspond to the bimodal cycle of ripened mangoes, none the less the two birthing seasons did, following shortly after or beginning at the two times of abundant ripened mangoes. Similarly, adult males and females of\n                C. minutus\n                appeared to have different diets and/or different foraging patterns.\n              \n              \n                Both sexes of\n                C. minutus\n                (and probably also of\n                C. brachyotis)\n                attain maturity at about 7 months, with females giving birth for the first time at about 12 months. Females conceive shortly upon attaining sexual maturity and are thereafter in states of essentially continuous reproduction with two young born annually (2 litters/yr, 1 neonate/birth). Relative to other fruit bats (Mickleburgh, Hutson & Racey, 1992),\n                C. minutus\n                and\n                C. brachyotis\n                have high rates of reproduction.\n              \n            \n            \n              Summary\n              \n                In summary, the reproductive cycles of\n                C. minutas\n                and\n                C. brachyotis\n                are shown in Fig. 12. Reproduction of both species is seasonal and continuous bimodal polyoestry, however, reproduction of neither species is linked to rains nor the general season of flowering/fruiting of trees.\n              \n              \n                Adult females of both species produce 2 litters/yr, 1 neonate/birth. Within each species, the females are in reproductive synchrony, with young born in two distinct seasons (3–4 months each) of parturition 5–7 months apart, centring about the two seasons of less rain, which may correspond to the fruiting of certain species of trees (e.g. mangoes for\n                C. brachyotis\n                ). Each parturition is followed by postpartum oestrus. Gestation spans about 5–6 months, with embryonic development delayed or arrested in early stages. Both sexes of\n                C. minutas\n                (and probably also\n                C. brachyotis\n                ) attain sexual maturity at about 7 months, with females giving birth the first time at about 12 months.",

The overall base composition was 31.5% A, 26.2% T, 28.3% C, and 14.0% G.

Because these fleas are not known to occur on bats, we hypothesized that the fleasʼ feeding performance (i.e. feeding and digestion rates) would be higher when feeding on their natural host than on either of the bats that they do not naturally parasitize. We found that mass-specific blood-meal size of both male and female fleas was significantly lower when feeding on Kuhlʼs pipistrelles than on the other two species, but was not different in female fleas feeding on fruit bats or on jirds at all stages of digestion. However, more male fleas achieved higher levels of engorgement if they fed on Sundevallʼs jirds than if they fed on Egyptian fruit bats. The fleas digested blood of fruit bats and jirds significantly faster than blood of Kuhlʼs pipistrelle. In addition, after a single blood meal, the survival time of fleas fed on normothermic Kuhlʼs pipistrelles was significantly shorter than that of fleas fed on Sundevallʼs jirds and even lower when male fleas fed on Egyptian fruit bats. Thus, our prediction was partially supported: normothermic Kuhlʼs pipistrelles were inferior hosts for fleas compared with Sandevallʼs jirds and Egyptian fruit bats. Interestingly, the proportion of engorged fleas that fed on torpid Kuhlʼs pipistrelles was significantly higher than the proportion of the fleas that fed on normothermic individuals, indicating that becoming torpid might be a liability, rather than an effective defense against parasites.",

The mitogenome is 17,151 bp in length and is AT-rich with base composition A (27.8%), C (22%), G (16.1%), and T (34.1%). The mitogenome shows conserved gene content and order similar with other mammalian mitogenomes, being composed of 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and one control region. The majority of genes are encoded on the H-Strand except for ND6 and 8 tRNAs as found in other bat species. The field identification of Myotis bechsteinii was confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using datasets comprising whole mitogenomes and COXI. This mitogenome is a resource for future studies of Myotis bats and other mammals.",

However, a wide range of other species has been implicated as reservoirs or dead-end hosts. We conducted a survey for Leptospira spp. in bats and rodents from Papua New Guinea. Kidney samples were collected from 97 pteropodid bats (five species), 37 insectivorous bats from four different families (six species) and 188 rodents (two species). Leptospires were detected in a high proportion of pteropodid bats, including Nyctimene cf. albiventer (35%), Macroglossus minimus (34%) and Rousettus amplexicaudatus (36%). Partial sequencing of the secY gene from rodent and bat leptospires showed host species clustering, with Leptospira interrogans and L. weilii detected in rodents and L. kirschneri and a potential novel species of Leptospira detected in bats. Further research is needed in Papua New Guinea and other locales in the Pacific region to gain a better understanding of the circulation dynamics of leptospires in reservoir species and the risks to public and veterinary health.",

This is the first study to assess variation in size and shape from strictly geometric terms. Both factors are assessed by statistical perspectives of distribution, overlap and relative distances. Despite its overlap, the size of the skull seems to be the most influential character for the discrimination of species, with shape playing a much smaller role. The smallest species seems to be the most distinct in shape, not only in terms of distance among centroids in morphometric space, but also in the overall trend and direction of variation. Contrary to previous studies, sexual dimorphism is not given by size but by distinct shapes of the skull. Characters such as the shape of the maxilla, previously described qualitatively as discrete with sharp boundaries, appear to be truly continuous with fuzzy borders among species. Because morphometric space is a gamut of continuous variation and overlap, the taxonomic error rate for size characters seems to be substantial for the medium-sized species (Carollia brevicauda Schinz, 1821), with approximately 30–40% of individuals erroneously assigned to a different species after a jackknifed discriminant function. This taxonomic error is higher for shape characters. Morphological, systematic and ecological consequences of the observed patterns of shape and size variation are commented within the context of previously proposed arguments and hypotheses.",

This trophic strategy has been documented in two families of bats, Pteropodidae (Old World fruit bats) and Phyllostomidae (New World leaf-nosed bats). Existing folivory hypotheses for bats suggest this behavior provides a dietary supplement of protein and other essential minerals due to a deficiency of these in a frugivorous diet. The Caatinga is a seasonally deciduous tropical dry forest where most of the vegetation is leafless and dormant during the extended dry season. Here we present the first evidence of folivory in bats from the Brazilian Caatinga, with evidence for the phyllostomid Artibeus planirostris ingesting the leaves of at least 16 species of plants. We include a bibliographic review of bat folivory in the tropics. Additionally, we propose a new hypothesis on folivory in bats for this semiarid environment.",

            "abstractNote": "Echolocation allows bats to occupy diverse nocturnal niches. Bats almost always use echolocation, even when other sensory stimuli are available to guide navigation. Here, using arrays of calibrated infrared cameras and ultrasonic microphones, we demonstrate that hoary bats (\n              Lasiurus cinereus\n              ) use previously unknown echolocation behaviours that challenge our current understanding of echolocation. We describe a novel call type (‘micro’ calls) that has three orders of magnitude less sound energy than other bat calls used in open habitats. We also document bats flying close to microphones (less than 3 m) without producing detectable echolocation calls. Acoustic modelling indicates that bats are not producing calls that exceed 70–75 dB at 0.1 m, a level that would have little or no known use for a bat flying in the open at speeds exceeding 7 m s\n              −1\n              . This indicates that hoary bats sometimes fly without echolocation. We speculate that bats reduce echolocation output to avoid eavesdropping by conspecifics during the mating season. These findings might partly explain why tens of thousands of hoary bats are killed by wind turbines each year. They also challenge the long-standing assumption that bats—model organisms for sensory specialization—are reliant on sonar for nocturnal navigation.",

Although the effect of self fertilization on seed ﬁtness in hermaphrodites has been considered theoretically, this effect is far from intuitive, because it can either increase the relative seed ﬁtness of the females (if it leads hermaphrodites to produce inbred, low quality offspring) or decrease it (if it provides reproductive assurance to hermaphrodites). Hence, empirical investigation is needed to document whether relative seed ﬁtness varies with whether pollen is or is not limiting to seed production. In the current study, we measured fruit set and seed production in both females and hermaphrodites and the selﬁng rate in hermaphrodites in two experimental patches that differed in sex ratios in the gynodioecious plant Silene nutans. We found an impact of plant gender, patch, and their interaction, with females suffering from stronger pollen limitation when locally frequent. In the most pollen-limited situation, the selﬁng rate of hermaphrodites increased and provided hermaphrodites with a type of reproductive assurance that is not available to females. By integrating both the beneﬁcial (reproductive assurance) and costly effects (through inbreeding depression) of self-pollination, we showed that whether females did or did not exhibit higher seed ﬁtness depended on the degree of pollen limitation on seed production.",

Therefore, the primary aim of this prospective, exploratory study was to examine whether a systematic cardiac ultrasound protocol is feasible in this critically endangered species and to report basic measures of cardiac structure and function from a cohort of apparently healthy bats. A secondary aim was to test the effect posture (dorsal recumbency vs. roosting) has upon cardiac function in this species. Transthoracic echocardiograms, including 2D, Doppler, and tissue Doppler measures of cardiac structure and function were completed as part of routine health examinations for bats at a single center (n = 19). Bats were then grouped by age and disease status and the mean and range data reported for each group. In healthy adult bats, with the exception of a reduction in heart rate (P ≤ 0.05), right atrial systolic area (P ≤ 0.05), and right ventricular velocity during atrial contraction, there were no signiﬁcant changes in cardiac structure or function in response to the roosting position. However, in the bats presenting with dilated cardiomyopathy the current data suggest that left ventricular ejection fraction is improved while roosting. Further work is required to conﬁrm our initial ﬁndings, generate diagnostic reference intervals, and explore the causes of dilated cardiomyopathy in this species.",

            "abstractNote": "Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasitic protozoan that infects a diversity of hosts constituting the cycle of enzootic transmission in wild environments and causing disease in humans (Chagas disease) and domestic animals. Wild mammals constitute natural reservoirs of this parasite, which is transmitted by hematophagous kissing bugs of the family Reduviidae. T. cruzi is genetically subdivided into six discrete typing units (DTUs), T. cruzi (Tc)I to TcVI. In Brazil, especially in the state of Parana´, TcI and TcII are widely distributed. However, TcII is less frequently found in wild reservoirs and triatomine, and more frequently found in patients. The goal of this study was to investigate the natural occurrence of T. cruzi in wild synanthropic mammals captured in urban forest fragments of the Atlantic Forest of Parana´, southern Brazil. In this way, 12 opossums and 35 bats belonging to ﬁve species were captured in urban forest parks of the city of Maringa´, Parana´, an area considered endemic for Chagas disease. PCR-kinetoplast DNA molecular diagnostic reveals Trypanosoma sp. infection in 12 (100%) Didelphis albiventris and 10 (40%) Artibeus lituratus. In addition to demonstrating the presence of Trypanosoma in the two groups of mammals studied, we obtained an isolate of the parasite genotyped as TcII by ampliﬁcation of the cytochrome oxidase II gene by PCR, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism with AluI, and conﬁrmed by PCR of rDNA 24Sa. This is the ﬁrst record of the encounter in wild mammals of Trypanosoma DNA (in A. lituratus) and T. cruzi DTU TcII (in D. albiventris) in the state of Parana´.",

Pollination is by bees or bats, raising the question of the evolutionary direction and frequency of pollinator shifts. Studies that investigated such shifts in other clades have suggested that bat pollination might be an evolutionary end point.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Methods:\n              Plastid and nuclear DNA sequences were obtained for 50 accessions representing 30 species of\n              Cayaponia\n              and close relatives, and analyses were carried out to test monophyly, infer divergence times, and reconstruct ancestral states for habitat preferences and pollination modes.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Key results:\n              The phylogeny shows that\n              Cayaponia\n              is monophyletic as long as\n              Selysia\n              (a genus with four species from Central and South America) is included. The required nomenclatural transfers are made in this paper. African and Madagascan accessions of\n              C. africana\n              form a clade that is part of a polytomy with Caribbean and South American species, and the inferred divergence time of 2–5 Ma implies a transoceanic dispersal event from the New World to Africa. The ancestral state reconstructions suggest that\n              Cayaponia\n              originated in tropical forests from where open savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to savanna habitats.\n            \n            \n              •\n              Conclusions: Cayaponia\n              provides the first example of evolutionary transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa.",

            "abstractNote": "Variations in environmental conditions along gradients play an important role in species distribution through environmental filtering of morphological and physiological traits; however, their effects on bat diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effect of the distance to the nearest watercourse, terrain elevation, vegetation clutter, basal area and canopy height on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and on the predominance of some functional traits (body mass, wing morphology and trophic level) of bat assemblages (phyllostomid and mormoopid bats) in a terra firme forest, in the northeastern Brazilian Amazon. We captured bats using mist nets in 15 permanent plots over a 25 km2 area of continuous forest. We captured 279 individuals belonging to 28 species with a total of 77.760 m2.h of sampling effort. Our results showed that bat richness increases as a function of distance to the nearest watercourse and that the assemblage also changes, with more diverse taxonomic and functional groups in areas further from the watercourse. Furthermore, elevation positively affects species richness, and the basal area of the forest positively influences the average body mass of bats. Taken together, our results demonstrate that subtle variations in the environmental conditions along a local scale gradient impact on the main dimensions of bat diversity in primary forests.",

Such descriptions usually lack observations on social behaviour including interactions between bats with aberrant pigmentation and other individuals. Here, we report the ﬁrst observation of leucism in the greater sac-winged bat Saccopteryx bilineata. Over the course of six weeks, we were able to follow the development of a wild pup with a conspicuous aberrant pigmentation, by observing it in its day roost. Our observations indicate that the vocal and behavioural development of the pup was entirely normal, as well as the integration into its social group. After six weeks, when the pup was already foraging individually, it did not return to its colony in the morning, indicating that it may have been preyed on.",

We report the occurrence of Nyctinomops aurispinosus in Central America based on a recently dead male found in southern Honduras. The nearest localities where it has been reported are western Sonora and eastern Tamaulipas, México. The specimen was found at 1,239 masl on December 5th, 2014 in a disturbed oak-pine forest used for cattle ranching with some human infrastructure recently built in the site. We have registered several other species of bats in this study site, including N. laticaudatus, Eumops underwoodi, four vespertilionids and three mormoopids, most of them difficult to catch by mist nets. We add a new bat species to the Honduras list which now stands at 108 species.",

Here, we performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis of evidence of Leptospira sp. infection in bats by examining studies published between 1964 and 2021. We reported the frequencies of various species and serogroups on all continents, several species and feeding habits of bats, and different diagnostic tools. Together, 33 papers from all continents with seven to 2077 individuals from one to 31 species were included. Molecular detection was conducted in most studies, followed by MAT (Microscopic Agglutination Test) and isolation and identification. Molecular characterization of Leptospira sp. revealed L. borgpetersenii as the most frequent species. Moreover, 179 positive samples for MAT contained the most likely infecting serogroups described, particularly the Australis serogroup. The percentage of positive tests in isolation and identification ranged between 0% and 0.5%. The highest frequency of Leptospira infection among the continents was observed in Asia, whereas South America had the lowest percentage. Finally, Nycteridae and Rhinonycteridae were the most frequently infected bat families. Our study provides valuable information about the epidemiology of Leptospira sp. infection in bats.",

In an attempt to address some of the conservation challenges faced by this species, we studied the genetic structure and dispersal of intra‐ and interisland populations using six species‐specific microsatellite markers. In particular, we sought to establish the relationship between island populations and to define effective management units for conservation. Pairwise co‐ancestry index (\n              F\n              ST\n              ) analysis, analysis of molecular variance, and Bayesian clustering suggested the presence of significant genetic differentiation between islands but little differentiation within them. The small Yonaguni Island population appeared to be not only geographically isolated, but also genetically isolated. This population is at the greatest risk of extinction, considering its size and low genetic variation. The larger populations on Iriomote and Ishigaki Islands are genetically related to each other to a greater degree and exhibit higher genetic variation than the Yonaguni Island population. This suggests that these two island populations should be included in a single management unit, while bats from Yonaguni Island should be managed independently and given higher priority for conservation. Actions such as defining vegetation corridors between colonies, as well as building gates at the entrance of the largest known colony, should be included in the conservation agenda of this still poorly known species.",

Specifically, we hypothesized that conspecific distress calls broadcast within or in proximity to the day-roost would elicit a stronger responsiveness than distress calls broadcast at a foraging site. We analysed the distress calls and conducted playback experiments with the greater sac-winged bat,\n              Saccopteryx bilineata\n              , which occupies perennial day-roosts with a stable social group composition.\n              S. bilineata\n              reacted significantly differently depending on the playback's location. Bats were attracted to distress call playbacks within the day-roost and in proximity to it, but showed no obvious response to distress call playbacks at a foraging site. Hence, the bats adapted their responsiveness towards distress calls depending on the social relevance in which distress calls were broadcast. Distress calls within or in proximity to the day-roost are probably perceived as a greater threat and thus have a higher behavioural relevance than distress calls at foraging sites, either because bats want to assess the predation risk or because they engage in mobbing behaviour.",

The signal transduction pathways and transcription factors involved in regulating hibernation‐responsive gene expression are of great interest. The present study suggests an important role for the p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase (p38\n              MAPK\n              ) and selected downstream transcription factors under its control (CREB, ATF‐2, Elk‐1) in the metabolic response by skeletal muscle during hibernation of little brown bats,\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              . Western blotting was used to quantify both total protein and levels of the phosphorylated, active forms of p38\n              MAPK\n              , CREB, ATF‐2 and Elk‐1 in both skeletal muscle and heart of euthermic and hibernating bats. The p38\n              MAPK\n              pathway was not apparently activated in heart during torpor but skeletal muscle showed strong increases (2.2–11‐fold) in the amounts of phosphorylated p38\n              T180/Y182\n              , CREB\n              S133\n              , ATF‐\n              2T69/71\n              and Elk‐1\n              S383\n              in the torpid versus aroused state. By contrast both total and phosphorylated levels of Elk‐1 in heart were reduced during hibernation to just 30% of the euthermic values. These data implicate p38\n              MAPK\n              and its transcription factor targets, CREB, ATF‐2 and Elk‐1 in skeletal muscle maintenance during hibernation.

            "abstractNote": "Ex situ (captive) management can facilitate species recovery, but this approach is invasive and is not universally appropriate. Evidence-based approaches are critical to determining whether ex situ approaches will be effective, but in many cases biological and ecological data from threatened populations are scarce. We generated a structured set of general biological and social/logistical criteria required for captive management to beneﬁt threatened, free-ranging populations. We illustrate how these criteria can be applied using a case study where populations are severely threatened, but demographic data are scarce (white-nose syndrome in Canadian bats). Using (1) population viability modelling (PVA), (2) a survey of Canadian zoos and wildlife rehabilitators, and (3) literature reviews, we identiﬁed two of our ﬁve initial target species as potential candidates for captive management. PVA revealed that sustainable captive colonies require high adult survivorship relative to free-ranging populations. Our survey and literature reviews showed that Canadian zoos and wildlife rehabilitators are enthusiastic about bat conservation. However, none could currently maintain the target species, due to limited infrastructure and/ or knowledge gaps related to husbandry and reintroduction of captive bats to the wild. Captive management is unlikely to stabilize target populations because released bats risk re-infection. We conclude that ex situ management is not an appropriate tool in our case study, and would represent ineffective use of available conservation resources. However, development of captive husbandry and re-introduction methods for hibernating, insectivorous bats would contribute to our global capacity to conserve similar species.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Mitigation of emerging infectious diseases that threaten global biodiversity requires an understanding of critical host and pathogen responses to infection. For multihost pathogens where pathogen virulence or host susceptibility is variable, host–pathogen interactions in tolerant species may identify potential avenues for adaptive evolution in recently exposed, susceptible hosts. For example, the fungus\n              Pseudogymnoascus destructans\n              causes white‐nose syndrome (\n              WNS\n              ) in hibernating bats and is responsible for catastrophic declines in some species in North America, where it was recently introduced. Bats in Europe and Asia, where the pathogen is endemic, are only mildly affected. Different environmental conditions among Nearctic and Palearctic hibernacula have been proposed as an explanation for variable disease outcomes, but this hypothesis has not been experimentally tested. We report the first controlled, experimental investigation of response to\n              P. destructans\n              in a tolerant, European species of bat (the greater mouse‐eared bat,\n              Myotis myotis\n              ). We compared body condition, disease outcomes and gene expression in control (sham‐exposed) and exposed\n              M. myotis\n              that hibernated under controlled environmental conditions following treatment. Tolerant\n              M. myotis\n              experienced extremely limited fungal growth and did not exhibit symptoms of\n              WNS\n              . However, we detected no differential expression of genes associated with immune response in exposed bats, indicating that immune response does not drive tolerance of\n              P. destructans\n              in late hibernation. Variable responses to\n              P. destructans\n              among bat species cannot be attributed solely to environmental or ecological factors. Instead, our results implicate coevolution with the pathogen, and highlight the dynamic nature of the “white‐nose syndrome transcriptome.” Interspecific variation in response to exposure by the host (and possibly pathogen) emphasizes the importance of context in studies of the bat‐\n              WNS\n              system, and robust characterization of genetic responses to exposure in various hosts and the pathogen should precede any attempts to use particular bat species as generalizable “model hosts.”",

The mechanisms by which mother bats recognize their pups and adult bats recognize each other are not clear. We hypothesized that such recognition is achieved by chemical discrimination and performed experiments to test the hypothesis. Results showed that mother bats were much more attracted to the scent from their own pups. For adult bats, females were attracted to the scent from both male and female groupmates but had a higher preference to the scent from female than from male groupmates. Male bats were much more attracted to the scent from male groupmates while showed no preference to the scent from female groupmates. Within a group, both female and male bats had no difference in preference to the scent from the same or opposite sex. These results suggest that mother–­pup and groupmate recognition of T. pachypus can be achieved by olfactory cues.",

            "abstractNote": "Although bats have been implicated as reservoir hosts for a number of zoonotic and life-threatening viruses, the bat bacterial ﬂora and its zoonotic threat remain elusive. However, members of the vector-borne bacterial genera Bartonella causing various human as well as animal diseases have recently been isolated or detected from bats and their ectoparasites. In this study, we sampled 124 insectivorous microbats (Daubenton’s bat, Myotis daubentonii) for peripheral blood in southwestern Finland in 2010. A Bartonella-speciﬁc PCR targeting rpoB (RNA polymerase b-subunit) was positive with blood samples from 46 bats (prevalence 37%). Scaled mass indexes of the infected and noninfected bats did not differ ( p = 0.057). One rpoB sequence was identical with the rpoB sequence of B. naantaliensis strain 2574/1, previously isolated from bats in Finland. The rest of the sequences were highly similar to each other with nucleotide identity scores of 96% or higher. Nucleotide identity scores to the previously described type strain sequences of Bartonella or other database entries were no higher than 87%. Sequence analyses of another gene, gltA (citrate synthase), gave no higher than 90% nucleotide identity scores. On the basis of the conventional 95% sequence similarity cutoff in bacterial species delineation, a novel species of Bartonella was detected. We propose a species name Candidatus B. hemsundetiensis. Phylogenetic analyses based on rpoB and gltA sequences indicate that Candidatus B. hemsundetiensis clusters in a deep-branching position close to the ancestral species B. tamiae and B. bacilliformis. Our study reinforces the importance of bats as reservoirs of Bartonella.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats may exhibit plasticity in echolocation pulses as response to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and the estimation of the magnitude of such variation can provide confidence in acoustic monitoring. Myotis nigricans (Schinz, 1821) is a widely distributed but relatively understudied Neotropical species for which, during fieldwork, we found maternity colonies in the Lagunas de Montebello National Park, in Chiapas, South-east Mexico, and no previous information in the area. Therefore, we aimed to provide an acoustic characterization on the basis of intraspecific variability for its recognition using bat detectors. For this purpose, we examined the moulding of shape, frequency-based and time-based acoustic parameters, specifically by the effect of age group (sub-adults vs. adults) and acoustic environment (open space vs. background vegetation). By graphic comparison of echolocation pulses between acoustic environments, we observed changes in shape by an increase in bandwidth and steeper modulation along background vegetation. Statistically, on univariate basis, we did not find a significant effect of age group, but we did of acoustic environment, specifically on highest frequency (higher average), duration (shorter average) and interpulse interval (shorter average) along background vegetation. On multivariate basis, we confirmed shorter average interpulse interval along background vegetation. The overall classification accuracy was relatively high (82.22%): 80% in open space and 84% along background vegetation. Our work reinforces previous knowledge about sound constraints imposed by vegetation clutter, and provides a reliable framework for acoustic monitoring of this species across structurally variable, and hence acoustically variable, environments in the area.",

We asked whether the patterns of zeta diversity differ between (a) infracommunities and component communities; (b) ecto- and endoparasites and (c) subsets of communities infecting male and female bats. The pattern of compositional turnover differed between infracommunities and component communities in endoparasites only. The shape of zeta decline for infracommunities indicated that there were approximately equal probabilities of ecto- and endoparasitic species to occur on/in any bat individual within a site. The shape of zeta decline for component communities suggested the stochasticity of ectoparasite turnover, whereas the turnover of endoparasites was driven by niche-based processes. Compositional turnover in component communities of ectoparasites was more spatially dependent than that of endoparasites. Spatial independence of compositional turnover in endoparasites was due to subcommunities harboured by female bats. We conclude that the patterns of compositional turnover in infracommunities were similar in ecto- and endoparasites, whereas the patterns of turnover in component communities differed between these groups.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are well known for species richness and ecological diversity, and thus, they provide a good opportunity to study relationships and interaction between species. To assess interactions, we consider distinct traits that are probably to be triggered by niche shape and evolutionary processes. We present data on the trophic niche differentiation between two sympatric European trawling bat species, Myotis dasycneme and Myotis daubentonii, incorporating a wide spectrum of methodological approaches. We measure morphological traits involved in foraging and prey handling performance including bite force, weightlifting capacity and wing morphology. We then measure resulting prey consumption using both morphological and molecular diet analyses. These species closely resemble each other in morphological traits, however, subtle but signiﬁcant differences were apparent in bite force and lift capacity, which are related to differences in basic body and head size. Both morphological and molecular diet analyses show strong niche overlap. We detected subtle differences in less frequent prey items, as well as differences in the exploitation of terrestrial and aquatic-based prey groups. Myotis dasycneme feeds more on aquatic prey, like Chironomidae and their pupal stages, or on the aquatic moth Acentria ephemerella. Myotis daubentonii feeds more on terrestrial prey, like Brachycera, or Coleoptera. This suggests that these bats use different microhabitats within the habitat where they co-occur.",

Considered a species of conservation concern throughout much of its range, protection efforts would greatly benefit from understanding patterns of population structure, genetic diversity, and local adaptation. To facilitate such research, we present the first de novo genome assembly of C. townsendii as part of the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP). Pacific Biosciences HiFi long reads and Omni-C chromatin-proximity sequencing technologies were used to produce a de novo genome assembly, consistent with the standard CCGP reference genome protocol. This assembly comprises 391 scaffolds spanning 2.1 Gb, represented by a scaffold N50 of 174.6 Mb, a contig N50 of 23.4 Mb, and a benchmarking universal single-copy ortholog (BUSCO) completeness score of 96.6%. This high-quality genome will be a key tool for informed conservation and management of this vulnerable species in California and across its range.",

            "abstractNote": "Feeding of tawny owl, Strix aluco, was studied from 14 localities of northern and central Italy, where it preyed mainly upon mammals and birds, but amphibians and invertebrates were also frequently eaten. Predation upon mammals was more important from autumn to spring, when alternative prey (amphibians, birds and invertebrates) were less available. The food niche overlaps, the linear distances (in km) between the various localities were negatively correlated, and the mean size of prey taken increased with the proportion of forested territory. However, where tawny owl preyed upon large forest mammals, it also preyed upon larger mammals not typical of forests. Considering the relationships between forest structure and tawny owl diet, it was found that forest density was positively correlated with the proportion of arvicolids and negatively with prey size diversity and the proportion of myoxids. The amount of forest territory within 1 km radius from each pellet collection site largely explained diet variability. Results of discriminant analysis, in addition, suggested that tawny owl is likely to avoid thick Mediterranean coppice forests as hunting habitats.",

The C. brachyotis roosts were distributed between 600–1,500 m. Day roosts were found at an elevation of about 1,000m in Sirumalai and Yercaud Hill stations. Mist-netting studies, however, revealed that C. brachyotis was widely distributed at different elevations ranging from 600–1,500 m. Moreover, through a radio-telemetry study, we determined that the males foraged at shorter distances from the day roost, whereas the females commuted longer distances and used more than one foraging area. The male bats’ time of emergence is significantly less than females; in addition, males frequently return to their day-roost and made several short foraging flights spaced randomly throughout the night. These observations suggest that some type of territoriality is associated with their roost, which appears to be the basis of social organization in C. brachyotis. Overall, this study provides detailed information about the foraging and roosting ecology of C. brachyotis in southern India.",

            "abstractNote": "Owls prey on bats, but information on owl predation is scarce, its impact on bat mortality is unclear, and reports on behavioural responses, including roost-switching and fission–fusion behaviour, are equivocal. To study the link between owl predation and anti-predator behaviour in bats, we evaluated seven months of video recordings at roosts and the behaviour of 51 passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tagged bats and bats without tags in a geographically isolated colony of greater noctule bats (\n              Nyctalus lasiopterus\n              ) in Spain. We found the tawny owl\n              Strix aluco\n              to almost continuously hunt\n              N. lasiopterus\n              , from perches and on the wing, well after the bats emerged at dusk and when they returned to their roosts. We recorded 39 unsuccessful and three successful attacks. Nonetheless, we found no evidence that owl predation modifies bat behaviour. While the bats constituted only a very small proportion of the owls' diet, owl predation accounted for an estimated 30–40% of bat mortality, which may have a significant impact on small, local or isolated bat populations, in particular, and thereby shape regional bat distributions. We hypothesize that low roost availability may also affect the bats’ potential response to predation, which could lead to natural predation having an excessive impact on bat populations.",

            "abstractNote": "Grooming is a common behavior of some mammals. Previous studies have shown that grooming is a means by which animals clean themselves, remove ectoparasites, and lower their body temperature. It is also involved in olfactory communication. Bats belong to the order Chiroptera and, like most mammals, are the natural host of many ectoparasites. Bat grooming, including licking and scratching, is one of the ways to reduce the adverse effects caused by ectoparasites. Bat grooming may also be induced by exogenous odor. In this study, we used lesser flat‐headed bats (Tylonycteris pachypus) to test the hypothesis that exogenous odor affects the self‐grooming behavior of bats. Results showed that external odor from distantly related species caused lesser flat‐headed bats to spend more time in self‐grooming. Lesser flat‐headed bats that received odor from humans spent the longest time in self‐grooming, followed by those that received odor from a different species of bats (T. robustula). Lesser flatheaded bats that received odor form the same species of bats, either from the same or a different colony, spent the least amount of time in self‐grooming. These results suggest that bats can recognize conspecific and heterospecific through body scent.",

Statistical analysis of sonar calls provides evidence that variation carries social information about a caller, including individual identity. We hypothesized that little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) would be able to recognize individuals given the potential ﬁtness beneﬁts of doing so. We performed playback trials using a habituation-discrimination design to determine whether little brown bats are able to recognize the individual identity of a caller based on variation in their sonar calls. Each subject bat was played the calls of bat A until they habituated (deﬁned as a 50% decrease from the beginning call rate), then the calls of bat B or a new call sequence of bat A (a control, referred to as bat A’) were played. Each subject received a unique pair of playback recordings (bat A and B) from adult female bats from the same colony (but a different colony from the subject) and the order of trials was randomized. The response measures were habituation time (s) and call rate (calls ⁄ s). Within a trial, subjects habituated to calls of bat A and transferred this habituation to the bat A’ sequence. In addition, they increased their call rates when played calls of bat B. Comparing between trials, subjects increased their call rate to the calls of bat B to a greater relative extent than to the calls of bat A’. These results provide the ﬁrst evidence that bats recognize individual identity of conspeciﬁcs (as opposed to discrimination of groups), which has implications for the social interactions of bats.",

If variation in call features reliably reﬂects characteristics of individuals, then there is potential for information transfer to conspeciﬁcs. Thus, sonar calls, in addition to their use in orientation and prey location, may function for communication. We obtained recordings of sonar calls from 66 little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) captured from buildings at Chautauqua Institution, State University of New York at Fredonia campus, and surrounding areas in 2003–2005. Calls were recorded using a laptop computer, digitizing card, connector box, ampliﬁer, and U30 bat detector while the bat crawled from hand to hand and while in ﬂight. Calls were extracted and analyzed using custom computer programs to generate measurements for variables describing each call, which were then analyzed statistically. Our analysis revealed individual identity, state of lactation, and age category are reliably indicated by call variation of crawling bats, and individual identity information is contained in calls of bats in ﬂight. To our knowledge these results are the 1st report of differences between sonar calls of lactating and nonlactating individuals for any bat species and individual differences in sonar calls for M. lucifugus. Individual identity information is available in calls produced within a situation; however, this information does not transfer well to the calls of the same bats produced in different situations. Our results suggest that the potential for communication of information via sonar calls depends on calling situation.",

The bats were trained to localize pure tones throughout most of their hearing range from loudspeakers located 30° to the left and right of midline. Both species easily localized high frequency tones, indicating they could use the interaural intensity difference cue. However, neither was able to localize low frequency tones even when the tones were amplitude modulated thereby indicating that they could not use ongoing phase difference cues. The authors now know of eight mammals that do not use binaural phase cues for localization, and some possible reasons for this inability are explored.",

In contrast, in climatically less seasonal habitats, reproductive timing may be determined by a wide variety of seasonal factors. Three hypotheses regarding reproductive timing were tested for a fruit bat, Huplonycteris Jischeri Lawrence, by comparing reproductive timing and climate at four moderately seasonal Philippine sites with differing climates. Bats were sampled in five years on Negros Island (9″22′N, 123″l I'E), and in one to four months on four other islands. Flower and fruit abundance was monitored in two years on Negros. In five years on Negros, parturition and lactation coincided with the time of the average dry‐wet season transition and early wct season, but did not vary in response to substantial annual variation in the onset of rains. Reproductive timing did not change in response to annual variations in Rower or fruit abundance; lactation coincided with a peak in fruit abundance in one year, but not in a second, and reproductive success appeared to be reduced when lactation coincided with scarce resources. At a second site with a different pattern of rainfall, reproduction was nevertheless synchronous with Negros. Samples from two of the three remaining localities indicate a two‐ to three‐month lag in reproductive events relative to Negros, despite rainfall patterns remarkably similar to that of Negros. All three hypotheses for reproductive timing were rejected. As an alternative, Huplonycteris may evolve timing patterns in response to local seasonal patterns of resource abundance.\n            Huplonycteris has an eight‐month post‐implantation delay 'in embryonic development. Six hypotheses on the adaptive significance of this delay in Huplonyrferis were evaluated. Three were rejected, but the data were consistent with the remaining hypotheses: (1) The delay sets the time of parturition at a particular time of year; (2) the delay allows all females to produce young relatively synchronously; and (3) the delay allows females to resorb or abort defective embryos without losing an opportunity for reproduction.",

To provide insights on this species’ day-roosting habits, we successfully radiotracked 5 lactating females and 5 non-reproductive males to 57 day-roosts during June and July 2008. Eastern Small-footed Myotis used ground-level rock roosts in talus slopes and rock ﬁelds (n = 53), and roosts in vertical cliff faces (n = 4). Ground-level roosts had low canopy cover (males: xࣛ = 14.1 ± 2.1 [SE] %, females: xࣛ = 19.6 ± 3.1%), but were located close to vegetation (males: xࣛ = 3.6 ± 0.4 m, females: xࣛ = 4.8 ± 0.8 m). Males switched roosts every 1.1 ± 0.04 days, traveled 41.2 ± 7.8 m between consecutive roosts, and roosted 415 ± 49.0 m from capture locations. Females switched roosts every 1.1 ± 0.06 days, traveled 66.5 ± 14.6 m between consecutive roosts, and roosted 368 ± 24.0 m from capture locations. Ground-level roosts used by females were closer to ephemeral water sources (xࣛ = 226 ± 31.2 m, n = 25) than those used by males (xࣛ = 458 ± 16.7 m, n = 28; W = 401, P < 0.01). These data illustrate the importance of rock habitat with high solar exposure near protective cover and water in day-roost selection by Eastern Small-footed Myotis.",

The long-term viability of vulnerable species requires recognition of critical habitats, including those also occupied by humans. Our study aimed to quantify the importance of buildings to little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus) in Yellowstone National Park, a high-elevation landscape with relatively few human structures and abundant alternative roosting habitat. We measured roost preferences and thermoregulation in adult male and female bats roosting in buildings, trees, and rocks using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. We also studied microclimates within each roost type for comparison to roost preferences. We found reproductive females roosting in building attics on 84% of all possible days, while males roosted exclusively in rock crevices or in trees. This dichotomous roosting pattern reﬂected differences in roost microclimates. All roost types buffered bats from daily minimum ambient temperatures; however, buildings were more insulated from low ambient temperatures during the middle of the maternity season. Male bats roosting in rocks and trees predominantly thermoconformed to roost temperatures, while females roosting in buildings sustained higher body temperatures than males throughout the day. Pregnant and lactating females also used torpor frequently, with skin temperatures reaching <10°C, and a gestation period lasting 49–89 d. These results show that cool summer temperatures at high elevations present an energetic challenge to little brown myotis. Buildings provide critical habitat for reproductive females and likely allow for larger populations than would be possible in their absence, making these roosts a priority for long-term conservation of this declining species.",

The fuel strategies used by migrating bats are not well understood and have not been investigated during the spring when insectivorous bats face low food abundance. Migrating silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans (Le Conte, 1831)) were captured at a stopover site in Long Point, Ontario, Canada, in April and May of 2012–2014. We followed the movements of 40 bats outﬁtted with radio transmitters using an automated telemetry array and examined the effects of ambient temperature, fat stores, and sex on stopover duration. As seen previously in autumn, most bats departed the evening following capture, but one-third of bats used multiday stopovers. Extended stopover was associated with lower ambient temperature. There was no effect of sex or fat at capture on stopover departure probability. Bats captured closer to dawn had greater fat mass and lean mass than those captured early in the night, a trend indicative of fuel deposition at this site. This is the ﬁrst study to provide evidence that bats use stopover habitat for refuelling.",

Unusual among bats, it is well adapted for the capture of prey on the ground. Bats from Fiordland, New Zealand had relatively low wing loadings and aspect ratios adapted for ﬂight in cluttered habitats. We predicted that M. tuberculata would locate prey in air (uncluttered space) by echolocation. Echolocation call sequences associated with prey capture (terminal buzzes) were heard in the ﬁeld, and bats detected and localized prey suspended on ﬁshing line by echolocation in a ﬂight cage. The bats emitted brief, multiharmonic echolocation calls at low duty cycle during search phase, and 64% of calls contained most energy in the fundamental harmonic. Approach- and terminalphase calls were also broadband and multiharmonic. We predicted that bats would not use echolocation to locate prey hidden on the ground in leaf litter (cluttered space). Bats seemed unable to locate hidden prey precisely from the air and instead hunted for such prey while crawling. Echolocation calls were emitted at a low repetition rate on the ground, suggesting that here echolocation was used for orientation and not for prey detection. We experimentally removed cues available to the bats and showed that bats located mealworms in leaf litter by listening for preygenerated noises and possibly by olfaction.",

            "abstractNote": "A revelation of the genomic age has been the contributions of the mobile DNA segments called transposable elements to chromosome structure, function, and evolution in virtually all organisms. Substantial fractions of vertebrate genomes derive from transposable elements, being dominated by retroelements that move via RNA intermediates. Although many of these elements have been inactivated by mutation, several active retroelements remain. Vertebrate genomes also contain substantial quantities and a high diversity of cut-and-paste DNA transposons, but no active representative of this class has been identified in mammals. Here we show that a cut-and-paste element called\n              piggyBat,\n              which has recently invaded the genome of the little brown bat (\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              ) and is a member of the\n              piggyBac\n              superfamily, is active in its native form in transposition assays in bat and human cultured cells, as well as in the yeast\n              Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n              . Our study suggests that some DNA transposons are still actively shaping some mammalian genomes and reveals an unprecedented opportunity to study the mechanism, regulation, and genomic impact of cut-and-paste transposition in a natural mammalian host.",

            "abstractNote": "As a K-strategist and comparatively sedentary species, the lesser horseshoe bat Rhinolophus hipposideros is considered sensitive to changes in habitat quality. Knowledge of the species’ dietary requirements and use of foraging habitats is thus considered an essential prerequisite to manage its habitats adequately. Based on four large annual samples of faecal pellets from three different nursery colonies, including two consecutive years of sampling from one colony, we studied the diet of Central German populations of R. hipposideros. Consistent with findings of similar studies carried out in other parts of the distribution range of R. hipposideros, in our study, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Neuroptera represented the most important groups of prey for the studied colonies. However, Hemiptera made a comparatively larger contribution in our study than in others, and so did Hymenoptera in one of the colonies. We found seasonal compositional variation in all four annual samples, as well as compositional variation between samples from different colonies, but not between the two annual samples obtained in consecutive years from the same colony. Differences between colonies appeared at least to some extent to reflect differences in availability of foraging habitats. Our results are thus in agreement with the assumption of R. hipposideros being a largely opportunistic, generalist forager. Our findings are also consistent with a known preference by R. hipposideros of woodland as main foraging habitat, as previously established by other studies carried out in the northern part of the distribution range. However, the relative importance of Hemiptera, and in particular of Psyllidae, at certain times during the foraging season, suggests that the Central German colonies of R. hipposideros might have utilized commercial orchards and private fruit gardens for foraging during seasonal peaks in abundance of pest species of fruit trees. The implied ability of R. hipposideros to respond to seasonal abundance peaks of particular groups of prey in a range of habitats suggests that structural diversity might be key in maintaining viable populations of this species. The potential importance of orchards and fruit gardens in regions where such habitats are prevalent is likely to have relevant management implications.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats emit a series of echolocation calls with an increasing repetition rate (the terminal buzz) when attempting to capture prey. This is often used as an acoustic indicator of prey-capture attempts. However, because it is directly linked to foraging efficiency, predation success is a more useful measure than predation attempts in ecological research. The characteristics of echolocation calls that consistently signify predation success across different situations have not been identified. Owing to additional influencing factors, identification of these characteristics is particularly challenging for wild bats foraging in their natural environment compared with those in flight chambers. This study documented the natural foraging behavior of wild Japanese large-footed bats (Myotis macrodactylus) using synchronized acoustic and video recordings. From the video recordings, we could assign 137 attacks to three outcome categories: prey captured (51.8%), prey dropped (29.2%) and failed attempt (19%). Based on previous indications from laboratory studies that the length of the silent interval following the terminal buzz ( postbuzz pause) might reflect the prey-capture outcome, we compared post-buzz pause durations among categories of attack outcomes. The post-buzz pause was longest in the case of successful capture, suggesting that the length of the post-buzz pause is a useful acoustic indicator of predation success during natural foraging in M. macrodactylus. Our finding will advance the study of bat foraging behavior using acoustic data, including estimations of foraging efficiency and analyses of feeding habitat quality.",

We studied diet of the intermediate horseshoe bat, Rhinolophus affinis, and the temporal variations in prey resource use. We also measured prey availability in order to explore whether this species is a generalist or specialist feeder. A total of 665 fecal samples were collected from 133 captured individuals from January to December 2019 in a tropical rainforest of Penang Island (Malaysia). A descriptive analysis of samples revealed a total of eight insect prey orders. The main taxon was Coleoptera (Percent Volume >50%), followed by Isoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera, respectively (5–15%). Neuroptera and Psocoptera were occasionally found in the samples (each <1%). This result exhibits a degree of dietary specialization on coleopterans although the diet composition was flexible and significantly varied over time (among months and within nights). Based on light trapping, Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera were frequent insects in the study area, while Isoptera was seasonally abundant. The correlation between variation in the diet and light trap for each prey taxon was mostly not statistically significant, suggesting that R. affinis do not consume prey in proportion to abundance and alternatively may discriminate between prey items when foraging and take prey in rank order. Given this, we further investigated the heavy consumption of absolute abundance of Coleoptera (high-ranking prey in diet). As a result, coleopterans were included in the diet regardless of the abundance of other prey showing a pattern of dietary specialization.",

Here we tested two predictions of the nichespecific cognitive strategies hypothesis in bats, which suggests that predatory species should rely more on object memory than on spatial memory for finding food and that the opposite is true of frugivorous and nectivorous species. Specifically, we predicted that: (1) predatory bats would readily learn to associate shapes with palatable prey and (2) once bats had made such associations, these would interfere with their subsequent learning of a spatial memory task. We trained freeflying Myotis nattereri to approach palatable and unpalatable insect prey suspended below polystyrene objects. Experimentally naïve bats learned to associate different objects with palatable and unpalatable prey but performed no better than chance in a subsequent spatial memory experiment. Because experimental sequence was predicted to be of consequence, we introduced a second group of bats first to the spatial memory experiment. These bats learned to associate prey position with palatability. Control trials indicated that bats made their decisions based on information acquired through echolocation. Previous studies have shown that bat species that eat mainly nectar and fruit rely heavily on spatial memory, reflecting the relative consistency of distribution of fruit and nectar compared with insects. Our results support the niche-specific cognitive strategies hypothesis and suggest that for gleaning and clutter-resistant aerial hawking bats, learning to associate shape with food interferes with subsequent spatial memory learning.",

As currently understood Gardnerycteris is formed by two species, G. crenulatum and G. koepckeae. However, it has been hypothesized that G. crenulatum might be a complex of species, from which the form G. c. keenani exhibits the clearest morphological differences from other populations of ‘crenulatum’. Species limits and relationships among forms of Gardnerycteris have been only partially explored on the basis of morphological variation. Herein, we obtained partial sequences of two mitochondrial genes (cytb and COX1) and one nuclear gene (RAG2) from representatives of G. koepckeae and G. c. keenani in order to clarify the relationships within the genus. Furthermore, we performed qualitative and quantitative morphological comparisons among G. crenulatum sensu stricto, G. c. keenani, and G. koepckeae to limit species. Our results support the monophyly of Gardnerycteris, as well as the molecular and morphological differentiation of G. c. keenani from other congeners. In the light of the results, we propose changes in the taxonomy of the genus, raising ‘keenani’ to the species level.",

The sequences were obtained from the four individuals and composition of nucleotide AT and GC was about 64.58% and 35.42%, respectively. The lengths of mitogenomes were ranged from 17 296 to 17 299 bp. Total 51 variable sites were observed in the four mitogenomes and 38 sites were singleton polymorphic sites. Phylogenic study revealed that the species would have relatively closed evolutionary distance with m. macrodactylus rather than other species in the genus, myotis. Present study will provide important genomic materials supporting confirmation of taxon of species called bats, which is included in one of the largest orders among the mammals.",

However, little is known about how these viruses interact with their natural hosts. We demonstrate a Betacoronavirus (subgenus Merbecovirus), PN-bCoV, in the intestine of its natural host, Nathusius’s Pipistrelle Bat (Pipistrellus nathusii), by combining molecular and microscopy techniques. Eighty-eight P. nathusii bat carcasses were tested for PN-bCoV RNA by RT-qPCR, of which 25 bats (28%) tested positive. PN-bCoV RNA was more often detected in samples of the intestinal tract than in other sample types. In addition, viral RNA loads were higher in intestinal samples compared to other sample types, both on average and in each individual bat. In one bat, we demonstrated Merbecovirus antigen and PN-bCoV RNA expression in intestinal epithelium and the underlying connective tissue using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, respectively. These results indicate that PN-bCoV has a tropism for the intestinal epithelium of its natural host, Nathusius’s Pipistrelle Bat, and imply that the fecal-oral route is a possible route of transmission.",

This has important conservation implications, particularly for range-restricted species in tropical regions. In this study, we provide new insight into the distribution and ecology of one such species, the Nimba otter-shrew (Micropotamogale lamottei Heim de Balsac 1954). We apply niche and occupancy modeling to inform on the range and habitat use of this semi-aquatic species. We estimate that its global range [extent of occurrence (EOO)] is 14,725 km2. Using occupancy modeling, we show that mining has a direct impact on the occurrence of this species. We also provide preliminary observations of its movements through radio-tracking. Using maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling, we identify the North Lorma National Forest and the Wonegizi range (northern Liberia) that appear suitable for this species, but where it has not yet been recorded. We suggest that the Nimba otter-shrew has a global distribution centered on the Mount Nimba region, straddling the borders of Liberia, Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire, and that it requires urgent conservation attention to ensure its long-term persistence. Finally, we provide evidence to support an uplisting of its IUCN Red List conservation status to Vulnerable.",

The effects of such disturbance are poorly known for African insectivorous bats. We studied the activity patterns of insectivorous bats in a tropical African forest at Kibale National Park, Uganda, using an Anabat bat detector. The echolocation calls of the vespertilionid bat Neoromicia nana were the most frequently detected. This species was most active in the ﬁrst 5 h after sunset with activity declining rapidly after midnight until sampling ﬁnished at 01:00 h. There was no difference in activity of N. nana levels between logged or undisturbed forest; however, this species exhibited higher levels of activity along the wide tracks running through the two forests than either 30 m off these tracks or along the narrow forest trails. The wing morphology and echolocation call of N. nana may be constraining it to ﬂying in uncluttered space on the edge of the forest, penetrating mostly along wider tracks and roads. Further research (in particular radio-telemetry) is required to test and validate these data.",

Search, approach and terminal phases were identified in the foraging activity of the species. During search phase, P. macleayii emitted calls consisting of a short CF component followed by a downward FM sweep (sCF-FM), typical of the small Pteronotus species. In addition, FM-sCF calls were recorded. In search flight some sequences consisted only of sCF-FM calls while others consisted only of FM-sCF calls. Most sequences, however, combined both call designs. Based on this and previous studies we suggest that sCF-FM and FM-sCF calls will characterize the vocal repertoire of each of the small Pteronotus species. We discuss the relevance of our results for acoustic identification of P. macleayii and the other small Pteronotus in the field.",

During hunting, N. cubanus search for insects emitting cries that sweep from 80 to 40 kHz in 4 to 12 ms. Search call characteristics correlate with the clutter structure of the hunting areas. Bats hunting in an uncluttered space broadcast longer and narrower signals, while bats hunting in cluttered space broadcast shorter and broadband signals. Longer calls were emitted with longer intervals while the duty cycle was kept below 15 % during search and approach phases. The call's minimal frequency remained about 43 kHz showing variation coefficients of less than 3%. As a consequence, bandwidth correlates positively with the maximal frequency. Calls emitted by different sympatric individuals are accurately classified by sender using a discriminant function analysis, suggesting vocal signatures in N. cubanus. The statistical analysis of several passes of calls broadcast during the hunting activity of a single individual, demonstrates a high intra-individual plasticity in vocal signatures and points to a dynamic system.",

            "abstractNote": "Pipistrelloid bats are among the most poorly known bats in Africa, a status no doubt exacerbated by their small size, drab brown fur and general similarity in external morphology. The systematic relationships of these bats have been a matter of debate for decades, and despite some recent molecular studies, much confusion remains. Adding to the confusion has been the recent discovery of numerous new species. Using two mitochondrial genes, we present a phylogeny for this group that supports the existence of three main clades in Africa: Pipistrellus, Neoromicia and the recently described Parahypsugo. However, the basal branches of the tree are poorly supported. Using an integrative taxonomic approach, we describe a new species of Pipistrellus sp. nov. from West Africa, which has been cited as Pipistrellus cf. grandidieri in the literature. We demonstrate that it is not closely related to Pipistrellus grandidieri from East Africa, but instead is sister to Pipistrellus hesperidus. Furthermore, the species Pi. grandidieri appears to be embedded in the newly described genus Parahypsugo, and is therefore better placed in that genus than in Pipistrellus. This has important taxonomic implications, because a new subgenus (Afropipistrellus) described for Pi. grandidieri predates Parahypsugo and should therefore be used for the entire “Parahypsugo” clade. The Upper Guinea rainforest zone, and particularly the upland areas in the south-eastern Guinea—northern Liberia border region may represent a global hotspot for pipistrelloid bats and should receive increased conservation focus as a result.",

            "abstractNote": "Roost selection by insectivorous bats in temperate regions is presumably influenced by roost microclimates in relation to thermoregulatory strategies, but few studies have included temperature measurements in habitat selection models. Rocky landscape features are an important source of roosts that provide both shelter from predators and beneficial microclimates for bats. Most information about rock-roosting bats has been derived from western North America. We studied microhabitat selection by the Eastern Small-footed Myotis (Myotis leibii) on natural talus slopes and human-made stone structures in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia and New Hampshire, relative to thermal and structural characteristics of rock crevices. Roosts were located with a combination of radiotelemetry and randomized visual surveys. Roost-switching behavior and structural characteristics of roosts did not appear to be influenced by the methods we used to locate roosts. Compared to random crevices, both sexes selected crevices with narrow openings, likely to provide protection from predators. Reproductive females also selected rocks that were larger and more thermally stable than random crevices, whereas males selected crevices that were structurally similar to random crevices but warmed more during the day. Rock size and other structural characteristics influenced temperatures of roosts and random crevices alike by inhibiting excessive daytime heating and nighttime cooling. Because large rocks were important for reproductive females, and talus slopes with large rocks could be limited, we recommend including rock size as a variable in landscape scale habitat assessments for Eastern Small-footed Myotis. Protecting or managing for habitat features with large rocks that receive high solar exposure could benefit Eastern Small-footed Myotis, and perhaps other rock-roosting species.",

We examined diet of the North American big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) using published works and our own data from New England to better understand intraspecific dietary variation, and to test whether diet corresponded with climate (an indicator of availability of prey) and species richness of bat communities (a measure of potential interspecific competition). Diet of both species of bat varied with climate in a manner that generally corresponded with longitude. E. fuscus increased use of moths in regions with cool arid summers (western North America), whereas both species of bat consumed more beetles in moister summer climates associated with eastern North America. Additionally, E. fuscus consumed fewer beetles and more moths and true flies in more diverse bat communities. However, correlation between richness of bat communities and mean monthly precipitation limits interpretation of whether richness of bat communities influenced foraging beyond effects of climate alone. Results suggest diet is influenced indirectly by environmental factors that limit availability of prey. Further examination of these and other factors related to intraspecific dietary variation in insectivorous bats is warranted and likely to yield valuable ecological insight.",

Location: North, Central and South America, Greater and Lesser Antilles. Methods: We analysed morphometric, genetic and environmental data from the entire distribution of T. brasiliensis. Individuals were genotyped at nine nuclear loci, and clustering analyses were used to detect genetic groups and test correlations between genetic, geographical, and environmental distances. Museum specimens were photographed and 111 two-dimensional landmarks were digitized per individual. Multivariate analyses were applied to explore whether factors such as sex, genetic group, subspecies, biogeographical regions, latitude, longitude and/or environment contribute to the morphometric variation of this species. We also applied a novel approach based on trend surface analyses and model selection to compare models of spatial and environmental dependence and to predict size, shape, and allometry-free variation across the Americas.",

Opportunities to evaluate the dynamics of the collapse of a sub-population on a vertebrate population in the wild are rare, requiring a crash during a long-term study of marked individuals. Endangered long-tailed bats Chalinolobus tuberculatus, which are members of the widespread family Vespertilionidae, live in closed social groups as evidenced by non-random associations of individuals and a low degree of mixing among colonies. During a 19-year mark-recapture study of long-tailed bats in the Eglinton Valley, New Zealand, one colony of bats collapsed over a 2-year period in which numbers of introduced predators were high. We investigated individual- and colony-level implications of this local extinction event. Survivors (11 known) were assimilated into the neighbouring colony during and immediately after the collapse, but retained higher association rates with individuals from their former colony. The neighbouring colony gradually extended its roosting range into habitat formerly occupied by the extinct colony. Acceptance of individuals into other colonies demonstrates resilience of highly structured vertebrate populations to local crashes.",

Most shape changes and structure development were observed at subadults and adults; zygomatic arch, sagittal crest, occipital process and mandibular processes developed noticeably up to the adult stage. Cranial sutures closure and fusion sequences of N. leporinus agree with that of hystricomorph rodents, artiodactyls, primates, sirenians and carnivores, beginning with the cranial vault followed by the basicranium, supporting a conserved pattern for mammalia. Detailed comparisons exhibit a complete cranial sutures fusion reached earlier at Desmodus rotundus regarding N. leporinus and Pteropus sp., and an early fusion for the sutura coronalis plus late fusion for the sutura sagittalis at N. leporinus regarding Desmodus rotundus. The drastic shape changes of cranial elements, as well as sutures closure and fusion in N. leporinus at subadults and adults, seem to be closely related to the acquisition of morphological specializations during stages of development when the fisher bat begins to feed independently.",

Developmental instability/stability (DI) is an organismal property associated with variance in bilateral asymmetry (fluctuating asymmetry—FA) and a correlated effect on fitness. This study provides evidence to corroborate the hypothesis that asymmetry partly reflects DI and is correlated with a reduction in fitness measured by survival and reproduction in bats. We studied two colonies of the bat Carollia perspicillata in southeastern Brazil over 5 years, marking and recapturing individuals. Gaussian mixture models for signed Forearm Asymmetry (ForA) distribution indicated that ~20% of asymmetry variation was due to DI heterogeneity among individuals. ForA, body condition (Scaled Mass Index—SMI) and Forearm Length (ForL) were used as predictors of survival probability in Cormack‐Jolly‐Seber models. Asymmetry was negatively associated with survival, whereas SMI and ForL were positively associated. The male C. perspicillata defend sites within the roost that are favoured by female harems, but there are mating opportunities for bachelor males, leading to both territorial disputes and sperm competition. As predicted by sexual selection, ForA was negatively associated with relative Testicle Length, a measure of reproductive potential. In females, ForA was negatively associated with the probability of two pregnancies (as opposed to one) in a given breeding season. The effect magnitudes and directions of associations suggest that asymmetry, even though not perfectly reflecting DI variation, is a useful predictor for fitness components in C. perspicillata.",

            "abstractNote": "Invasive species are a major cause of species extinction in freshwater ecosystems, and crayﬁsh species are particularly pervasive. The invasive American signal crayﬁsh Pacifastacus leniusculus has impacts over a range of trophic levels, but particularly on benthic aquatic macroinvertebrates. Our study examined the effect on the macroinvertebrate community of removal trapping of signal crayﬁsh from UK rivers. Crayﬁsh were intensively trapped and removed from two tributaries of the River Thames to test the hypothesis that lowering signal crayﬁsh densities would result in increases in macroinvertebrate numbers and taxon richness. We removed 6181 crayﬁsh over four sessions, resulting in crayﬁsh densities that decreased toward the center of the removal sections. Conversely in control sections (where crayﬁsh were trapped and returned), crayﬁsh density increased toward the center of the section. Macroinvertebrate numbers and taxon richness were inversely correlated with crayﬁsh densities. Multivariate analysis of the abundance of each taxon yielded similar results and indicated that crayﬁsh removals had positive impacts on macroinvertebrate numbers and taxon richness but did not alter the composition of the wider macroinvertebrate community. Synthesis and applications: Our results demonstrate that non-eradication-oriented crayﬁsh removal programmes may lead to increases in the total number of macroinvertebrates living in the benthos. This represents the ﬁrst evidence that removing signal crayﬁsh from riparian systems, at intensities feasible during control attempts or commercial crayﬁshing, may be beneﬁcial for a range of sympatric aquatic macroinvertebrates.",
