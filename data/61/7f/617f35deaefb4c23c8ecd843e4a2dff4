            "abstractNote": "Bat paramyxoviruses (PmV) are a diverse group of viruses and include zoonotic viruses such as henipaviruses. Members of this group in other continents have been associated with severe respiratory and neurological infections in animals and humans. Furthermore, despite the richness of diverse bat species that can transmit this virus in African countries like Nigeria, there is very scanty information as to the presence and co-­evolution of paramyxoviruses in bats. There is a need for continuous surveillance of zoonotic viruses and their biological reservoirs as this will help in the prevention and management of pathogens' spillovers. This study detected novel paramyxoviruses in Chaerephon nigeriae bat species found in Badagry, Lagos. Phylogenetic analyses of paramyxovirus sequences' co-­evolution with frugivorous and insectivorous bats circulating in African countries were also performed using sequences of African origin available in the Database of Bat-­Associated Viruses (DBatVir: http://www.mgc.ac.cn/ DBatVir/). Oral swabs (n = 18) and blood samples (n = 32) were collected from C. nigeriae bats in Badagry, Lagos. The L gene of bat paramyxovirus was detected in all oral swabs using PCR techniques. Six of the amplicons were successfully sequenced. Estimated phylogenies placed the sequences in close relationship with those isolated from insectivorous bats. Phylogenetic analyses of previously sequenced isolates in the African region showed the likelihood of different co-­evolution mechanisms of paramyxoviruses with frugivorous bats compared with insectivorous bats. This may be due to codon usage bias of the L gene. Spatial distribution of paramyxoviruses in African countries showed limited ongoing surveillance of this virus in the continent, especially in southern and northern countries. Extensive surveillance of paramyxoviruses with possible zoonotic potentials among bat species in the continent is recommended. This will provide further insights into co-­evolution as well as prevent possible spillover into the human population.",

Here we demonstrate the influence of conspecifics on call design. We found that the peak frequency used in calls varies more as the number of bats flying in the same space increases (measured from single bats and pairs of bats). We investigated this phenomenon through comparing call-parameter differences found between two bats recorded flying together (actual pairs) with call-parameter differences between two bats each recorded flying alone at different locations that were randomly assigned to one another (virtual pairs). We found that actual pairs of bats used calls which differed in peak frequency more so than did virtual pairs. This result is particularly striking given that these frequency differences were greater between bats in the same space than between bats in two different habitats. We argue that these differences indicate that this species is practicing jamming avoidance, air traffic control, or both.",

The search for effective biological control agents targeting P. destructans is of great importance. We report that the sesquiterpene trans, trans-farnesol, which is also a Candida albicans quorum sensing compound, prevented in vitro conidial germination for at least 14 days and inhibited growth of preexisting hyphae of five P. destructans isolates in filtered potato dextrose broth at 10 °C. Depending on the inoculation concentrations, both spore and hyphal inhibition occurred upon exposure to concentrations as low as 15–20 lM trans, trans-farnesol. In contrast, most North American Pseudogymnoascus isolates were more tolerant to the exposure of trans, trans-farnesol. Our results suggest that some Candida isolates may have the potential to inhibit the growth of P. destructans and that the sesquiterpene trans, trans-farnesol has the potential to be utilized as a biological control agent.",

Although bats exhibit different terrestrial locomotion capabilities involving hindlimbs, hindlimb morphology and postnatal development have been poorly studied. We describe in detail the postnatal development and bone morphology of hindlimbs of the nimble walker vampire bat, Desmodus rotundus, and compare adult characters with the insectivorous Molossus molossus (erratic walker) and the frugivorous Artibeus lituratus (non-walker). The advanced ossification of most hindlimb elements of D. rotundus at the newborn stage is consistent with the functional role of this structure at birth in bats. The development completion events of hindlimb bone elements and bone processes in D. rotundus coincide with the cranial bone processes completion and suture closure events. Those events occur when individuals begin to feed by themselves. There are differences in the number and position of bone processes and sesamoids in adults among the compared species, most of which are described for the first time, and in the case of D. rotundus and M. molossus mostly related to a greater and tight articulation between elements. These facts seem to be closely associated with the different terrestrial locomotion capabilities, and in the case of the exclusively sanguivorous D. rotundus with specializations for obtaining food.

In each locality, 18 bat boxes of both models were observed. The groups of three boxes were erected on separate trees. The rate of occupancy of standard boxes by Nathusius’ bats was found to be nearly six times higher than that of flat boxes. The absolute majority of bats used both models during the nursery and autumn migration season. Standard boxes were used by Nathusius’ pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus), pond bat (Myotis dasycneme), brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and noctule (Nyctalus noctula), whereas flat boxes were used only by Nathusius’ pipistrelle and pond bat.",

When echolocating in acoustically enriched environments, bats show many adaptations that are believed to facilitate signal extraction. Most studies to date focused on describing adaptations in insectivorous bats while frugivorous bats have rarely been tested. Here, we characterize how the frugivorous bat Carollia perspicillata adapts its echolocation behavior in response to acoustic playback. Since bats not only adapt their echolocation calls in response to acoustic interference but also with respect to target distances, we swung bats on a pendulum to control for distance-dependent call changes. Forward swings evoked consistent echolocation behavior similar to approach flights. By comparing the echolocation behavior recorded in the presence and absence of acoustic playback, we could precisely define the influence of the acoustic context on the bats’ vocal behavior. Our results show that C. perspicillata decrease the terminal peak frequencies of their calls when echolocating in the presence of acoustic playback. When considering the results at an individual level, it became clear that each bat dynamically adjusts different echolocation parameters across and even within experimental days. Utilizing such dynamics, bats create unique echolocation streams that could facilitate signal extraction in noisy environments.",

To identify features that may determine roost selection by M. myotis, we compared a range of structural and habitat variables for 17 maternity roosts and 17 unoccupied, but potentially suitable, buildings in the Moravian Karst (Czech Republic). Roosts and control sites were mainly in churches and chateaus and all were detached from the surrounding buildings and uninsulated. The only difference between habitat surrounding roost and control buildings was that roost buildings had relatively lower amounts of hedges as linear connective features. Our results suggest that bats do not select building features from among suitable detached and uninsulated churches and chateaus and that bats tend to select building roosts that are not connected to woodland by hedges. Protection of roosts is an important conservation issue for female M. myotis and suitable roost sites such as detached and uninsulated buildings that are not connected to woodland by hedges are important maternity roosting resources.",

            "abstractNote": "The two sibling bat species\n              Myotis myotis\n              and\n              Myotis blythii\n              occur in sympatry over wide areas of Southern and Central Europe. Morphological, ecological and previous genetic evidences supported the view that the two species constitute two well-differentiated groups, but recent phylogenetic analyses have shown that the two species shared some mtDNA haplotypes when they occurred in sympatry. In order to see whether some genetic exchange occurred between the two species, we sequenced a highly variable segment of the mitochondrial control region in both species living in sympatry and in allopatry. We also analysed the nuclear diversity of 160 individuals of both species found in two mixed nursery colonies located north and south of the Alps. MtDNA analysis confirmed that European\n              M. blythii\n              share multiple, identical or very similar haplotypes with\n              M. myotis\n              . Since allopatric Asian\n              M. blythii\n              presents mtDNA sequences that are very divergent from those of the two species found in Europe, we postulate that the mitochondrial genome of the European\n              M. blythii\n              has been replaced by that of\n              M. myotis\n              . The analysis of nuclear diversity shows a strikingly different pattern, as both species are well differentiated within mixed nursery colonies (\n              F\n              ST\n              =0.18). However, a Bayesian analysis of admixture reveals that the hybrids can be frequently observed, as about 25% of sampled\n              M. blythii\n              show introgressed genes of\n              M. myotis\n              origin. Contrastingly, less than 4% of the\n              M. myotis\n              analysed were classified as non-parental genotypes, revealing an asymmetry in the pattern of hybridization between the two species. These results show that the two species can interbreed and that the hybridization is still ongoing in the areas of sympatry. The persistence of well-differentiated nuclear gene pools, in spite of an apparent replacement of mitochondrial genome in European\n              M. blythii\n              by that of\n              M. myotis\n              , is best explained by a series of introgression events having occurred repeatedly during the recent colonization of Europe by\n              M. blythii\n              from Asia. The sharp contrast obtained from the analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear markers further points to the need to cautiously interpret results based on a single class of genetic markers.",

Here we report that a diverse guild of nectar-harvesting vertebrates visits pitchers of two common lowland Nepenthes species without providing any obvious beneﬁt for the plants. Over four consecutive ﬁeld seasons, we observed four species of sunbirds and one species of tree shrew drinking nectar from pitcher plants. Foraging activity was highest in the morning and late afternoon. Van Hasselt’s, Brown-throated and olive-backed sunbirds were regular and highly abundant pitcher visitors in two diﬀerent ﬁeld sites. A crimson sunbird and a lesser tree shrew were each observed harvesting nectar on one occasion. The vertebrates harvested nectar from the pitcher rim (peristome) of N. raﬄesiana and from the underside of the pitcher lid of N. gracilis. A comparison of the nectar production of these and three further sympatric species revealed exceptionally high quantities of nectar for N. raﬄesiana. Other factors such as plant and pitcher abundance and the habitat preferences of the observed vertebrates are likely to also play a role in their choice to visit particular species. This is the ﬁrst account of a case of obvious nectar robbing from Nepenthes pitchers by a guild of species that are too large to serve as prey, while the pitcher size and shape prevent faecal droppings from reaching the pitcher’s inside. This interaction provides an example of a possible starting point for the evolution of the elaborate mutualistic relationships observed in some species. Follow-up adaptations of pitcher shape could enable the plants to catch the droppings of their visitors and turn an exploitative relationship into a mutualism.",

The perches were located along the Zambezi River in Mana Pools National Park in Zimbabwe. With the exception of an occasional solifugid, N. grandis ate mainly insects in addition to frogs and other small vertebrates. Three species of katydids and many species of moths were the most common prey. While bats using one feeding perch fed heavily on two species of cicadas at times, those at the other perches rarely did. There also were differences in the incidences of antlions, mantids and beetles in the diets of bats using different perches. Extensive samples from two feeding roosts about 2 km apart showed significant differences in prey composition. Smaller samples from two sites closer to one another showed similar patterns of the incidence of different prey.",

When echolocating in acoustically enriched environments, bats show many adaptations that are believed to facilitate signal extraction. Most studies to date focused on describing adaptations in insectivorous bats while frugivorous bats have rarely been tested. Here, we characterize how the frugivorous bat Carollia perspicillata adapts its echolocation behavior in response to acoustic playback. Since bats not only adapt their echolocation calls in response to acoustic interference but also with respect to target distances, we swung bats on a pendulum to control for distance-dependent call changes. Forward swings evoked consistent echolocation behavior similar to approach flights. By comparing the echolocation behavior recorded in the presence and absence of acoustic playback, we could precisely define the influence of the acoustic context on the bats’ vocal behavior. Our results show that C. perspicillata decrease the terminal peak frequencies of their calls when echolocating in the presence of acoustic playback. When considering the results at an individual level, it became clear that each bat dynamically adjusts different echolocation parameters across and even within experimental days. Utilizing such dynamics, bats create unique echolocation streams that could facilitate signal extraction in noisy environments.",

            "abstractNote": "Integrating different lines of evidence is currently recognized as the most robust approach to investigating taxonomic questions, particularly those concerning cryptic diversity. In recent years, different sources of evidence have pointed to new cryptic taxa for bats, with the genus Hsunycteris being an excellent study group because of its large karyotypic variability and high genetic divergence revealed by the latest taxonomic and systematic reviews. This study tests the cryptic diversity hypothesis for the Hsunycteris thomasi complex through an integrative approach using species delimitation, phylogenetic analysis, chromosome painting, and linear morphometry. Our results suggest the existence of three lineages for H. thomasi that are morphologically indistinguishable, confirming the two previously described lineages in the literature and adding a third. We argue that the paraphyly in H. thomasi, as reported by previous studies, should be treated as independent species since they have unique evolutionary histories. Finally, we demonstrate that chromosomal and molecular methods are indispensable for recognizing and confirming groups that include cryptic species or species with confusing and controversial taxonomy.",

These bats are known only from a narrow belt of the Mediterranean zone in Maghreb and from NE Libya. We analysed museum specimens of African populations of P. pipistrellus s.l. using both morphologic and genetic techniques and compared them with Eurasian specimens of the complex. The African representatives of P. pipistrellus complex include two morphologically, genetically and geographically distinct populations. One of them inhabits the Mediterranean part of Cyrenaica, Libya. Belonging to the P. pygmaeus genetic lineage, these bats are represented by larger and more rusty coloured individuals with large massive rostrum and canines. In morphologic traits, this population differs significantly from all Western Palaearctic populations of the P. pipistrellus complex. These bats differ by about 6–7% in genetic distance from P. pygmaeus s. str. Within the P. pygmaeus lineage Libyan bats seem to be unique in their echolocation calls: the maximum energy of terminal frequencies was recorded at about 45 kHz. We consider the Libyan pipistrelles to represent a separate species, Pipistrellus hanaki sp. nov. Another distinct African pipistrelle population inhabits the Mediterranean parts of NW African countries, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. Individuals from the latter population are small and somewhat darker members of the P. pipistrellus genetic lineage, with relatively short and narrow mesial part of rostrum. Although both morphological and genetic differences between this population and Eurasian P. pipistrellus s. str. were found (genetic distance about 3–5%), they are probably not sufficient for the separation of this form at the specific level. However, the differences from European samples show rather not a cline character and therefore potential subspecific level of NW African P. pipistrellus has to be taken into consideration.",

Common in the north-western part of North Africa, the species is missing more to the east. Hereby we report the first record in Libya, considerably extending its known geographic range. Additionally, we performed a species distribution modelling (SDM) analysis to explore its potential distribution in North Africa. The final SDM depicted a relatively wellknown distribution and predicted that the suitable bioclimatic areas for this species are essentially found within the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome.",

            "abstractNote": "Small insectivorous bats often enter a state of torpor, a controlled, reversible decrease in body temperature and metabolic rate. Torpor provides substantial energy savings and is used more extensively during periods of low temperature and reduced prey availability. We studied torpor use and activity of a small (10.1 ± 0.4 g) fishing bat, Myotis macropus, during winter in a mild climate in Australia. We predicted that the thermal stability of water would make foraging opportunities in winter more productive and consistent in a riparian habitat compared to a woodland habitat, and therefore, fishing bats would use torpor less than expected during winter compared to other bats. Using temperature-sensitive radio transmitters, we recorded the skin temperature of 12 adult (6 M, 6 F) bats over 161 bat-days (13.4 ± 5.4 days per bat) during Austral winter (late May to August), when daily air temperature averaged 6.2–18.2°C. Bats used torpor every day, with bouts lasting a median of 21.3 h and up to 144.6 h. Multiday torpor bouts were more common in females than males. Arousals occurred just after sunset and lasted 3.5 ± 2.9 h. Arousals tended to be longer in males than females and to occur on warmer evenings, suggesting some winter foraging and perhaps male harem territoriality or other mating-related activity was occurring. The extensive use of torpor by M. macropus during relatively mild winter conditions when food is likely available suggests torpor might function to minimize the risks of mortality caused by activity and to increase body condition for the upcoming breeding season.",

These pups (n = 11) died over an 11-day period and were submitted to a government laboratory for testing where ABLV infection was confirmed. Over the next several weeks, additional ABLV cases in flying foxes in Queensland were also detected. Brain tissue from ABLV-infected flying foxes during this period, as well as archived brain tissue, was selected for next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the two groups of pups were each infected from single sources. They were likely exposed while in crèche at night as their dams foraged. This study identifies crèche-age pups at a potentially heightened risk for mass ABLV infection.",

The host specimen, a little known molossid bat (Myopterus whitleyi), constitutes the first record of this species in CAR. The new flea species appears taxonomically close to A. hetera Beaucournu & Fain, 1982, one of the two other Allopsylla species, previously know from other faunal regions (A. alloides in Nigeria and A. hetera in Democratic Republic of the Congo). The parasitism of three distinctly different hosts by the three known Allopsylla species raises questions regarding the hostparasite specificity of this group.",

Echolocation signals were recorded in the ﬁeld in south-eastern Moravia and northern Bohemia (Czech Republic) and in an ad hoc experimental laboratory. For each of the species, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated signiﬁcant differences in calls produced inside the experimental room and in the open. Paired t-tests and MANOVA were also used to reveal inﬂuences of interindividual contacts in each of the cryptic species on the spectral patterns of call variables. Differences were found in the spectral variables of echolocation calls of an individual ﬂying in the room alone and in a group of conspeciﬁcs. The possibility that bats use their ﬂexibility to avoid mutual disturbances of echolocation calls was tested. We found that bats ﬂying in a group modify the parameters of their echolocation signals according to the presence of other individuals of the same species. These differences can indicate jamming avoidance and recognition of own echoes. However, they did not change the parameters if individuals of another species were present. Social calls are more numerous when bats ﬂy in a mixedspecies group than in a monospeciﬁc group.",

The phenology of display and swarming behaviour were studied using bat detectors and mist nettings in the ruins of Nový Hrádek castle (southwestern Moravia, Czech Republic), where P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus hibernate in mixed-species clusters. We hypothesize that if both pipistrelle species share the same swarming site and hibernaculum they can compete with each other and their mating and courtship activity can be separate over time. The highest songflight activity was found between mid-August and mid-September. At the beginning of the mating period, songflights of both species were recorded in the second third of the night, whereas from the end of September, the peak of display activity moved to the first third of the night. We did not find clear evidence for temporal niche partitioning between species during autumn mating behaviour at locality of study. Proportion of P. pygmaeus observed in the hibernaculum was significantly higher than its observed in acoustic recordings and in mist-netted bats. It may show different mating behaviour between both pipistrelle species. Males of P. pipistrellus produced display calls close to hibernacula, whereas males of P. pygmaeus probably mate elsewhere, likely before any long autumnal migration near nursery colonies.",

This data extends its distribution range in Central Europe and confirms it as a native breeding species in Poland. Specific identification of bats was confirmed by sequencing ND1 gene of mtDNA. In Poland its reproduction has been recorded in Łężczok reserve, Silesian Foothill and in Roztocze National Park. Bats were observed mostly within old broadleaved and mixed forests, near water, at altitude ranging from 112 to 736 m a.s.l. The only known roosting site for the species is a cave which is used both in spring and during the swarming period. In Poland the species co-occurred with both M. brandtii and M. mystacinus or with M. brandtii at all sites.",

Bats have a long-standing reputation for being highly sensitive to stressors, with sensitivity and resilience varying both within and among species, yet little is known about how stress affects the signaling that regulates reproductive physiology. Here, we provide the first description of the molecular response of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis of male big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in response to short-term stress using a standardized restraint manipulation. This acute stressor was sufficient to upregulate plasma corticosterone and resulted in a rapid decrease in circulating testosterone. While we did not find differences in the mRNA expression of key steroidogenic enzymes (StAR, aromatase, 5-alpha reductase), seminiferous tubule diameter was reduced in stressed bats coupled with a 5-fold increase in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression in the testes. These changes, in part, may be mediated by RFamide-related peptide (RFRP) because fewer immunoreactive cell bodies were detected in the brains of stressed bats compared with controls – suggesting a possible increase in secretion – and increased RFRP expression locally in the gonads. The rapid sensitivity of the bat testes to stress may be connected to deleterious impacts on tissue health and function as supported by significant transcriptional upregulation of key pro-apoptotic signaling molecules (Bax, cytochrome c). Experiments like this broadly contribute to our understanding of the stronger ecological predictions regarding physiological responses of bats within the context of stress, which may impact decisions surrounding animal handling and conservation approaches.",

Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the diet of Tadarida brasiliensis along the Yungas Forest, Argentina, at sites with different degrees of disturbance. Through the analysis of feces, arthropod orders were identified, volume and frequency of occurrence were estimated for each food item, and the niche breadth was estimated for the species. Finally, the diet was compared between capture sites, sexes, and seasons; finding variations among sites and seasons. The diet of T. brasiliensis contains arthropods belonging to nine orders and one undetermined taxon. Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera represent the highest volume proportions in the diet. The results add new and important information about the biology of T. brasiliensis in the southern part of its distribution.",

Samples were classified in nine groups to avoid seasonal and geographical bias. Individual differences (studied only in females) identified one dominant plant species by locality, but with exceptions, suggesting individual opportunistic or feeding preferences. For sexual differences a \"Gw\" test (with William´s correction) was applied; four bat groups have important differences, four groups have minor differences and in one group, male and female diets were similar.",

            "abstractNote": "The vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is a haematophagous animal that feeds exclusively on the blood of domestic mammals. Vampire bat feeding habits enable their contact with mammalian hosts and may enhance zoonotic spillover. Moreover, they may carry several pathogenic organisms, including coronaviruses (CoVs), for which they are important hosts. The human pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and possibly coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) all originated in bats but required bridge hosts to spread into human populations. To monitor the presence of potential zoonotic viruses in bats, the present work evaluated the presence of CoVs in vampire bats from southern Brazil. A total of 101 vampire bats were captured and euthanized between 2017 and 2019 in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and intestines were collected and macerated individually. The samples were pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and subsequently individually screened using a pancoronavirus RTPCR protocol. We detected CoV-related sequences in HTS, but only two (2/101; 1.98%) animals had CoV detected in the intestines by RT-PCR. Partial sequences of RdRp and spike genes were obtained in the same sample and the RdRp region in the other sample. The sequences were classified as belonging to Alphacoronavirus. The sequences were closely related to alphacoronaviruses detected in vampire bats from Peru. The continuous monitoring of bat CoVs may help to map and predict putative future zoonotic agents with great impacts on human health.",

            "abstractNote": "The organophosphorous (OP) pesticide fenthion is widely used in commercial fruit industry and orchards in South America. Among the metabolic effects in mammals caused by fenthion, hyperglycemia occurs via the activation of hepatic metabolic pathways, which may interfere with the function of several organs and systems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute and sub-chronic levels of fenthion on energy metabolism and liver morphology of frugivorous bats (Artibeus lituratus), which usually feed on fruits cultivated on South American plantations where fenthion is used. Animals were fed fruit treated with fenthion by immersion of fruit in a solution containing fenthion (500 ppm) and an adhesive spreader (200 ppm). Blood glucose levels did not change due to fenthion treatment, but muscle glycogen content increased and carcass fatty acids decreased after acute exposure. An increase in hepatocyte cell diameter further characterized as an increase in vacuolization was observed. The results indicate that fenthion may affect some components of energy metabolism and promote alterations in hepatocyte morphology in frugivorous bats when applied to cultivated fruits at the recommended rates.",

            "abstractNote": "Resource selection by animals inﬂuences ecological processes such as dispersal, reproduction, foraging, and migration. Little information exists regarding foraging resource selection by bats during the maternity season. We evaluated support for effects of landcover type, landform, and landscape pattern on resource selection by individual foraging female eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) during the maternity period and compared resource utilization for all individuals pooled (population level), individuals grouped by geographic location, and individuals grouped by stage of lactation (early, mid, and late). We used a resource utilization function (RUF) to relate landcover and landscape attributes to the utilization distributions of individual bats estimated by the ﬁxed-kernel method. We radio-tracked 64 lactating red bats and estimated utilization distributions for 52 individuals. Mean home range size ranged from 1,041 to 1,588 ha from late to mid lactation. The global RUF model was signiﬁcantly better than the null RUF model for 36 (70%) individuals and the magnitude and direction of coefﬁcients varied among individuals. Resource utilization at the population level was, on average, positively related to ridges and upland drainage landforms, water landcover, and road density; and negatively related to urban and nonforest landcover and distance to edge. Resource use differed between geographic areas by canopy cover, water landcover, and road density. Canopy closure was positively related to RUF in both areas but was greater in the south area. Percent water negatively related to RUF in the north area and positively related in the south area. Road density had a positive relationship in the north and negative relationship in the south with RUF. We did not ﬁnd a difference in mean RUF coefﬁcients among lactation groups except for canopy cover. On average, canopy cover had a positive effect on use by bats during early and mid-lactation but a negative effect during late lactation. We suggest that management for red bats consider landscape components and provide a range of composition and structural diversity to enhance foraging use by red bats. In highly forested landscapes, gaps or openings may provide forest edges that are important for foraging and commuting. Published 2014.

            "abstractNote": "The western red bat (Lasiurus blossevillii) is a foliage-roosting species of riparian habitats in arid regions of the southwestern United States. Only limited published anecdotal observations exist for roost sites used by this species. Western red bats were split taxonomically from the eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) in 1988, but summaries of roosting behaviors for western red bats still appear to stem from former associations with the commonly studied eastern red bat. Our study represents the first comprehensive research on the roosting ecology of western red bats. We radio-tracked 14 adult bats to 19 different day roosts along the Mimbres River of southwestern New Mexico. While we documented that western red bats had an affinity for densely foliated trees (79%), we did not detect any selection for tree species or size. At our study site, western red bats roosted in cottonwoods (47%, Populus spp.), velvet ash (21%, Fraxinus velutina), box elder (16%, Acer negundo), and red mulberry (16%, Morus rubra). We also described clustering behavior, where groups of 2–3 adults roosted in direct contact with one another. Although the species was deemed to roost solitarily, the frequency of clustering behavior in our study suggests otherwise. If bats were observed in clusters, they typically exhibited greater roosting fidelity than solitary individuals. Because arid riparian corridors in the southwestern United States generally are considered threatened systems, protection and preservation of mechanisms that create and maintain the diversity of these riparian corridors is necessary for the survival of this uncommon and poorly understood species.",

Analysis of these parameters revealed a number of significant differences between the regions, especially in variables related t o frequency. However, discriminant function analysis revealed extensive overlap in call parameters for the different regions. It can be concluded that. although there are differences in some parameters between regions, calls are similar overall in the five geographic regions investigated, and that the slight geographic variation which does occur does not confound the identification of C. gouldii.",

Despite the lack of consensus among researchers as to whether bats are important predators of mosquitoes, there have been no attempts to directly document the effect of bats on mosquito populations or behavior. We conducted an enclosure experiment to test the hypothesis that bats reduce the local abundance of ovipositing female mosquitoes by examining whether the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis Trouessart) had an effect on Culex spp. (Diptera: Culicidae) oviposition, using naturally occurring mosquitoes, either through direct predation or trait mediated effects on mosquito behavior. We found a signiÞcant, 32% reduction in egg-laying activity associated with bat predation. ArtiÞcial oviposition habitats directly outside bat enclosures experienced no reduction in oviposition; we attributed the observed reduction in egg-laying activity to direct predation on ovipositing females by bats and not changes in mosquito behavior. In addition, we noted a decrease in the number of larval mosquitoes in enclosures exposed to bat predation. These results suggest the impact of aerial predators on pathogen transmission may be large, and warrants further scientiÞc investigation.",

Postnatal growth curves for length of forearm and body mass were determined separately for the different colonies and years. Cooler weather during June 2001 coincided with a median birth date that was 8 days later than in 2000, whilst the difference between colonies was 4 and 5 days, respectively, for the pooled data of both years. Cool temperatures in June also coincided with a longer duration of the parturition period. Postnatal growth rates were higher than in most other bat species but differences between years and colonies were considerable. These differences may be attributed to the ambient roost temperatures, whereby the young of two cooler roosts showed signiﬁcantly reduced growth rate during 8 days of cool weather in 2000. Moreover, later born and therefore smaller pups were more strongly affected by low temperatures than earlier born and larger ones. The mean length of forearm of young lesser horseshoe bats at the beginning of September equalled that of adult bats, whilst their body mass was still lower. Non-volant juveniles did not cluster following the nightly emergence of adult females, and a preferred location within the roosts could not be identiﬁed. High and very low roost temperatures, however, did have an inﬂuence on the location of non-volant young in the colonies.",

Wildlife is often disturbed by these largely unpredictable activities, and animals may have limited opportunities to adapt. Mountain hares\n                    Lepus timidus\n                    are affected by this increase in alpine tourism, but their physiological and behavioural reactions to tourist activity are still unknown.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We measured the levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (\n                    GCM\n                    ) in wild mountain hares living in areas that had no, medium or high levels of tourist activity during winter in 2011. Furthermore, we compared the changes in\n                    GCM\n                    excretion, behaviour and food intake of six captive mountain hares following predator challenge experiments from early to mid‐winter.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Our field results showed that\n                    GCM\n                    excretion is positively correlated with increased tourism intensity. In the predator challenge experiments, hares spent less time resting and grooming (including re‐ingesting faecal pellets) during and after the stress treatments. These stress events lead to higher energy demands due to flushing, increased\n                    GCM\n                    levels, and disrupted the energy intake that hares derive from faeces.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We conclude that mountain hares living in areas with frequent human winter recreational activities show changes in physiology and behaviour that demand additional energy in winter, when access to food resources is limited by snow.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    . To bring down the frequency of stress threats for mountain hares, we recommend that managers keep forests inhabited by mountain hares free of tourism infrastructure and retain undisturbed forest patches within skiing areas.

We identified this character using thermal infrared imaging and investigated the vasculature using barium sulfate enhanced microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). Micro-CT images revealed unique arrangements of arteries and veins in the region of the radiator positioned perpendicular to the axis of the body. Coupling micro-CT imaging with analysis of surface temperature profiles, we concluded that radiators aid in thermoregulation during flight in variable environments. This study represents the first application of contrast enhanced micro-CT to visualize vasculature of bats and thus exhibits a promising technique for further investigations of cardiovascular function and anatomy in bats.

In particular, we assessed the timing of spring emergence from, and autumn entry into, hibernation, reproduction, and seasonal mass fluctuations. We used a combination of acoustic monitoring and capture surveys at two hibernacula and two maternity roosts during 2011 and 2012. Myotis spp. were active at the hibernacula from late April to late September/early October, suggesting that the “active” season length is similar to that of populations farther south. At maternity colonies, we detected M. lucifugus activity from early May to early October, with peaks during mid-July in both years. Lactation, fledging, and weaning all occurred later in the NWT than at more southern locations, and reproductive rates were significantly lower than rates observed farther south. The average mass of individuals fluctuated throughout the season, with an initial decline immediately following emergence from hibernation likely reflecting increased energy expenditure due to flight and decreased use of torpor, coupled with relatively low prey intake due to low prey abundance associated with cool temperatures. Females did not appear to have lower pre-hibernation masses than those in more southern populations, suggesting that despite the cool spring and autumn temperatures, and short summer nights, bats are able to obtain enough energy for reproduction and mass accumulation for hibernation. However, the lower reproductive rates may indicate that there are limitations to life at the northern limits of the species’ range.",

            "abstractNote": "The vast majority of trypanosome species is vector-borne parasites, with some of them being medically and veterinary important (such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei) and capable of causing serious illness in vertebrate hosts. The discovery of trypanosomes in bats emphasizes the importance of bats as an important reservoir. Interestingly, there is a hypothesis that bats are ancestral hosts of T. cruzi. Trypanosome diversity has never been investigated in bats in Thailand, despite being in a biodiversity hot spot. To gain a better understanding of the diversity and evolutionary relationship of trypanosomes, polymerase chain reaction-based surveys were carried out from 2018 to 2020 in 17 sites. A total of 576 bats were captured, representing 23 species. A total of 38 (6.6%) positive samples was detected in ten bat species. Trypanosoma dionisii and Trypanosoma noyesi were identified from Myotis siligorensis and Megaderma spasma, respectively. The remaining 18S rRNA sequences of trypanosomes were related to other trypanosomes previously reported elsewhere. The sequences in the current study showed nucleotide identity as low as 90.74% compared to those of trypanosomes in the GenBank database, indicating the possibility of new species. All bat trypanosomes identified in the current study fall within the T. cruzi clade. The current study adds to evidence linking T. noyesi to a bat trypanosome and further supports the bat host origin of the T. cruzi clade. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first study on bat trypanosomes in Thailand and their phylogenetic relationships with global isolates.",

            "abstractNote": "Amphibians are experiencing a panzootic of unprecedented proportions caused by the emergence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). However, all species are not equally at risk of infection, and risk is further modified by environmental variables, specifically temperature. In order to understand how, and when, hosts mount a response to Bd we analysed infection dynamics and patterns of gene expression in the model amphibian species Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis. Mathematical modelling of infection dynamics demonstrate the existence of a temperature-dependent protective response that is largely independent of the intrinsic growth-rate of Bd. Using temporal expression-profiling by microarrays and qRT-PCR, we characterise this response in the main amphibian lymphoid tissue, the spleen. We demonstrate that clearance of Bd at the host-optimal temperature is not clearly associated with an adaptive immune response, but rather is correlated with the induction of components of host innate immunity including the expression of genes that are associated with the production of the antimicrobial skin peptide preprocareulein (PPCP) as well as inflammatory responses. We find that adaptive immunity appears to be lacking at host-optimal temperatures. This suggests that either Bd does not stimulate, or suppresses, adaptive immunity, or that trade-offs exist between innate and adaptive limbs of the amphibian immune system. At cold temperatures, S. tropicalis loses the ability to mount a PPCP-based innate response, and instead manifests a more pronounced inflammatory reaction that is characterised by the production of proteases and higher pathogen burdens. This study demonstrates the temperature-dependency of the amphibian response to infection by Bd and indicates the influence that changing climates may exert on the ectothermic host response to pathogens.",

            "abstractNote": "We presented a comparative study of two species of South American bats, Myotis albescens and Eumops patagonicus, about prenatal development. This study was carried out using 60 specimens, which were measured and photographed, and the embryonic stage was assigned by the staging system for Carollia perspicillata. We observed that the chorionic vesicle showed similarities in the disposition of the extraembryonic membranes, but they differed in characteristics of their yolk sac; in E. patagonicus, it was more glandular than M. albescens. M. albescens presented a well-developed discoid placenta with a caudal antimesometrial position, but E. patagonicus presented a diffuse placenta, which persists until the end of gestation and a discoid placenta in the uterus–tubal junction. In the embryogenesis, early stages, middle stages, and late stages were deﬁned. In the early stage, the embryonic morphology is similar in the two species. The middle stage is characterized by the muzzle and pinna formation, fore and hind limb regionalization, and the formation of the patagium primordium. In the late stage, the overall growth of the embryo occurs. Its fore and hind limbs, patagium, and the typical craniofacial features are conﬁgured. We conclude that in early stages of development, the embryonic morphology of M. albescens and E. patagonicus is similar, while in late stages differences are evident; mainly the craniofacial structures and uropatagium conﬁguration characteristics that allow their classiﬁcation at the family level. Moreover, differences in time of fusion of maxillary and mandibular process were registered. This could be related to the morphology of the muzzle of each species.

We measured BMR and plasma levels of thyroid hormone (T3) and leptin in bats captured in maternity colonies in eastern Massachusetts (MA; northern population) and in Alabama and Georgia (ALGA; southern population) to assess macrogeographic (between- or among-population) and microgeographic (within-population) variation in those traits. After accounting for effects of body mass, stage of pregnancy, and within-population variation, bats from the northern population did not differ signiﬁcantly in BMR, T3, or leptin values from those in the southern population. However, after accounting for the effects of body mass and stage of pregnancy, a test for differences in all traits among colonies from both populations was signiﬁcant. For BMR, bats differed signiﬁcantly among the northern colonies. Moreover, after removing the effects of body mass and stage of pregnancy, bats from the AL colony had signiﬁcantly higher BMR than did bats from all other colonies except one in MA, and they had signiﬁcantly higher T3 levels but lower leptin levels than did bats from two other colonies. The presence of among-colony and withinpopulation variation for these traits suggests that proximate (nonevolutionary) factors (e.g., microhabitat differences such as roost type) play an important role in shaping intraspeciﬁc variation in BMR and its hormone correlates.",

As a result, artiﬁcial roosts are increasingly proposed as a short to medium-term mitigation measure, despite the absence of speciﬁc protocols for the installation, maintenance, and suitability for New Zealand bats. As of 2021, more than 110 artiﬁcial roosts had been installed in urban parks within Hamilton City, New Zealand. To determine their uptake and suitability for long-tailed bats, 74 Kent style roosts of varying ages were monitored for 1 year, with 24 (32%) roosts observed occupied by long-tailed bats. Occupation was generally infrequent, with no clear seasonal pattern or speciﬁc areas of occupation. However, two older roosts were consistently occupied, with numbers notably increasing during the summer maternity season. Distance to stand edge was the only factor that could be used to predict occupation, with logistic regression indicating that long-tailed bats may prefer roosts in less exposed areas with stable microclimates, within tree stands or sheltered landscape features. Future artiﬁcial roost installations should site roosts away from the stand edge in sheltered locations, ideally near natural or already occupied roosts to facilitate discovery and uptake.",

We used radiotelemetry to track 9 adult females, including 3 lactating and 6 postlactating bats, during July–September 2003. We found that these bats showed considerable fidelity to a common foraging area at the confluence of the John Day River and a tributary creek along which bats commuted and roosted. Individual bats did not roost together, but each showed high fidelity to local clusters of rock outcrops in small side canyons along the tributary. Roosts were not found in large, exposed cliff faces, despite the availability of such features. Rather, radio-tagged bats roosted in smaller outcrops that averaged 4.5 m in height. Bats commuted up to 12 km from roosts in the tributary canyon to the common foraging site at the river confluence and remained on the wing to forage for up to 4 h before returning to day roosts. No radio-tagged bats were observed using night roosts, even after pups were weaned. Our study provides a description of roosting, commuting, and foraging activity, as well as habitat use, of western small-footed myotis. This information provides a nuanced perspective on the ecology of canyon-dwelling bats in the region. Such perspective could be useful for conservation and habitat management.",

The skull measurements of 11 out of the 12 species were osteometrically examined using principal component analyses (PCA) based on 33 craniodental measurements from 150 specimens. Our analyses indicated that according to the overall skull size, the studied species could be divided as follows: large species (M. tiensa and M. fionae), medium-sized species (M. huttoni, M. cyclotis, M. annamitica, M. beelzebub, M. walstoni, and M. feae), and small species (M. eleryi, M. chrysochaetes, and M. harpioloides). The three size clusters did not overlap with each other in terms of total length of the skull (STOTL), mandible length (ML) and log-transformed raw data PC1 scores. Within a cluster, several species pairs overlapped in overall skull size despite of differences in the shapes. The PCA results suggested that Murina species of Vietnam were differentiated with a combination of the skull size and shape. Sexual dimorphism was confirmed in M. cyclotis and M. annamitica, with the females larger than the males. Particularly, M. cyclotis showed extensive sexual dimorphism with no overlaps in the measurements, whereas M. annamitica showed less measurable differences between the sexes. It was also evidenced that the extent of sexbiased size dimorphism differs among species in the genus Murina.",

We found that although R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx were the two primary seed dispersers of S. oblatum over half of the fruit produced by the tree (65%) fell to the ground. Out of the fruit collected, R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx were able to disperse seeds up to 73 m from the parent tree with the highest density of feeding roosts occurring at 21.3 m (SE = 5.2 m). We found no signs that either species of bat used the parent tree as a feeding roost, instead choosing speciﬁc trees that were at lower densities compared with other trees in the forest that were not used. When comparing the viability of seeds in three different habitats (under parent tree, in forest gap, under feeding roost) survival analysis revealed that seedling survival was signiﬁcantly higher in the forest gap (91.7% ± 4.41%) than under the parent tree (78.3% ± 1.67%), but was not signiﬁcantly different to seedling survival underneath feeding roosts (86.7 ± 1.67%). Further work also showed that the seeds did not have to be removed from the fruit or ingested by the bat in order to germinate. We conclude that although S. oblatum is not dependent on R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx for successful germination of its seeds, these two species of bat are important seed dispersers and can move seeds to areas where there is a greater chance of germination success and survival.",

Therefore, our aim was to investigate physiological and behavioural strategies employed by the fruit bat Nyctimene robinsoni (body mass ~50g) in winter in tropical Northern Queensland in relation to ambient temperature (Ta) and the lunar cycle. Daily body temperature (Tb) fluctuations in free-ranging bats were measured via radio-telemetry and metabolic rate was measured in captivity via open-flow respirometry (Ta, 15–30°C). Free-ranging bats showed a significant 24h circadian cycle in Tb, with the lowest Tb at the end of the rest phase just after sunset and the highest Tb at the end of the activity phase just before sunrise. Average daily core Tb ranged from 34.7±0.6 to 37.3±0.8°C (mean ± s.d.) over an average daily Ta range of 17.1±1.1 to 23.5±1.8°C. Tb never fell below 30°C but Tb was significantly reduced during the full moon period compared with that during the new moon period. Tb was correlated with Ta during the second half of the rest phase (P<0.001) but not during the active phase. Resting metabolic rate of bats was significantly affected by Ta (P<0.001, R20.856). Our results show that tube-nosed bats exhibit reduced Tb on moonlit nights when they reduce foraging activity, but during our study torpor was not expressed. The energy constraints experienced here by tube-nosed bats with relatively moderate Ta fluctuations, short commuting distances between roosting and feeding locations, and high availability of food were probably not substantial enough to require use of torpor.",

The lesser longnosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) is classiﬁed as threatened in Mexico; however, many aspects of its reproductive biology are still unstudied. The formation of a dorsal patch in males of Leptonycteris spp. during the mating period has been described and evidence suggests this patch is involved in reproductive behavior. We determined the male reproductive cycle of L. yerbabuenae over time based on the seminiferous cycle. We then related these internal indicators with 3 external indicators—testis size, dorsal patch size, and female/male ratio in the population. Finally, we evaluated whether the epididymis functions in long-term sperm storage. Bats were captured monthly and external indicators were registered. Three adult males were euthanized each month for the evaluation of internal indicators. We determined only 1 period of spermatogenesis per year beginning in September and completing in January. The seminiferous epithelium cycle showed 11 stages and 14 steps. Internal reproductive indicators were correlated with external indicators. External testis size and female/male ratio were positively correlated with dorsal patch size. A testis size of approximately 48.2 mm2 corresponded with the beginning of sperm production. The epididymis was not involved in long-term sperm storage. This study provides the 1st description in L. yerbabuenae of the annual timing of the male reproductive cycle based on histological characteristics, and also reports a relationship between the size of the dorsal patch and male reproductive function.",

            "abstractNote": "Generalized pollination systems may be advantageous on island systems or regions of substantial disturbance. We examined whether or not specialization breakdown has occurred in a presumably bat-pollinated columnar cactus, Pilosocereus royenii, on Puerto Rico, an island subjected to periodic hurricanes. The ﬂowers show characteristics related to bat pollination including nocturnal anthesis, morphology, and amount and quality of nectar reward. The cactus produces ﬂowers whose styles are temporally and mechanically separated from its anthers and do not self-pollinate. Hand manipulations indicated that it is partially self-incompatible or suffers some inbreeding depression. In 217 h of observations conducted biweekly over the course of 1 yr, P. royenii received visits from bats, moths, bees, and birds, but the only effective pollinator was the carpenter bee, Xylocopa mordax. Only four bat visits were recorded, all prior to stigma receptiveness. Floral morphology of P. royenii was signiﬁcantly more variable than that of other bat-pollinated species of the genus. We propose that infrequent bat visits are a consequence of a population crash and that ﬂoral variability is due to either relaxed selection for bat pollination or a transitional stage from bat pollination to bee pollination.",

            "abstractNote": "The Atacama Myotis is an endangered and poorly studied bat species, endemic from Peru and Chile. Using mist nets and ultrasonic recordings we release new information on activity patterns and roost use by M. atacamensis in Chile. We also report new records for the species, extending its distribution range to Santiago Metropolitan region. Our results suggest a wide distribution and relative abundance of M. atacamensis in northern Chile, in addition to remarkable habitat diversity for populations of this species. Bats were active in both natural and anthropogenic habitats. Abandoned mines and buildings in rural villages were the roosts most used by the species. These data provide additional information on the distribution, ecology, and natural history of M. atacamensis and can be useful in the design of conservation action plans for populations in the country.",

            "abstractNote": "Stenocereus quevedonis (‘pitire’) is a columnar cactus endemic to central Mexico, grown for its edible fruit. Phenology, pollination biology and behaviour of ﬂower visitors of this species were compared in six conserved and disturbed sites, hypothesising that: (i) pitire pollination is self-incompatible, requiring animal vectors; (ii) higher incidence of radiation on plants in cleared forest may lead to a higher number of ﬂowers per pitire plant and longer blooming season, and disturbing and differential spatial availability of ﬂower resources may determine differential attraction of pollinators to conserved and disturbed areas; (iii) if pitire pollination system is specialised, reproductive success would decrease with pollinator scarcity, or other species may substitute for main pollinators. In all sites, pitire reproduction started in January, ﬂowering peak occurring in April, anthesis duration was 15 h and predominantly nocturnal (9 h), pollen was released at 23:00 h, nectar was produced throughout anthesis, and breeding system was self-incompatible. Flower production per plant was similar in disturbed and conserved sites, but ﬂower availability was higher (because of higher tree density) and longer in disturbed sites. Pollination is nocturnal, the most frequent legitimate pollinator being the bat Leptonycteris yerbabuenae; diurnal pollination is rare but possible, carried out by bee species. Fruit and seed set in control and nocturnal pollination treatments at disturbed sites were higher than in conserved sites. Frequency of L. yerbabuenae visits was similar among site types, but more visits of complementary nocturnal and diurnal pollinators were recorded in disturbed sites, which could explain differences in reproductive success.",

Our study provides pre-WNS (2009) capture rates and roosting-behavior data for Northern Long-eared Bats in the southern Appalachians. We conducted mist-net surveys at 37 sites and radio-tracked female Northern Long-eared Bats to their day roosts in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. We compared tree and plot characteristics for roosts and corresponding random trees using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Our 43 survey nights yielded 302 bats of 11 species; Northern Long-eared Bats were the most commonly captured species (n = 97). We located 14 unique roosts for 7 radio-tracked bats; Pinus strobus (White Pine) snags (n = 8) were the most common roost sites. We observed a colony of 72 bats using a White Pine snag as a maternity roost. Roost trees were significantly larger in diameter and had more solar exposure above the roost and within the plot than random trees. Our data show the high abundance of Northern Long-eared Bats pre-WNS, highlight the use of White Pine roosts in an area impacted by a Dendroctonus frontalis (Southern Pine Beetle) outbreak, and support previous determinations of roost-selection flexibility by Northern Long-eared Bats across their range.",

To better assess the diversity of bats in the region, we conducted full-spectrum acoustic surveys at several sites in Yukon, Canada. During our surveys we obtained the 1st acoustic records of Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus) and Long-Legged Myotis (Myotis volans) in Yukon. Neither species had been documented previously in the territory, but one or both species were known from adjacent Alaska, British Columbia, and Northwest Territories. Characteristics of certain echolocation calls of Hoary Bats and Long-legged Myotis are difficult to confuse with other species that might also occur in the region. In addition, we made other noteworthy recordings; however, species identification for these other echolocation calls was ambiguous. These 1st records significantly increase our knowledge of the ranges of these bat species in Yukon, Canada. Further acoustic surveys, coupled with live captures, will help us further understand the diversity and distribution of bats in Yukon.",

We explored the importance of pollinator shifts in explaining ﬂoral divergence among 15 species of Iochroma. We examined four continuously varying ﬂoral traits: corolla length, nectar reward, display size, and ﬂower color. Pollinator associations were characterized with a continuously varying measure of pollinator importance (the product of visitation and pollen deposition) for four groups of pollinators: hummingbirds, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera. A phylogenetic generalized least squares approach was used to estimate correlations between pollinator groups and ﬂoral traits across a sample of Bayesian trees using different models of trait evolution. Multivariate analyses were also employed to identify suites of traits associated with each pollinator group. We found that nonphylogenetic models typically ﬁt the data better than phylogenetic models (Brownian motion, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck), and thus results varied little across trees. Our results indicated that species with high nectar reward and large displays are signiﬁcantly more likely to be pollinated by hummingbirds and less likely to be pollinated by all groups of insects. Corolla length and ﬂower color did not show any consistently signiﬁcant associations with pollinator groups. For these two traits, we discuss alternative evolutionary forces, including phylogenetic inertia and community-level factors.",

This study used auditory brainstem responses to measure temporal masking effects in the free-tailed bat, Tadarida brasiliensis. A digital subtraction protocol was used to isolate responses to the second of a pair of pulses varying in interval, revealing a suppression phase lasting <4 ms followed by an enhancement phase lasting 4–15 ms during which the ABR waveform was ampliﬁed up to 100%. The results suggest echolocating bats possess adaptations for enhancing sonar receiver gain shortly after pulse emission.",

In this work, we studied the pollination biology and the breeding system of\n              Harrisia portoricensis\n              , an island columnar cactus, to test for the presence of inbreeding and inbreeding depression. For\n              H. portoricensis\n              , which bears flowers with typical outcrossing morphology, the results from 322 h of direct observations and videotaping showed that visits to flowers by animals were uncommon. Controlled pollinations demonstrated that\n              H. portoricensis\n              has a partially self‐compatible breeding system that it is not autogamous and thus requires an external mechanism for the movement of pollen to set fruit. We detected differences in seed size, seed mass, germination success, and multiplicative fitness estimates between self‐ and cross‐pollination treatments. We found that progeny resulting from natural and self‐pollination treatments showed signs of inbreeding depression compared with progeny resulting from cross‐pollination; however, the magnitude of the inbreeding depression was less than 50%. Our combined results suggest that for this species an endogamous breeding system should be favored by natural selection.",

Seven species were recorded, of which three are new records for Rosario. One representative colony was chosen for intensive ecological study. ApproximateJy 64 000 Tadarida brasiJiensis forrned a matemity colony in the attic of an old building. Most of the bats were pregnant or lactat­ ing females and their young.. Adults arrive in the colony in mid-September and ¡eave in February, no bats were present at tbis site from the beginning of March to mid-September. Births occur between mid-November and mid-December. Pups roosted in compact c1usters in the nursery areas, spatially segregated from adults. Densities of these aggregations were 643 ± 76 bats/m2 (p < 0.20). and adult densitíes were 161 ± 21 bats/m2 (p < 0.20). 182 bats were captured. They were sexed and weighed. Mean adult females mass was, 13.26g before parturition and 12.01g after parturition. Recorded data inc1uded daily activity pattems.. Barn Owls (Tyto alba) and domes­ tic cats prey on bats leaving the colony. Rabies virus was no! detected. T he insect biological control exerted by this colony was estimated and it would be of 209 to 385 kg of insects nightly between September and late February, demonstrating the important role they play in the urban ecosistem.",

To examine the consequences of fragmentation and limited dispersal on patterns of genetic structure and variation, we used microsatellite markers to screen bats from around 50% of the known maternity colonies in Britain, and two areas from continental Europe. Analyses revealed that Welsh and English colonies were genetically isolated. This, and lower variability in Britain than north France, may result from either genetic drift, or the species’ colonization history. Gene ﬂow among most neighbouring colonies was not generally restricted, with one exception. These ﬁndings have important implications for the ongoing conservation management of this species.",

Protection improves with increasing knowledge of the biology and ecology of these species. However, species numbers rapidly increase with the ongoing description of cryptic species, resulting in a lack of ecological knowledge for each of these species. We studied the nutritional ecology of three cryptic bat species of the Myotis mystacinus group using stable isotope analysis and molecular fecal analysis. Inter- and intraspecific variations were compared by calculating the isotopic and dietary niches for each species. We hypothesized (a) that all three species are generalists, but (b) that M. mystacinus and Myotis brandtii are more similar to each other than to Myotis alcathoe. Third we assumed that the occupied niches are intraspecifically more similar than interspecifically. We could show that the members of the M. mystacinus group differ in their nutritional ecology. Our data suggest that M. alcathoe is the most specialized species of the group, occupying a more distinct ecological niche compared to the other two species. Interestingly, the dietary and isotopic niche overlap was higher interspecifically than intraspecifically. Furthermore, considering our findings and those from other studies we illustrate implications for the conservation of these cryptic species.",

This may be caused by higher parasite than host extinction rates or population declines, but lower parasite discovery effort has also been suggested.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    The Mexican free‐tailed bat\n                    Tadarida brasiliensis\n                    is one of the most common and widespread vertebrates in the Americas and host to the ectoparasite\n                    Primicimex cavernis\n                    , for which only 14 literature records from six sites worldwide exist.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Here, we confirm a much smaller parasite than host range. Two dedicated field trips revealed two new\n                    P. cavernis\n                    sites. In Texas, we found 87% out of eight sites negative for\n                    P. cavernis\n                    . However, this more likely reflects rarity than low discovery effort, because in one large population (>1000 individuals) in Sonora, putatively negative records occurred at only 31% of 16 sampling dates. Currently, live individuals of\n                    P. cavernis\n                    are known from only one cave in the United States and one in Mexico.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Protecting these existing sites is necessary to preserve this charismatic animal but it should not release us from aiming to discover new sites.",

The bat treated in vivo with ﬂutamide, an androgen antagonist, showed loss of spermatozoa at the storage site, utero-tubal junction. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis revealed the presence of increased expression of Bcl2 in the epithelial cell lining of the utero-tubal junction during the period of spermstorage. Treatment with testosterone in vitro caused a signiﬁcant dose-dependent increase in expression of the survival factor Bcl2, whereas treatment with ﬂutamide together with testosterone caused a signiﬁcant decline in Bcl2 in the utero-tubal junction of S. heathii. Together with the expression of Bcl2, the utero-tubal junction also expresses the death signal, caspase3. Expression of caspase3 decreased during January, but increased in February during the late stage of sperm storage. Androgen stimulated Bcl2 synthesis in the utero-tubal junction via the non-genomic MAP kinase signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study suggests that androgen promotes sperm storage in S. heathii by stimulating the survival factor Bcl2 in the utero-tubal junction. It is further hypothesized that a balance between the survival factor, Bcl2, and the death signal, caspase3, determines the duration of sperm storage in S. heathii.",

In order to understand how sperm storage in the female genital tract of the vespertilionid bat,\n                Scotophilus heathi\n                (Greater yellow bat), is controlled, we compared concentrations of glucose and the fatty‐acid carrier carnitine in the blood, and carnitine concentrations and levels of expression of the glucose transporters (GLUTs) and the carnitine transporter OCTN2 in the utero‐tubal junction of females during non‐storage (early winter) and sperm‐storage periods (late winter‐early spring). During the sperm‐storage period (December–January) blood glucose concentrations declined, as did the expression of GLUT3 and GLUT5 in the utero‐tubal junction. At the same time there were increases in the concentration of carnitine, and expression of OCTN2 and hormone‐sensitive lipase (HSL) in the utero‐tubal junction. These results suggest that prolonged sperm storage is enhanced by decreased glucose availability but increased free fatty acid availability at the site of sperm storage. Increases in expression of GLUT4 and GLUT8 in late winter suggest a role for these GLUTs in increasing sperm motility prior to fertilization. J. Exp.

The naming of these new taxa has important bearings in conservation, as this is the first step needed for them to be recognised by the scientific community but also legally. The naming of new animal species, however, needs to follow the strict rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature in order to be available and to provide a stable basis for further taxonomic research. We report here a case where new names have been improperly proposed to designate distinctive lineages in the Natterer's bat species complex. As these new names do not follow several mandatory rules imposed by the Code, they are declared unavailable and are not to be used for further taxonomy studies.",

Phylogenetic methods in combination with divergence time estimation can reveal biogeographical centres of origin, differentiate between hypotheses of vicariance and dispersal, and reveal the directionality of dispersal events. Despite their power, however, phylogenetic methods can sometimes yield patterns that are compatible with multiple, equally well-supported biogeographical hypotheses. In such cases, additional approaches must be integrated to differentiate among conflicting dispersal hypotheses. Here, we use a synthetic approach that draws upon the analytical strengths of coalescent and population genetic methods to augment phylogenetic analyses in order to assess the biogeographical history of Madagascar’s Triaenops bats (Chiroptera: Hipposideridae). Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data for Malagasy and east African Triaenops reveal a pattern that equally supports two competing hypotheses. While the phylogeny cannot determine whether Africa or Madagascar was the centre of origin for the species investigated, it serves as the essential backbone for the application of coalescent and population genetic methods. From the application of these methods, we conclude that a hypothesis of two independent but unidirectional dispersal events from Africa to Madagascar is best supported by the data.",

The evolution of this bat family considerably post-dated the tectonic division of Madagascar from Africa, excluding vicariance as a viable hypothesis. Therefore, we consider three biogeographical scenarios to explain these species’ current ranges: (A) a single dispersal from Africa to Madagascar with subsequent speciation of the Malagasy species; (B) multiple, unidirectional dispersals from Africa to Madagascar resulting in multiple, independent Malagasy lineages; or (C) early dispersal of a proto-species from Africa to Madagascar, with later back-dispersal of a descendant Malagasy taxon to Africa.",

Histoplasmosis is one of the most prevalent systemic mycoses in the Americas and occurs in several mammalian species. Bats are important in the epidemiological cycle of histoplasmosis because they disseminate the fungus throughout the environment. The aim of the present study was to investigate natural H. capsulatum infection in bats located in forested areas, which have undergone anthropogenic perturbations, as well as in the urban areas of the state of Pará. Twenty-two species of bats were captured in 18 municipalities of Pará; the samples obtained from these animals were subjected to nested PCR for amplification of H. capsulatum DNA. The HCI/HCII and HCIII/HCIV primers were used, and the final 210-pb fragment was amplified. Of the 100 bats analysed, two were confirmed to be positive for H. capsulatum. Samples amplified by nested PCR were sequenced and found to share identity and have 100% match with H. capsulatum DNA. H. capsulatum was detected in the area of study: the state of Pará has a wide diversity of bat species, and the region under investigation is situated in the north of the state, which suffers the most severe environmental and climatic changes. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the distribution of H. capsulatum hosts in this region to facilitate the implementation of effective disease surveillance.",

Switching behaviour was common to both sexes and did not depend on group size. We observed both individual and group switching, the latter often involving the abandonment of a roost tree on a single night. We suggest that behaviours such as flight activity around roosts or cavity inspection by bats play a role in recruiting group mates and coordinating their occupation of another site. Bats almost never crossed mountain ridges to use roosts located beyond them, possibly because ridges are regarded as boundaries delimiting main roosting areas. The rate of switching was lowest during the middle of the lactation period, probably to minimise problems related to the transportation of non‐volant young by their mothers. Although the maintenance of social relationship among bats spread over large forest areas may partly explain the occurrence of roost switching, the persistence of this behaviour in solitary bats and the movement of entire groups best fit the hypothesis that roost switching represents a way to maintain or increase knowledge of alternative roosts.",

Herein, we provide the first account on prevalence and phenology of P. destructans in Poland. Bats were counted once per month, from October or January to May (2010-2013), in an abandoned ore mine in southern Poland. Presence of P. destructans in two samples was confirmed by sequencing of isolated fungal DNA. Observations of phenotypically identical mycosis on bats hibernating at this site in March 2006 are likely to be the first known records of P. destructans from Poland. All Pd-suspected individuals were Myotis myotis with an exception of one Myotis daubentonii. The first Pd-suspected bats were noted in mid-February, but their number was the highest in March, what overlapped with maximum numbers of hibernating M. myotis. The prevalence in March was 7%-27% of M. myotis individuals. No mass mortality of bats was observed in the mine, with only three dead individuals found in the hibernaculum which hosted up to 130 bats, representing 6-7 species.",

            "abstractNote": "Hibernation is a strategy used by some mammals to survive harsh winter conditions. Many small mammals, such as the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, enter a long-term state of hibernation characterized by a period of deep torpor that can range from days to weeks. Torpid bats undergo metabolic rate depression that not only results in physiological changes but also promotes biochemical changes that favor survival. The present study utilizes multiplex technology to assess key early apoptosis markers and a select group of antioxidant enzymes in muscle, heart, and liver in euthermic controls and torpid bats. Muscle showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p53 and the antioxidant enzyme catalase but a signiﬁcant increase in peroxiredoxin 2 levels. The heart responded similarly, with most proapoptotic proteins (caspase 8/9 and p53) remaining at low levels, while the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein signiﬁcantly increased during torpor. There was no signiﬁcant change in the antioxidant enzymes measured during torpor in the heart compared with the controls. The liver showed increases in catalase and Mn superoxide dismutase 2 enzymes during torpor, which correlated with activation of select antiapoptotic proteins and suppression of levels of proapoptotic ones. Overall, our data demonstrate that antiapoptotic and antioxidant defense responses have organ-speciﬁc regulation during torpor in bats. The induction of key antioxidant enzymes and antiapoptotic proteins may function as protective mechanisms that are necessary for surviving torpor.",

For hoary bats, Lasiurus cinereus, their ecology is largely known from summer with the exception that they move long distances during autumn and spring and maintain some level of activity year-round. Autumn is a critically important period for hoary bats as they complete long-distance migrations between summer and winter range and they mate, both of which are energetically expensive. We studied hoary bat roost selection during autumn in a migratory stopover area in redwood habitat in northwestern California. We hypothesized that hoary bats select day roosts during autumn migration that minimize energetic expenditures and improve mating opportunities. We located 24 day roost sites of male hoary bats and evaluated site-level roost selection by comparing roosts with 120 random locations. We used multiple logistic regression to compare remotely sensed habitat features derived from LiDAR and other spatial data. The three most important variables for distinguishing roost from random locations were distance to creek, roads, and meadow. We speculate that selection of roosts in proximity to open spaces and flyways facilitated social behaviors related to mating that are commonly observed in this area.",

It evolved from a continental ancestor related to the Leisler’s bat Nyctalus leisleri and is considered threatened because of its restricted and highly fragmented distribution. We studied the genetic variability in 159 individuals from 14 colonies sampled throughout the archipelago. Sequences of the D-loop region revealed moderate but highly structured genetic variability. Half of the 15 distinct haplotypes were restricted to a single island, but the most common was found throughout the archipelago, suggesting a single colonization event followed by limited interisland female gene flow. All N. azoreum haplotypes were closely related and formed a star-like structure typical of expanded populations. The inferred age of demographic expansions was consistent with the arrival of founder animals during the Holocene, well before the first humans inhabited the Azores. Comparisons with a population of N. leisleri from continental Portugal confirmed not only that all N. azoreum lineages were unique to the archipelago, but also that the current levels of genetic diversity were surprisingly high for an insular species. Our data imply that the Azorean bat has a high conservation value. We argue that geographical patterns of genetic structuring indicate the existence of two management units.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are distributed worldwide from tropical to temperate regions. Despite their wide geographical radiation and advances in studies using evolutionary approaches, aspects related to the reproduction of these animals remain poorly explored, especially those related to the male reproductive accessory glands (RAGs). Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the morphophysiology of the male RAGs in the bat Artibeus lituratus. The RAGs in A. lituratus are composed of a compact intraabdominal glandular complex, consisting of the prostate with two prostatic regions (ventral and dorsal), plus Littre glands and a pair of extra-abdominal bulbourethral glands. The ventral region of the prostate has an epithelium with variable morphology, due to its holocrine type of secretion. In contrast, the dorsal region has a typical cubic-to-columnar pseudostratified epithelium. Both regions contain two cell types, basal and secretory cells. Similar to the epithelial morphology, the secretion also varies, with the ventral region containing numerous PAS-positive globular vesicles, whereas the dorsal region has a more fluid, hyaline and PAS-negative secretion. Littre glands are dispersed in the connective tissue of the urethra, while the bulbourethral glands are located in the penile root, both glands with cubic-to-columnar pseudostratified epithelium and globular PASpositive secretion. The results demonstrate that the RAGs of A. lituratus are composed of two prostatic regions, ventral and dorsal, and urethral and bulbourethral glands, with no seminal vesicles. Each prostatic region has unique and distinctive characteristics, with the ventral region presenting an exclusive holocrine nature and the dorsal region having similarities to the ventral prostate of rodents.",

This sequence was placed with Vespertilio sinensis (Asian parti-colored bat) in a COI gene tree but with Hypsugo alashanicus (Alashanian pipistrelle) in a cytochrome b gene tree. Direct comparison of mitogenomes showed that 92.4% of this mitogenome is similar to Vespertilio sinensis, 5.9% to Hypsugo alaschanicus, and that 1.6% of the mitogenome could not be attributed to either species, or any other species. This mitogenome has been re-used in at least 17 phylogenies. Our findings suggest that mitogenomes are best verified with multiple gene trees, followed by direct comparison of sequences. We conclude that greater vigilance is warranted to ensure that problematic sequences do not enter the scientific record, and are not re-used in subsequent studies.",

            "abstractNote": "Artibeus lituratus is a frugivorous bat that directly assists in the restoration of degraded habitats through the effective dispersion of seeds and fruits. Given its great importance, this work aimed to evaluate the uterine hormonal control of A. lituratus during its different reproductive phases. The uteri of 30 sexually mature adult females, five specimens for each of the six sample groups (NON, nonreproductive; P1, initial pregnancy; P2, intermediate pregnancy; P3, advanced pregnancy; LAC, lactating; P + LAC, pregnant-lactating), were submitted to analyses of serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations, in addition to immunohistochemical analyses. Both estradiol and progesterone, gradually increased during pregnancy, with a marked significant increase in P3 females. Both returned to low levels in LAC-females; however, estradiol levels decreased further in P + LAC-females, while progesterone increased in the same group. In general, signs indicative of aromatase expression were observed in the endometrium of all analyzed groups and in the placenta of bats in the gestation groups. Similarly, ERα and PR were expressed in the myometrium, endometrium and placenta at varying levels of intensity. The results indicate that the uterine microenvironment of A. lituratus is directly regulated by serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone, and fluctuations in these concentrations control morphological and physiological changes of this organ during different phases of the reproductive cycle.",
