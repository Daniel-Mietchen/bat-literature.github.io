The host specimen, a little known molossid bat (Myopterus whitleyi), constitutes the first record of this species in CAR. The new flea species appears taxonomically close to A. hetera Beaucournu & Fain, 1982, one of the two other Allopsylla species, previously know from other faunal regions (A. alloides in Nigeria and A. hetera in Democratic Republic of the Congo). The parasitism of three distinctly different hosts by the three known Allopsylla species raises questions regarding the hostparasite specificity of this group.",

In the present study we analyzed the diet of the bat Anoura caudifer at the southernmost limit of its geographic distribution, the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil. We identified food items and plant species consumed by A. caudifer and tested the hypothesis that its diet varies seasonally. We collected fecal material monthly from October 2003 to September 2004 in a day roost of A. caudifer. We obtained a total of 1,166 fecal samples: 1,029 (88%) samples contained pollen, 592 (51%) contained insects, and 196 (17%) contained seeds. The hypothesis that diet varies seasonally was corroborated. There was high consumption of nectar and pollen in all seasons, especially in spring (98%), high consumption of insects mainly in summer and autumn (60%), and high consumption of fruits in winter (41%) and summer (24%). Anoura caudifer consumed pollen and nectar of 10 plant species, mainly of Marcgravia polyantha, and fruits of six species, mainly of Piper gaudichaudianum. Anoura caudifer has primarily a pollinivorous/insectivorous diet at the southern limit of its distribution, and, in contrast to other studies, it also eats fruits at some times of the year. Visits to flowers of 10 species, four of which not matching the syndrome of chiropterophily, and consumption of fruits of six species indicate a generalistic behavior of A. caudifer in the study area. This flexibility may have been crucial to the maintenance of A. caudifer populations at the southern limit of its distribution, and also for the persistence of batpollinated plants in local ecosystems.",

The objective of this study was to construct a phylogeny using DNA sequence data from 2 mitochondrial loci (cytochrome-b [Cytb] and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase subunit 1 [ND1]) and 1 nuclear locus (b-ﬁbrinogen intron 7 [bFib]) for members of Eumops and outgroups from the family Molossidae. Data for each locus were analyzed separately using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods and combined for complete data analyses using Bayesian inference and Bayesian concordance analysis on a total of 2,715 base pairs. The monophyly of Eumops was signiﬁcantly supported in all analyses and molecular dating estimated a most recent common ancestor of the genus at approximately 15.7 million years ago. Placement of E. hansae was problematic, with ND1 analyses supporting a sister relationship with E. patagonicus and E. nanus, whereas Cytb and bFib analyses placed this species as a basal lineage in the genus. Analysis of all genes recovered E. hansae as a poorly supported basal lineage with E. patagonicus and E. nanus as sister to the remaining species. These 3 major lineages of Eumops diverged during the mid-Miocene.",

Echolocation signals were recorded in the ﬁeld in south-eastern Moravia and northern Bohemia (Czech Republic) and in an ad hoc experimental laboratory. For each of the species, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated signiﬁcant differences in calls produced inside the experimental room and in the open. Paired t-tests and MANOVA were also used to reveal inﬂuences of interindividual contacts in each of the cryptic species on the spectral patterns of call variables. Differences were found in the spectral variables of echolocation calls of an individual ﬂying in the room alone and in a group of conspeciﬁcs. The possibility that bats use their ﬂexibility to avoid mutual disturbances of echolocation calls was tested. We found that bats ﬂying in a group modify the parameters of their echolocation signals according to the presence of other individuals of the same species. These differences can indicate jamming avoidance and recognition of own echoes. However, they did not change the parameters if individuals of another species were present. Social calls are more numerous when bats ﬂy in a mixedspecies group than in a monospeciﬁc group.",

The phenology of display and swarming behaviour were studied using bat detectors and mist nettings in the ruins of Nový Hrádek castle (southwestern Moravia, Czech Republic), where P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus hibernate in mixed-species clusters. We hypothesize that if both pipistrelle species share the same swarming site and hibernaculum they can compete with each other and their mating and courtship activity can be separate over time. The highest songflight activity was found between mid-August and mid-September. At the beginning of the mating period, songflights of both species were recorded in the second third of the night, whereas from the end of September, the peak of display activity moved to the first third of the night. We did not find clear evidence for temporal niche partitioning between species during autumn mating behaviour at locality of study. Proportion of P. pygmaeus observed in the hibernaculum was significantly higher than its observed in acoustic recordings and in mist-netted bats. It may show different mating behaviour between both pipistrelle species. Males of P. pipistrellus produced display calls close to hibernacula, whereas males of P. pygmaeus probably mate elsewhere, likely before any long autumnal migration near nursery colonies.",

This data extends its distribution range in Central Europe and confirms it as a native breeding species in Poland. Specific identification of bats was confirmed by sequencing ND1 gene of mtDNA. In Poland its reproduction has been recorded in Łężczok reserve, Silesian Foothill and in Roztocze National Park. Bats were observed mostly within old broadleaved and mixed forests, near water, at altitude ranging from 112 to 736 m a.s.l. The only known roosting site for the species is a cave which is used both in spring and during the swarming period. In Poland the species co-occurred with both M. brandtii and M. mystacinus or with M. brandtii at all sites.",

Bats have a long-standing reputation for being highly sensitive to stressors, with sensitivity and resilience varying both within and among species, yet little is known about how stress affects the signaling that regulates reproductive physiology. Here, we provide the first description of the molecular response of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis of male big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in response to short-term stress using a standardized restraint manipulation. This acute stressor was sufficient to upregulate plasma corticosterone and resulted in a rapid decrease in circulating testosterone. While we did not find differences in the mRNA expression of key steroidogenic enzymes (StAR, aromatase, 5-alpha reductase), seminiferous tubule diameter was reduced in stressed bats coupled with a 5-fold increase in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression in the testes. These changes, in part, may be mediated by RFamide-related peptide (RFRP) because fewer immunoreactive cell bodies were detected in the brains of stressed bats compared with controls – suggesting a possible increase in secretion – and increased RFRP expression locally in the gonads. The rapid sensitivity of the bat testes to stress may be connected to deleterious impacts on tissue health and function as supported by significant transcriptional upregulation of key pro-apoptotic signaling molecules (Bax, cytochrome c). Experiments like this broadly contribute to our understanding of the stronger ecological predictions regarding physiological responses of bats within the context of stress, which may impact decisions surrounding animal handling and conservation approaches.",

            "abstractNote": "In Argentina, the study of feeding habits of bats was practically restricted to frugivorous species, whereas data on the insectivorous bat diet was scarce and anecdotal. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the diet of Tadarida brasiliensis along the Yungas Forest, Argentina, at sites with different degrees of disturbance. Through the analysis of feces, arthropod orders were identified, volume and frequency of occurrence were estimated for each food item, and the niche breadth was estimated for the species. Finally, the diet was compared between capture sites, sexes, and seasons; finding variations among sites and seasons. The diet of T. brasiliensis contains arthropods belonging to nine orders and one undetermined taxon. Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera represent the highest volume proportions in the diet. The results add new and important information about the biology of T. brasiliensis in the southern part of its distribution.",

Samples were classified in nine groups to avoid seasonal and geographical bias. Individual differences (studied only in females) identified one dominant plant species by locality, but with exceptions, suggesting individual opportunistic or feeding preferences. For sexual differences a \"Gw\" test (with William´s correction) was applied; four bat groups have important differences, four groups have minor differences and in one group, male and female diets were similar.",

            "abstractNote": "The vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) is a haematophagous animal that feeds exclusively on the blood of domestic mammals. Vampire bat feeding habits enable their contact with mammalian hosts and may enhance zoonotic spillover. Moreover, they may carry several pathogenic organisms, including coronaviruses (CoVs), for which they are important hosts. The human pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and possibly coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) all originated in bats but required bridge hosts to spread into human populations. To monitor the presence of potential zoonotic viruses in bats, the present work evaluated the presence of CoVs in vampire bats from southern Brazil. A total of 101 vampire bats were captured and euthanized between 2017 and 2019 in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and intestines were collected and macerated individually. The samples were pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and subsequently individually screened using a pancoronavirus RTPCR protocol. We detected CoV-related sequences in HTS, but only two (2/101; 1.98%) animals had CoV detected in the intestines by RT-PCR. Partial sequences of RdRp and spike genes were obtained in the same sample and the RdRp region in the other sample. The sequences were classified as belonging to Alphacoronavirus. The sequences were closely related to alphacoronaviruses detected in vampire bats from Peru. The continuous monitoring of bat CoVs may help to map and predict putative future zoonotic agents with great impacts on human health.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats are the only mammals capable of powered flight. One of the oldest bats known from a complete skeleton is\n              Onychonycteris finneyi\n              from the Early Eocene (Green River Formation, Wyoming, 52.5 Ma). Estimated to weigh approximately 40 g,\n              Onychonycteris\n              exhibits the most primitive combination of characters thus far known for bats. Here, we reconstructed the aerofoil of the two known specimens, calculated basic aerodynamic variables and compared them with those of extant bats and gliding mammals.\n              Onychonycteris\n              appears in the edges of the morphospace for bats, underscoring the primitive conformation of its flight apparatus. Low aerodynamic efficiency is inferred for this extinct species as compared to any extant bat. When we estimated aerofoil variables in a model of\n              Onychonycteris\n              excluding the handwing, it closely approached the morphospace of extant gliding mammals. Addition of a handwing to the model lacking this structure results in a 2.3-fold increase in aspect ratio and a 28% decrease in wing loading, thus greatly enhancing aerodynamics. In the context of these models, the rapid evolution of the chiropteran handwing via genetically mediated developmental changes appears to have been a key transformation in the hypothesized transition from gliding to flapping in early bats.",

Among the metabolic effects in mammals caused by fenthion, hyperglycemia occurs via the activation of hepatic metabolic pathways, which may interfere with the function of several organs and systems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute and sub-chronic levels of fenthion on energy metabolism and liver morphology of frugivorous bats (Artibeus lituratus), which usually feed on fruits cultivated on South American plantations where fenthion is used. Animals were fed fruit treated with fenthion by immersion of fruit in a solution containing fenthion (500 ppm) and an adhesive spreader (200 ppm). Blood glucose levels did not change due to fenthion treatment, but muscle glycogen content increased and carcass fatty acids decreased after acute exposure. An increase in hepatocyte cell diameter further characterized as an increase in vacuolization was observed. The results indicate that fenthion may affect some components of energy metabolism and promote alterations in hepatocyte morphology in frugivorous bats when applied to cultivated fruits at the recommended rates.",

Previous analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data resulted in paraphyly of these two species. Our objective was to examine genetic differences in nuclear loci between M. californicus and M. ciliolabrum, investigate their relationship with M. leibii, and to address the conflicting morphological and mtDNA data sets. We analyzed 198 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fragments from 17 M. californicus, 16 M. ciliolabrum, and 10 M. leibii using principal coordinate (PCoA), neighbor-joining, Bayesian, and parsimony analyses. Our analyses recovered well-supported separation of M. californicus and M. ciliolabrum based on nuclear markers, suggesting the failure of the mitochondrial markers to recover monophyletic lineages was due to a lack of lineage sorting. Unexpectedly, M. ciliolabrum was paraphyletic with respect to M. leibii individuals from the eastern United States. In conclusion, our analysis of nuclear AFLP markers recovered distinct genetic lineages or clusters that corresponded to the recognized species defined by morphology, M. californicus, M. ciliolabrum, and M. leibii. We propose that these divergences are somewhat incomplete and the divergence between M. ciliolabrum and M. leibii occurred more recently than the speciation events separating the currently sympatric species M. californicus and M. ciliolabrum.",

            "abstractNote": "Resource selection by animals inﬂuences ecological processes such as dispersal, reproduction, foraging, and migration. Little information exists regarding foraging resource selection by bats during the maternity season. We evaluated support for effects of landcover type, landform, and landscape pattern on resource selection by individual foraging female eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis) during the maternity period and compared resource utilization for all individuals pooled (population level), individuals grouped by geographic location, and individuals grouped by stage of lactation (early, mid, and late). We used a resource utilization function (RUF) to relate landcover and landscape attributes to the utilization distributions of individual bats estimated by the ﬁxed-kernel method. We radio-tracked 64 lactating red bats and estimated utilization distributions for 52 individuals. Mean home range size ranged from 1,041 to 1,588 ha from late to mid lactation. The global RUF model was signiﬁcantly better than the null RUF model for 36 (70%) individuals and the magnitude and direction of coefﬁcients varied among individuals. Resource utilization at the population level was, on average, positively related to ridges and upland drainage landforms, water landcover, and road density; and negatively related to urban and nonforest landcover and distance to edge. Resource use differed between geographic areas by canopy cover, water landcover, and road density. Canopy closure was positively related to RUF in both areas but was greater in the south area. Percent water negatively related to RUF in the north area and positively related in the south area. Road density had a positive relationship in the north and negative relationship in the south with RUF. We did not ﬁnd a difference in mean RUF coefﬁcients among lactation groups except for canopy cover. On average, canopy cover had a positive effect on use by bats during early and mid-lactation but a negative effect during late lactation. We suggest that management for red bats consider landscape components and provide a range of composition and structural diversity to enhance foraging use by red bats. In highly forested landscapes, gaps or openings may provide forest edges that are important for foraging and commuting. Published 2014.

Nectar features in relation to the main pollinators have seldom been studied in this genus. To test the hypothesis of ﬂoral adaptation to both diurnal and nocturnal pollinators, we studied the pollination ecology of Inga sessilis, with emphasis on the nectar secretion patterns, effects of sequential removals on nectar production, sugar composition and the role of diurnal and nocturnal pollinators in its reproductive success. Inga sessilis is self-incompatible and pollinated by hummingbirds, hawkmoths and bats. Fruit set under natural conditions is very low despite the fact that most stigmas receive polyads with sufﬁcient pollen to fertilise all ovules in a ﬂower. Nectar secretion starts in the bud stage and ﬂowers continually secreting nectar for a period of 8 h. Flowers actively reabsorbed the nectar a few hours before senescence. Sugar production increased after nectar removal, especially when ﬂowers were drained during the night. Nectar sugar composition changed over ﬂower life span, from sucrose-dominant (just after ﬂower opening, when hummingbirds were the main visitors) to hexose-rich (throughout the night, when bats and hawkmoths were the main visitors). Diurnal pollinators contributed less than nocturnal ones to fruit production, but the former were more constant and reliable visitors through time. Our results indicate I. sessilis has ﬂoral adaptations, beyond the morphology, that encompass both diurnal and nocturnal pollinator requirements, suggesting a complementary and mixed pollination system.",

Dietary items were identified from 1,470 samples of fecal and ejecta pellets which had been collected under day roosts or from captured bats over a 2‐year period (2014–2015).\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Plant phenology studies illustrated strong seasonal correlations between fruiting and flowering and rainfall patterns: Fruits were available throughout the year but with peaks of abundance during the rainy season, while flowers were mostly abundant during the dry season.\n                    Epomophorus gambianus\n                    bats utilized fruit and flower resources from 30 plant species. Although the plant species used depended on seasonal availability, there were clear preferences for certain species.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Flowers were an important food source for this fruit bat species especially during the dry season, contributing up to 79% of dietary items when fruit abundance was low. Ficus fruits were also important food item for\n                    E. gambianus\n                    , constituting over 40% of all dietary samples identified.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Policy implications\n                    . Our results show the importance of flowers in the diet of\n                    E. gambianus\n                    and highlight this species as an important pollinator and seed disperser, including for economically and ecologically important plant species. These findings contribute to an improved understanding of the ecological importance and potential role of this species in the forest‐savannah transition ecosystem for the development of fruit bat conservation management strategies.",

            "abstractNote": "The western red bat (Lasiurus blossevillii) is a foliage-roosting species of riparian habitats in arid regions of the southwestern United States. Only limited published anecdotal observations exist for roost sites used by this species. Western red bats were split taxonomically from the eastern red bat (Lasiurus borealis) in 1988, but summaries of roosting behaviors for western red bats still appear to stem from former associations with the commonly studied eastern red bat. Our study represents the first comprehensive research on the roosting ecology of western red bats. We radio-tracked 14 adult bats to 19 different day roosts along the Mimbres River of southwestern New Mexico. While we documented that western red bats had an affinity for densely foliated trees (79%), we did not detect any selection for tree species or size. At our study site, western red bats roosted in cottonwoods (47%, Populus spp.), velvet ash (21%, Fraxinus velutina), box elder (16%, Acer negundo), and red mulberry (16%, Morus rubra). We also described clustering behavior, where groups of 2–3 adults roosted in direct contact with one another. Although the species was deemed to roost solitarily, the frequency of clustering behavior in our study suggests otherwise. If bats were observed in clusters, they typically exhibited greater roosting fidelity than solitary individuals. Because arid riparian corridors in the southwestern United States generally are considered threatened systems, protection and preservation of mechanisms that create and maintain the diversity of these riparian corridors is necessary for the survival of this uncommon and poorly understood species.",

The nematode was found only in subcutaneous tissues near the plantar surface of the rear feet of the host. The genus Maseria is distinguished from other genera in Muspiceidae by various morphological characteristics, among which the presence of a Demanian system is important. The lesions produced in the feet of the host are described, and other biological characteristics of the nematode are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "DNA transposons, or class 2 transposable elements, have successfully propagated in a wide variety of genomes. However, it is widely believed that DNA transposon activity has ceased in mammalian genomes for at least the last 40 million years. We recently reported evidence for the relatively recent activity of\n              hAT\n              and\n              Helitron\n              elements, two distinct groups of DNA transposons, in the lineage of the vespertilionid bat\n              Myotis lucifugus\n              . Here, we describe seven additional families that have also been recently active in the bat lineage. Early vespertilionid genome evolution was dominated by the activity of\n              Helitron\n              s,\n              mariner\n              -like and\n              Tc2\n              -like elements. This was followed by the colonization of\n              Tc1\n              -like elements, and by a more recent explosion of\n              hAT\n              -like elements. Finally, and most recently,\n              piggyBac\n              -like elements have amplified within the\n              Myotis\n              genome and our results indicate that one of these families is probably still expanding in natural populations. Together, these data suggest that there has been tremendous recent activity of various DNA transposons in the bat lineage that far exceeds those previously reported for any mammalian lineage. The diverse and recent populations of DNA transposons in genus\n              Myotis\n              will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the impact of this class of elements on mammalian genome evolution and to better understand what makes some species more susceptible to invasion by genomic parasites than others.",

It can be concluded that. although there are differences in some parameters between regions, calls are similar overall in the five geographic regions investigated, and that the slight geographic variation which does occur does not confound the identification of C. gouldii.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            Auditory thalamocortical connections are organized as parallel pathways originating in various nuclei of the medial geniculate body (MGB). The development of these pathways has not been studied. Therefore it remains unclear whether thalamocortical connections segregate before the onset of hearing or whether refinement of exuberant thalamocortical connections occurs following hearing onset. We studied this issue in the pallid bat. In adult pallid bats, parallel thalamocortical pathways represent two different sounds used in two different behaviors. The suprageniculate (SG) nucleus of the dorsal division of the MGB (MGBd) projects to a high‐frequency cortical region selective for the echolocation calls, but not to a low‐frequency cortical region sensitive to noise transients used in the localization of prey. Conversely, the ventral division (MGBv) projects to the low‐frequency, but not the high‐frequency, cortical region. Here we studied the development of these parallel pathways. Based on retrograde tracer injections in electrophysiologically characterized cortical loci, we show that there is an asymmetrical overlap in projection patterns from postnatal (P) day 15–60. The low‐frequency region receives extensive input from both the SG and the MGBv. In contrast, the high‐frequency region receives the great majority of its input from the SG, as in adults, whereas projections from the MGBv appear to make only a minor contribution, if any. By P150, these pathways are segregated and adult‐like. These data suggest that these anatomically segregated pathways arise through postnatal refinement of initially overlapping connections. J. Comp.

Despite the lack of consensus among researchers as to whether bats are important predators of mosquitoes, there have been no attempts to directly document the effect of bats on mosquito populations or behavior. We conducted an enclosure experiment to test the hypothesis that bats reduce the local abundance of ovipositing female mosquitoes by examining whether the northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis Trouessart) had an effect on Culex spp. (Diptera: Culicidae) oviposition, using naturally occurring mosquitoes, either through direct predation or trait mediated effects on mosquito behavior. We found a signiÞcant, 32% reduction in egg-laying activity associated with bat predation. ArtiÞcial oviposition habitats directly outside bat enclosures experienced no reduction in oviposition; we attributed the observed reduction in egg-laying activity to direct predation on ovipositing females by bats and not changes in mosquito behavior. In addition, we noted a decrease in the number of larval mosquitoes in enclosures exposed to bat predation. These results suggest the impact of aerial predators on pathogen transmission may be large, and warrants further scientiÞc investigation.",

Cooler weather during June 2001 coincided with a median birth date that was 8 days later than in 2000, whilst the difference between colonies was 4 and 5 days, respectively, for the pooled data of both years. Cool temperatures in June also coincided with a longer duration of the parturition period. Postnatal growth rates were higher than in most other bat species but differences between years and colonies were considerable. These differences may be attributed to the ambient roost temperatures, whereby the young of two cooler roosts showed signiﬁcantly reduced growth rate during 8 days of cool weather in 2000. Moreover, later born and therefore smaller pups were more strongly affected by low temperatures than earlier born and larger ones. The mean length of forearm of young lesser horseshoe bats at the beginning of September equalled that of adult bats, whilst their body mass was still lower. Non-volant juveniles did not cluster following the nightly emergence of adult females, and a preferred location within the roosts could not be identiﬁed. High and very low roost temperatures, however, did have an inﬂuence on the location of non-volant young in the colonies.",

Animals were maintained in a breeding colony in captivity. High levels of both cortisol and corticosterone were detected, with total plasma GC levels being among the highest documented in vertebrates (up to 3000 ng/ml in individual animals, with cortisol being the primary GC, accounting for E78% of total GCs), and signiﬁcantly greater in males than in females. Plasma levels of cortisol and corticosterone showed nearly identical proﬁles within each sex, with the exception of females in late pregnancy, in which corticosterone, but not cortisol, increased signiﬁcantly. Baseline levels of plasma cortisol were highest in September (when pups were between 1 and 2 months of age) in both sexes, which may be related to the approaching onset of the mating period. There was a continuum in the magnitude of the response to stress (handling and sampling) over time in females, with the greatest stress response in early pregnancy, a dampened response during late pregnancy, and no signiﬁcant stress response during lactation. Surprisingly, males failed to exhibit elevated GCs after this stress, but did have signiﬁcant stress-induced hyperglycemia and suppression of plasma testosterone levels. This may be due to their high (perhaps maximal) baseline levels, which suggests that being in a breeding group was chronically stressful for males. J. Exp.

            "abstractNote": "White nose syndrome (WNS) is caused by the psychrophilic fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans that can grow in the environment saprotrophically or parasitically by infecting hibernating bats. Infections are pathological in many species of North American bats, disrupting hibernation and causing mortality. To determine what fungal pathways are involved in infection of living tissue, we examined fungal gene expression using RNA-Seq. We compared P. destructans gene expression when grown in culture to that during infection of a North American bat species, Myotis lucifugus, that shows high WNS mortality. Cultured P. destructans was grown at 10 to 14 C and P. destructans growing in vivo was presumably exposed to temperatures ranging from 4 to 8 C during torpor and up to 37 C during periodic arousals. We found that when P. destructans is causing WNS, the most signiﬁcant differentially expressed genes were involved in heat shock responses, cell wall remodeling, and micronutrient acquisition. These results indicate that this fungal pathogen responds to host-pathogen interactions by regulating gene expression in ways that may contribute to evasion of host responses. Alterations in fungal cell wall structures could allow P. destructans to avoid detection by host pattern recognition receptors and antibody responses. This study has also identiﬁed several fungal pathways upregulated during WNS infection that may be candidates for mitigating infection pathology. By identifying hostspeciﬁc pathogen responses, these observations have important implications for host-pathogen evolutionary relationships in WNS and other fungal diseases.",

Wildlife is often disturbed by these largely unpredictable activities, and animals may have limited opportunities to adapt. Mountain hares\n                    Lepus timidus\n                    are affected by this increase in alpine tourism, but their physiological and behavioural reactions to tourist activity are still unknown.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We measured the levels of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (\n                    GCM\n                    ) in wild mountain hares living in areas that had no, medium or high levels of tourist activity during winter in 2011. Furthermore, we compared the changes in\n                    GCM\n                    excretion, behaviour and food intake of six captive mountain hares following predator challenge experiments from early to mid‐winter.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Our field results showed that\n                    GCM\n                    excretion is positively correlated with increased tourism intensity. In the predator challenge experiments, hares spent less time resting and grooming (including re‐ingesting faecal pellets) during and after the stress treatments. These stress events lead to higher energy demands due to flushing, increased\n                    GCM\n                    levels, and disrupted the energy intake that hares derive from faeces.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We conclude that mountain hares living in areas with frequent human winter recreational activities show changes in physiology and behaviour that demand additional energy in winter, when access to food resources is limited by snow.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Synthesis and applications\n                    .

            "abstractNote": "White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an emerging disease causing massive mortality of hibernating bats in the northeastern United States. At hibernacula, bats affected with WNS typically exhibit growth of a white psychrophylic fungus (Geomyces destructans) on the nose, wings and ears; many individuals seem to prematurely die of starvation owing to depleted fat reserves. Conspicuous scarring and necrosis of the wings on WNS-affected bats that survive hibernation may have lasting consequences for survival and reproductive success during the active season. We monitored two maternity colonies of little brown myotis, Myotis lucifugus, in Massachusetts and New Hampshire from 14 May to 8 August 2008 to assess body conditions after expected exposure to WNS over the previous winter. We developed a 4-point wing damage index (WDI = 0 to 3) to assess the incidence and severity of wing damage in the months following emergence from hibernation. Severe wing damage was observed up to 4 June and moderate damage was observed through 9 July. Light wing damage was observed on both adult and juvenile bats throughout the study period, but was not exclusively attributed to WNS. The most severe wing damage was associated with a lower body mass index which may reflect reduced foraging success. Overall, reproductive rate was 85.1% in 2008; slightly lower than reported in previous studies. The incidence, timing, and geographic range of wing damage observed on little brown myotis in 2008 correspond to the occurrence of WNS at hibernacula. Monitoring wing conditions of affected and healthy bats will be important tool for assessing the spread of this disease and for establishing baseline data for unaffected bats. The simple scale we propose should be useful for monitoring wing conditions in any bat species.",

            "abstractNote": "The Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) exhibits a highly vascularized, hairless thermal window (or ‘‘radiator’’) on the proximal ventral surfaces of extended wings and body. We identified this character using thermal infrared imaging and investigated the vasculature using barium sulfate enhanced microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). Micro-CT images revealed unique arrangements of arteries and veins in the region of the radiator positioned perpendicular to the axis of the body. Coupling micro-CT imaging with analysis of surface temperature profiles, we concluded that radiators aid in thermoregulation during flight in variable environments. This study represents the first application of contrast enhanced micro-CT to visualize vasculature of bats and thus exhibits a promising technique for further investigations of cardiovascular function and anatomy in bats.

            "abstractNote": "To investigate the impact of short summers and long summer solar periods at high latitudes on the behavior of a nocturnal, hibernating mammal, we recorded the phenology of Myotis lucifugus (little brown myotis) at 60  N in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada. In particular, we assessed the timing of spring emergence from, and autumn entry into, hibernation, reproduction, and seasonal mass fluctuations. We used a combination of acoustic monitoring and capture surveys at two hibernacula and two maternity roosts during 2011 and 2012. Myotis spp. were active at the hibernacula from late April to late September/early October, suggesting that the “active” season length is similar to that of populations farther south. At maternity colonies, we detected M. lucifugus activity from early May to early October, with peaks during mid-July in both years. Lactation, fledging, and weaning all occurred later in the NWT than at more southern locations, and reproductive rates were significantly lower than rates observed farther south. The average mass of individuals fluctuated throughout the season, with an initial decline immediately following emergence from hibernation likely reflecting increased energy expenditure due to flight and decreased use of torpor, coupled with relatively low prey intake due to low prey abundance associated with cool temperatures. Females did not appear to have lower pre-hibernation masses than those in more southern populations, suggesting that despite the cool spring and autumn temperatures, and short summer nights, bats are able to obtain enough energy for reproduction and mass accumulation for hibernation. However, the lower reproductive rates may indicate that there are limitations to life at the northern limits of the species’ range.",

            "abstractNote": "The vast majority of trypanosome species is vector-borne parasites, with some of them being medically and veterinary important (such as Trypanosoma cruzi and Trypanosoma brucei) and capable of causing serious illness in vertebrate hosts. The discovery of trypanosomes in bats emphasizes the importance of bats as an important reservoir. Interestingly, there is a hypothesis that bats are ancestral hosts of T. cruzi. Trypanosome diversity has never been investigated in bats in Thailand, despite being in a biodiversity hot spot. To gain a better understanding of the diversity and evolutionary relationship of trypanosomes, polymerase chain reaction-based surveys were carried out from 2018 to 2020 in 17 sites. A total of 576 bats were captured, representing 23 species. A total of 38 (6.6%) positive samples was detected in ten bat species. Trypanosoma dionisii and Trypanosoma noyesi were identified from Myotis siligorensis and Megaderma spasma, respectively. The remaining 18S rRNA sequences of trypanosomes were related to other trypanosomes previously reported elsewhere. The sequences in the current study showed nucleotide identity as low as 90.74% compared to those of trypanosomes in the GenBank database, indicating the possibility of new species. All bat trypanosomes identified in the current study fall within the T. cruzi clade. The current study adds to evidence linking T. noyesi to a bat trypanosome and further supports the bat host origin of the T. cruzi clade. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first study on bat trypanosomes in Thailand and their phylogenetic relationships with global isolates.",

            "abstractNote": "Amphibians are experiencing a panzootic of unprecedented proportions caused by the emergence of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). However, all species are not equally at risk of infection, and risk is further modified by environmental variables, specifically temperature. In order to understand how, and when, hosts mount a response to Bd we analysed infection dynamics and patterns of gene expression in the model amphibian species Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis. Mathematical modelling of infection dynamics demonstrate the existence of a temperature-dependent protective response that is largely independent of the intrinsic growth-rate of Bd. Using temporal expression-profiling by microarrays and qRT-PCR, we characterise this response in the main amphibian lymphoid tissue, the spleen. We demonstrate that clearance of Bd at the host-optimal temperature is not clearly associated with an adaptive immune response, but rather is correlated with the induction of components of host innate immunity including the expression of genes that are associated with the production of the antimicrobial skin peptide preprocareulein (PPCP) as well as inflammatory responses. We find that adaptive immunity appears to be lacking at host-optimal temperatures. This suggests that either Bd does not stimulate, or suppresses, adaptive immunity, or that trade-offs exist between innate and adaptive limbs of the amphibian immune system. At cold temperatures, S. tropicalis loses the ability to mount a PPCP-based innate response, and instead manifests a more pronounced inflammatory reaction that is characterised by the production of proteases and higher pathogen burdens. This study demonstrates the temperature-dependency of the amphibian response to infection by Bd and indicates the influence that changing climates may exert on the ectothermic host response to pathogens.",

            "abstractNote": "We presented a comparative study of two species of South American bats, Myotis albescens and Eumops patagonicus, about prenatal development. This study was carried out using 60 specimens, which were measured and photographed, and the embryonic stage was assigned by the staging system for Carollia perspicillata. We observed that the chorionic vesicle showed similarities in the disposition of the extraembryonic membranes, but they differed in characteristics of their yolk sac; in E. patagonicus, it was more glandular than M. albescens. M. albescens presented a well-developed discoid placenta with a caudal antimesometrial position, but E. patagonicus presented a diffuse placenta, which persists until the end of gestation and a discoid placenta in the uterus–tubal junction. In the embryogenesis, early stages, middle stages, and late stages were deﬁned. In the early stage, the embryonic morphology is similar in the two species. The middle stage is characterized by the muzzle and pinna formation, fore and hind limb regionalization, and the formation of the patagium primordium. In the late stage, the overall growth of the embryo occurs. Its fore and hind limbs, patagium, and the typical craniofacial features are conﬁgured. We conclude that in early stages of development, the embryonic morphology of M. albescens and E. patagonicus is similar, while in late stages differences are evident; mainly the craniofacial structures and uropatagium conﬁguration characteristics that allow their classiﬁcation at the family level. Moreover, differences in time of fusion of maxillary and mandibular process were registered. This could be related to the morphology of the muzzle of each species.

Seasonal changes in hormone activity affect metabolism, body temperature, and reproductive activity. We examined the seasonal regulatory role of hormones on basal metabolic rate (BMR) and regulatory nonshivering thermogenesis (RNST) in 98 female and 17 male adult Eptesicus fuscus (big brown bat). We measured BMR, RNST, and plasma levels of thyroid hormone (T3), leptin, and cortisol in bats captured in maternity colonies in eastern Massachusetts from May to August (from arousal from the hibernation phase to the prehibernation phase). We hypothesized that all three hormones are seasonally primarily metabolic hormones and secondarily thermogenic hormones. In males, only BMR signiﬁcantly changed seasonally. In females, all ﬁve variables signiﬁcantly changed seasonally. The seasonal pattern of plasma leptin and cortisol levels correlated with the seasonal pattern of BMR, with an initial increase followed by a decrease, suggesting that leptin and cortisol are primarily metabolic hormones. The seasonal pattern of plasma T3 levels generally paralleled the basic seasonal pattern of RNST, with both increasing at the second half of the season, suggesting that T3 is primarily a thermogenic hormone. The observed decrease in plasma leptin levels may be necessary to allow for the observed seasonal decrease in BMR, with the similar cortisol pattern important for leptin regulation. While T3 is needed to maintain BMR, it may play a more critical role in the seasonal regulation of RNST than of BMR.",

We measured BMR and plasma levels of thyroid hormone (T3) and leptin in bats captured in maternity colonies in eastern Massachusetts (MA; northern population) and in Alabama and Georgia (ALGA; southern population) to assess macrogeographic (between- or among-population) and microgeographic (within-population) variation in those traits. After accounting for effects of body mass, stage of pregnancy, and within-population variation, bats from the northern population did not differ signiﬁcantly in BMR, T3, or leptin values from those in the southern population. However, after accounting for the effects of body mass and stage of pregnancy, a test for differences in all traits among colonies from both populations was signiﬁcant. For BMR, bats differed signiﬁcantly among the northern colonies. Moreover, after removing the effects of body mass and stage of pregnancy, bats from the AL colony had signiﬁcantly higher BMR than did bats from all other colonies except one in MA, and they had signiﬁcantly higher T3 levels but lower leptin levels than did bats from two other colonies. The presence of among-colony and withinpopulation variation for these traits suggests that proximate (nonevolutionary) factors (e.g., microhabitat differences such as roost type) play an important role in shaping intraspeciﬁc variation in BMR and its hormone correlates.",

Habitat diversity was quantified by Simpson's index based on the total areas of five vegetation types on each island. Island area varied over two orders of magnitude (13–1510 km\n              2\n              ) and habitat diversity varied between 1 and 3·7 equivalents of equally abundant habitat types.\n            \n            \n              2.\n               Because the Lesser Antilles consist of an inner arc of high, volcanic islands and an outer arc of low‐lying islands formed of uplifted marine sediments, correlations between area and elevation (\n              r\n              2\n               = 0·32) and between area and habitat diversity (\n              r\n              2\n               = 0·40) were weak. Habitat diversity was, however, strongly correlated with maximum island elevation (\n              r\n              2\n               = 0·85).\n            \n            \n              3.\n               Simple correlations of species richness with island area were significant for all four faunal groups, and simple correlations of species richness with elevation and habitat were significant for all groups except bats. In multiple regressions of species richness on area and habitat diversity together, area was a significant effect for birds and bats, and habitat diversity was a significant effect for birds, butterflies, and reptiles and amphibians.\n            \n            \n              4.\n               These results suggest that the four Lesser Antillean taxonomic groups differ in their responses to area and habitat diversity. For butterflies and for reptiles and amphibians, the relationship of species richness to area is probably a fortuitous consequence of a relationship between habitat diversity and area. Bird species richness responds independently to both habitat diversity and area, and bat species richness is influenced by area but not by habitat diversity.\n            \n            \n              5.\n               We suggest that this variation is related to differences in several biological traits of the different faunal groups. Strong habitat‐diversity effects are likely in taxa with high degrees of habitat specialization, populations large enough to have a low probability of stochastic extinction, life‐cycles that include a resistant resting stage that reduces vulnerability to catastrophic extinction, or a combination of these traits. In contrast, strong area effects are likely in taxa with weak habitat specialization, low population density, or both.\n            \n            \n              6.\n               At least in Lesser Antillean birds, it is unlikely that immigration depends on island size. Therefore, the species–area relationship for birds is probably generated by island‐size‐dependent extinction. Among the four taxonomic groups we studied, only butterflies are likely to show a ‘rescue effect’ stemming from frequent between‐island movement of individuals, as only butterflies exhibited low levels of endemism and lacked a unique area effect for species richness.\n            \n            \n              7.\n               Considered in concert, these taxon‐specific differences demonstrate that both biological characteristics of organisms and geographical features of island groups mediate the relative contribution of island area and habitat diversity to variation in species richness.",

Tagging success, in terms of retention and function, was 92 per cent (n=61) by the third year of using the method. Sixteen per cent (n=39) of bats tagged during the three‐year study period were not producing positive scans with the microchip reader when recaptured after previously successful tag insertion, indicating that the tags were either working their way out of the bats or ceasing to function.",

In this study we describe the kinematics of locomotion in both species, and the kinetics of locomotion in M. tuberculata. We sought to determine whether these bats move terrestrially the way other quadrupeds do, or whether they possess altogether different patterns of movement on the ground than are observed in quadrupeds that do not ﬂy. Using high-speed video analyses of bats moving on a treadmill, we observed that both species possess symmetrical lateral-sequence gaits similar to the kinematically deﬁned walks of a broad range of tetrapods. At high speeds, D. rotundus use an asymmetrical bounding gait that appears to converge on the bounding gaits of small terrestrial mammals, but with the roles of the forelimbs and hindlimbs reversed. This gait was not performed by M. tuberculata.",

As a result, artiﬁcial roosts are increasingly proposed as a short to medium-term mitigation measure, despite the absence of speciﬁc protocols for the installation, maintenance, and suitability for New Zealand bats. As of 2021, more than 110 artiﬁcial roosts had been installed in urban parks within Hamilton City, New Zealand. To determine their uptake and suitability for long-tailed bats, 74 Kent style roosts of varying ages were monitored for 1 year, with 24 (32%) roosts observed occupied by long-tailed bats. Occupation was generally infrequent, with no clear seasonal pattern or speciﬁc areas of occupation. However, two older roosts were consistently occupied, with numbers notably increasing during the summer maternity season. Distance to stand edge was the only factor that could be used to predict occupation, with logistic regression indicating that long-tailed bats may prefer roosts in less exposed areas with stable microclimates, within tree stands or sheltered landscape features. Future artiﬁcial roost installations should site roosts away from the stand edge in sheltered locations, ideally near natural or already occupied roosts to facilitate discovery and uptake.",

The size of the range may have increased further if more individuals had been tracked, as three of the four colonies studied had not reached their asymptotes. The total home‐range area covered by four serotine colonies was 127.36 km\n              2\n              . Excluding non‐breeding bats, a density of one bat per 120 ha was estimated. However, actual density was likely to be higher if there were additional non‐breeding females and immatures that were not in nursery roosts. Colonial home ranges and core areas overlapped, with individuals from different colonies feeding at the same sites. Individual home ranges (\n              n\n              = 32) varied from 0.16 to 47.58 km\n              2\n              , but these were not used exclusively by one individual. Around the colonial core area and breeding roosts, home ranges were used by all individuals from a single colony. It is only further from the core area that ranges appeared to be used by individuals. The distance from roost to feeding areas varied by up to 7.4 km, but the bat usually commuted along lines of trees and hedges and over pastures. This resulted in greater distances being travelled than if they had flown by a direct route. On average, individuals commuted distances of 8 km each night between feeding areas, with a maximum distance of over 41 km. They visited between 0 and 10 feeding sites each night (mean = 2.89).",

We used radiotelemetry to track 9 adult females, including 3 lactating and 6 postlactating bats, during July–September 2003. We found that these bats showed considerable fidelity to a common foraging area at the confluence of the John Day River and a tributary creek along which bats commuted and roosted. Individual bats did not roost together, but each showed high fidelity to local clusters of rock outcrops in small side canyons along the tributary. Roosts were not found in large, exposed cliff faces, despite the availability of such features. Rather, radio-tagged bats roosted in smaller outcrops that averaged 4.5 m in height. Bats commuted up to 12 km from roosts in the tributary canyon to the common foraging site at the river confluence and remained on the wing to forage for up to 4 h before returning to day roosts. No radio-tagged bats were observed using night roosts, even after pups were weaned. Our study provides a description of roosting, commuting, and foraging activity, as well as habitat use, of western small-footed myotis. This information provides a nuanced perspective on the ecology of canyon-dwelling bats in the region. Such perspective could be useful for conservation and habitat management.",

The skull measurements of 11 out of the 12 species were osteometrically examined using principal component analyses (PCA) based on 33 craniodental measurements from 150 specimens. Our analyses indicated that according to the overall skull size, the studied species could be divided as follows: large species (M. tiensa and M. fionae), medium-sized species (M. huttoni, M. cyclotis, M. annamitica, M. beelzebub, M. walstoni, and M. feae), and small species (M. eleryi, M. chrysochaetes, and M. harpioloides). The three size clusters did not overlap with each other in terms of total length of the skull (STOTL), mandible length (ML) and log-transformed raw data PC1 scores. Within a cluster, several species pairs overlapped in overall skull size despite of differences in the shapes. The PCA results suggested that Murina species of Vietnam were differentiated with a combination of the skull size and shape. Sexual dimorphism was confirmed in M. cyclotis and M. annamitica, with the females larger than the males. Particularly, M. cyclotis showed extensive sexual dimorphism with no overlaps in the measurements, whereas M. annamitica showed less measurable differences between the sexes. It was also evidenced that the extent of sexbiased size dimorphism differs among species in the genus Murina.",

We found that although R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx were the two primary seed dispersers of S. oblatum over half of the fruit produced by the tree (65%) fell to the ground. Out of the fruit collected, R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx were able to disperse seeds up to 73 m from the parent tree with the highest density of feeding roosts occurring at 21.3 m (SE = 5.2 m). We found no signs that either species of bat used the parent tree as a feeding roost, instead choosing speciﬁc trees that were at lower densities compared with other trees in the forest that were not used. When comparing the viability of seeds in three different habitats (under parent tree, in forest gap, under feeding roost) survival analysis revealed that seedling survival was signiﬁcantly higher in the forest gap (91.7% ± 4.41%) than under the parent tree (78.3% ± 1.67%), but was not signiﬁcantly different to seedling survival underneath feeding roosts (86.7 ± 1.67%). Further work also showed that the seeds did not have to be removed from the fruit or ingested by the bat in order to germinate. We conclude that although S. oblatum is not dependent on R. leschenaulti and C. sphinx for successful germination of its seeds, these two species of bat are important seed dispersers and can move seeds to areas where there is a greater chance of germination success and survival.",

Therefore, our aim was to investigate physiological and behavioural strategies employed by the fruit bat Nyctimene robinsoni (body mass ~50g) in winter in tropical Northern Queensland in relation to ambient temperature (Ta) and the lunar cycle. Daily body temperature (Tb) fluctuations in free-ranging bats were measured via radio-telemetry and metabolic rate was measured in captivity via open-flow respirometry (Ta, 15–30°C). Free-ranging bats showed a significant 24h circadian cycle in Tb, with the lowest Tb at the end of the rest phase just after sunset and the highest Tb at the end of the activity phase just before sunrise. Average daily core Tb ranged from 34.7±0.6 to 37.3±0.8°C (mean ± s.d.) over an average daily Ta range of 17.1±1.1 to 23.5±1.8°C. Tb never fell below 30°C but Tb was significantly reduced during the full moon period compared with that during the new moon period. Tb was correlated with Ta during the second half of the rest phase (P<0.001) but not during the active phase. Resting metabolic rate of bats was significantly affected by Ta (P<0.001, R20.856). Our results show that tube-nosed bats exhibit reduced Tb on moonlit nights when they reduce foraging activity, but during our study torpor was not expressed. The energy constraints experienced here by tube-nosed bats with relatively moderate Ta fluctuations, short commuting distances between roosting and feeding locations, and high availability of food were probably not substantial enough to require use of torpor.",

The lesser longnosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) is classiﬁed as threatened in Mexico; however, many aspects of its reproductive biology are still unstudied. The formation of a dorsal patch in males of Leptonycteris spp. during the mating period has been described and evidence suggests this patch is involved in reproductive behavior. We determined the male reproductive cycle of L. yerbabuenae over time based on the seminiferous cycle. We then related these internal indicators with 3 external indicators—testis size, dorsal patch size, and female/male ratio in the population. Finally, we evaluated whether the epididymis functions in long-term sperm storage. Bats were captured monthly and external indicators were registered. Three adult males were euthanized each month for the evaluation of internal indicators. We determined only 1 period of spermatogenesis per year beginning in September and completing in January. The seminiferous epithelium cycle showed 11 stages and 14 steps. Internal reproductive indicators were correlated with external indicators. External testis size and female/male ratio were positively correlated with dorsal patch size. A testis size of approximately 48.2 mm2 corresponded with the beginning of sperm production. The epididymis was not involved in long-term sperm storage. This study provides the 1st description in L. yerbabuenae of the annual timing of the male reproductive cycle based on histological characteristics, and also reports a relationship between the size of the dorsal patch and male reproductive function.",

We examined whether or not specialization breakdown has occurred in a presumably bat-pollinated columnar cactus, Pilosocereus royenii, on Puerto Rico, an island subjected to periodic hurricanes. The ﬂowers show characteristics related to bat pollination including nocturnal anthesis, morphology, and amount and quality of nectar reward. The cactus produces ﬂowers whose styles are temporally and mechanically separated from its anthers and do not self-pollinate. Hand manipulations indicated that it is partially self-incompatible or suffers some inbreeding depression. In 217 h of observations conducted biweekly over the course of 1 yr, P. royenii received visits from bats, moths, bees, and birds, but the only effective pollinator was the carpenter bee, Xylocopa mordax. Only four bat visits were recorded, all prior to stigma receptiveness. Floral morphology of P. royenii was signiﬁcantly more variable than that of other bat-pollinated species of the genus. We propose that infrequent bat visits are a consequence of a population crash and that ﬂoral variability is due to either relaxed selection for bat pollination or a transitional stage from bat pollination to bee pollination.",

Knowledge of what the bats eat will allow predictions of which habitats contribute most prey. Three male serotines were kept in captivity during the months of July and August 1991 and fed known quantities of identified insects. With captive\n              E. serotinus\n              the remains of prey appeared within 33 min of first bite and continued to appear for up to 32 h after consumption. Scales from two\n              Noctua pronuba\n              moths consumed were contained in 59 subsequent droppings. Similarly, fragments of three beetles,\n              Geotrupes stercorarius\n              , were contained in 28 subsequent faeces.\n            \n            \n              Analysis of the faeces of free‐living bats revealed insects from seven orders. Coleoptera were found to be present in 96.1% of the droppings examined; the next most frequently found order was Lepidoptera, occurring in 14.7%. The beetles were mostly associated with hay meadows (\n              Aphodius\n              spp. and\n              Melolontha\n              spp.), or grazed pasture (\n              Aphodius\n              spp. and\n              Geotrupes\n              spp.). Quantitative determination of prey eaten is not possible owing to the large number of the droppings shown to contain the remains of marker insects and the long period over which they are produced.",

The species is a large leaf-nosed bat, mid-way in size between the two other species known from the group, H. lylei and H. pratti, and its skull is significantly different in shape compared to the other two species. The new species roosts at least partially in caves in areas of degraded mixed deciduous and semi-evergreen forest as well as in areas of undisturbed semi-evergreen forest. The known distribution of all three species appears be allopatric, however, many areas within the region remain to be surveyed and so subsequent survey work may show the species to be sympatric.",

A total of 28 fungal isolates, 6 isolates from human clinical samples and 22 isolates from environmental (infected bat and contaminated soil) samples, were studied. Among the 14 isolates from Mexico, 71.4% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 48.3% to 94.5%) were of the\n              MAT1-2\n              genotype, whereas 100% of the isolates from Brazil were of the\n              MAT1-1\n              genotype. Each\n              MAT1\n              idiomorphic region was sequenced and aligned, using the sequences of the G-217B (+ mating type) and G-186AR (− mating type) strains as references. BLASTn analyses of the\n              MAT1-1\n              and\n              MAT1-2\n              sequences studied correlated with their respective + and − mating type genotypes. Trees were generated by the maximum likelihood (ML) method to search for similarity among isolates of each\n              MAT1\n              idiomorph. All\n              MAT1-1\n              isolates originated from Brazilian bats formed a well-defined group; three isolates from Mexico, the G-217B strain, and a subgroup encompassing all soil-derived isolates and two clinical isolates from Brazil formed a second group; last, one isolate (EH-696P) from a migratory bat captured in Mexico formed a third group of the\n              MAT1-1\n              genotype. The\n              MAT1-2\n              idiomorph formed two groups, one of which included two\n              H. capsulatum\n              isolates from infected bats that were closely related to the G-186AR strain. The other group was formed by two human isolates and six isolates from infected bats. Concatenated ML trees, with internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) -5.8S-ITS2 and\n              MAT1-1\n              or\n              MAT1-2\n              sequences, support the relatedness of\n              MAT1-1\n              or\n              MAT1-2\n              isolates.\n              H. capsulatum\n              mating types were associated with the geographical origin of the isolates, and all isolates from Brazil correlated with their environmental sources.",

However, the northern part of its distribution exhibits a gap of 1050 km.

Finally, we propose hypotheses about the factors that could determine the rarity category of this species.",

In Colombia, Histiotus humboldti and H. montanus colombiae have been recorded, but undescribed species has been suggested. We evaluated the species richness and distribution of Colombian Histiotus using morphological, molecular, and acoustic traits. Our results evidence three species in Colombia, the two previously recorded taxa and a new species from the Cordillera Central of Colombia and northern Ecuador that we describe here. We also revalidated H. colombiae as a full species. H. humboldti is widely distributed in the Colombian and Ecuadorean Andes and can be sympatric with the other two species. H. colombiae is restricted to the Colombian Cordillera Oriental. Finally, we highlight the potential hidden diversity within Histiotus in the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes, the need to resolve the evolutionary relationships of the genus, and its implications to the understanding of the processes that have structured the Andean mammal fauna.",

Using mist nets and ultrasonic recordings we release new information on activity patterns and roost use by M. atacamensis in Chile. We also report new records for the species, extending its distribution range to Santiago Metropolitan region. Our results suggest a wide distribution and relative abundance of M. atacamensis in northern Chile, in addition to remarkable habitat diversity for populations of this species. Bats were active in both natural and anthropogenic habitats. Abandoned mines and buildings in rural villages were the roosts most used by the species. These data provide additional information on the distribution, ecology, and natural history of M. atacamensis and can be useful in the design of conservation action plans for populations in the country.",

Based on acoustic surveys, we report here the ﬁrst record of this genus for the country. Fourteen echolocation sequences of the Western mastiﬀ bat (Eumops perotis) were recorded in the valleys of Azapa, Lluta, and Camarones in the Arica and Parinacota region, northern Chile. Echolocation calls of E. perotis can be distinguished from other bat species in the region by its lower frequency range, longer call duration, and interpulse intervals. This ﬁnding adds a new genus and species for Chile and increases the known bat diversity in the country to 17 species.",

To better assess the diversity of bats there, we conducted acoustic surveys at Arica city and three coastal valleys (Azapa, Lluta and Camarones) in the Arica and Parinacota region, Chile. We obtained 82 acoustic records of the Peale’s free-tailed bat (\n              Nyctinomops aurispinosus\n              ) in nine sites within the region. This species had not been previously documented in Chile but was known from adjacent Tacna province, Peru. Echolocation calls of\n              N. aurispinosus\n              can be distinguished from other molossid bat species occurring in the area by its lower frequency range. Our data suggest a wide distribution of\n              N. aurispinosus\n              across the coastal valleys of the Arica and Parinacota region, where they were active in both natural and anthropized habitats. This southernmost record of\n              N. aurispinosus\n              for the Pacific coast, extends its known range ca. 150 km southward, and increases up to 15 the number of bat species in Chile.",

Phenology, pollination biology and behaviour of ﬂower visitors of this species were compared in six conserved and disturbed sites, hypothesising that: (i) pitire pollination is self-incompatible, requiring animal vectors; (ii) higher incidence of radiation on plants in cleared forest may lead to a higher number of ﬂowers per pitire plant and longer blooming season, and disturbing and differential spatial availability of ﬂower resources may determine differential attraction of pollinators to conserved and disturbed areas; (iii) if pitire pollination system is specialised, reproductive success would decrease with pollinator scarcity, or other species may substitute for main pollinators. In all sites, pitire reproduction started in January, ﬂowering peak occurring in April, anthesis duration was 15 h and predominantly nocturnal (9 h), pollen was released at 23:00 h, nectar was produced throughout anthesis, and breeding system was self-incompatible. Flower production per plant was similar in disturbed and conserved sites, but ﬂower availability was higher (because of higher tree density) and longer in disturbed sites. Pollination is nocturnal, the most frequent legitimate pollinator being the bat Leptonycteris yerbabuenae; diurnal pollination is rare but possible, carried out by bee species. Fruit and seed set in control and nocturnal pollination treatments at disturbed sites were higher than in conserved sites. Frequency of L. yerbabuenae visits was similar among site types, but more visits of complementary nocturnal and diurnal pollinators were recorded in disturbed sites, which could explain differences in reproductive success.",

Our study provides pre-WNS (2009) capture rates and roosting-behavior data for Northern Long-eared Bats in the southern Appalachians. We conducted mist-net surveys at 37 sites and radio-tracked female Northern Long-eared Bats to their day roosts in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. We compared tree and plot characteristics for roosts and corresponding random trees using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Our 43 survey nights yielded 302 bats of 11 species; Northern Long-eared Bats were the most commonly captured species (n = 97). We located 14 unique roosts for 7 radio-tracked bats; Pinus strobus (White Pine) snags (n = 8) were the most common roost sites. We observed a colony of 72 bats using a White Pine snag as a maternity roost. Roost trees were significantly larger in diameter and had more solar exposure above the roost and within the plot than random trees. Our data show the high abundance of Northern Long-eared Bats pre-WNS, highlight the use of White Pine roosts in an area impacted by a Dendroctonus frontalis (Southern Pine Beetle) outbreak, and support previous determinations of roost-selection flexibility by Northern Long-eared Bats across their range.",

The inference based on molecular phylogenetics methods shows that these two morphotypes correspond to two mitochondrial groups within the Iberian Peninsula. Our results also support the model of ‘refugia within refugia’, where M. d. daubentonii has spread north and M. d. nathalinae has became an Iberian endemism. The haplotype network indicates haplotype sharing between Monfurado and S. Mamede (Portugal) and Bavaria (Germany), demonstrating current or recent dispersal and gene flow between these populations. Myotis d. nathalinae displays a substructure showing that populations under the same climate type are more related. As a distinct Iberian endemism, the conservation status of M. d. nathalinae should be reviewed.",

To better assess the diversity of bats in the region, we conducted full-spectrum acoustic surveys at several sites in Yukon, Canada. During our surveys we obtained the 1st acoustic records of Hoary Bat (Lasiurus cinereus) and Long-Legged Myotis (Myotis volans) in Yukon. Neither species had been documented previously in the territory, but one or both species were known from adjacent Alaska, British Columbia, and Northwest Territories. Characteristics of certain echolocation calls of Hoary Bats and Long-legged Myotis are difficult to confuse with other species that might also occur in the region. In addition, we made other noteworthy recordings; however, species identification for these other echolocation calls was ambiguous. These 1st records significantly increase our knowledge of the ranges of these bat species in Yukon, Canada. Further acoustic surveys, coupled with live captures, will help us further understand the diversity and distribution of bats in Yukon.",

We explored the importance of pollinator shifts in explaining ﬂoral divergence among 15 species of Iochroma. We examined four continuously varying ﬂoral traits: corolla length, nectar reward, display size, and ﬂower color. Pollinator associations were characterized with a continuously varying measure of pollinator importance (the product of visitation and pollen deposition) for four groups of pollinators: hummingbirds, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera. A phylogenetic generalized least squares approach was used to estimate correlations between pollinator groups and ﬂoral traits across a sample of Bayesian trees using different models of trait evolution. Multivariate analyses were also employed to identify suites of traits associated with each pollinator group. We found that nonphylogenetic models typically ﬁt the data better than phylogenetic models (Brownian motion, Ornstein–Uhlenbeck), and thus results varied little across trees. Our results indicated that species with high nectar reward and large displays are signiﬁcantly more likely to be pollinated by hummingbirds and less likely to be pollinated by all groups of insects. Corolla length and ﬂower color did not show any consistently signiﬁcant associations with pollinator groups. For these two traits, we discuss alternative evolutionary forces, including phylogenetic inertia and community-level factors.",

This study used auditory brainstem responses to measure temporal masking effects in the free-tailed bat, Tadarida brasiliensis. A digital subtraction protocol was used to isolate responses to the second of a pair of pulses varying in interval, revealing a suppression phase lasting <4 ms followed by an enhancement phase lasting 4–15 ms during which the ABR waveform was ampliﬁed up to 100%. The results suggest echolocating bats possess adaptations for enhancing sonar receiver gain shortly after pulse emission.",

However, to date, very little is known about the effect of seed ingestion by bats on seed germination. We carried out some germination assays for seeds of the cactus I. dumortieri obtained directly from fruits and fecal clumps of the endangered lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae) in a semiarid zone, within the Biosphere Reserve Barranca of Metztitla´n in Central Me´xico. Additionally, we evaluated seed deposition patterns by bats. We found that 61.7% of the removed seeds were dispersed in fecal clumps, whereas the remaining seeds were spitted as single seeds. We also found that ingestion diminished seed germination by 65%. Under these conditions, seeds deposited individually around the mother plant may be of importance for local restoration and have the function of reforesting the locality, whereas ingested seeds can reach long distances and colonize new areas.",

In this work, we studied the pollination biology and the breeding system of\n              Harrisia portoricensis\n              , an island columnar cactus, to test for the presence of inbreeding and inbreeding depression. For\n              H. portoricensis\n              , which bears flowers with typical outcrossing morphology, the results from 322 h of direct observations and videotaping showed that visits to flowers by animals were uncommon. Controlled pollinations demonstrated that\n              H. portoricensis\n              has a partially self‐compatible breeding system that it is not autogamous and thus requires an external mechanism for the movement of pollen to set fruit. We detected differences in seed size, seed mass, germination success, and multiplicative fitness estimates between self‐ and cross‐pollination treatments. We found that progeny resulting from natural and self‐pollination treatments showed signs of inbreeding depression compared with progeny resulting from cross‐pollination; however, the magnitude of the inbreeding depression was less than 50%. Our combined results suggest that for this species an endogamous breeding system should be favored by natural selection.",

Adults arrive in the colony in mid-September and ¡eave in February, no bats were present at tbis site from the beginning of March to mid-September. Births occur between mid-November and mid-December. Pups roosted in compact c1usters in the nursery areas, spatially segregated from adults. Densities of these aggregations were 643 ± 76 bats/m2 (p < 0.20). and adult densitíes were 161 ± 21 bats/m2 (p < 0.20). 182 bats were captured. They were sexed and weighed. Mean adult females mass was, 13.26g before parturition and 12.01g after parturition. Recorded data inc1uded daily activity pattems.. Barn Owls (Tyto alba) and domes­ tic cats prey on bats leaving the colony. Rabies virus was no! detected. T he insect biological control exerted by this colony was estimated and it would be of 209 to 385 kg of insects nightly between September and late February, demonstrating the important role they play in the urban ecosistem.",

To examine the consequences of fragmentation and limited dispersal on patterns of genetic structure and variation, we used microsatellite markers to screen bats from around 50% of the known maternity colonies in Britain, and two areas from continental Europe. Analyses revealed that Welsh and English colonies were genetically isolated. This, and lower variability in Britain than north France, may result from either genetic drift, or the species’ colonization history. Gene ﬂow among most neighbouring colonies was not generally restricted, with one exception. These ﬁndings have important implications for the ongoing conservation management of this species.",

Their taxonomy has been in a state of flux. Here, we use mitochondrial and nuclear sequences to evaluate species relationships, confirming the monophyly of both Triaenops and Paratriaenops. Although most Triaenops afer specimens are recovered as a group, mitochondrial analyses strongly support some Kenyan individuals as members of Triaenops persicus. Analyses of four nuclear introns (ACOX2, COPS7A, RODGI and STAT5A) strongly support the mitochondrial topology. Morphometric analysis of the skull, external morphology and echolocation calls confirm that the Triaenops from the Rift Valley in Kenya (Nakuru, Baringo and Pokot counties) are distinct from typical T. afer in coastal (Kilifi and Kwale counties) or interior (Laikipia and Makueni counties) colonies. We interpret these analyses to indicate that two species of Triaenops occur in East Africa: T. afer in coastal regions along the Indian Ocean and in the highlands of central Kenya and Ethiopia, and T. persicus in the Rift Valley of Kenya. Although they appear widely disjunct from Middle Eastern populations, Kenyan T. persicus might be more widely distributed in the Rift Valley; they are somewhat differentiated from Middle Eastern populations in terms of both cranial morphology and vocalizations.",

            "abstractNote": "The increasing loss of biodiversity and the need to delay the sixth mass extinction on earth resulted in several international conventions aiming at protecting threatened species. Protection improves with increasing knowledge of the biology and ecology of these species. However, species numbers rapidly increase with the ongoing description of cryptic species, resulting in a lack of ecological knowledge for each of these species. We studied the nutritional ecology of three cryptic bat species of the Myotis mystacinus group using stable isotope analysis and molecular fecal analysis. Inter- and intraspecific variations were compared by calculating the isotopic and dietary niches for each species. We hypothesized (a) that all three species are generalists, but (b) that M. mystacinus and Myotis brandtii are more similar to each other than to Myotis alcathoe. Third we assumed that the occupied niches are intraspecifically more similar than interspecifically. We could show that the members of the M. mystacinus group differ in their nutritional ecology. Our data suggest that M. alcathoe is the most specialized species of the group, occupying a more distinct ecological niche compared to the other two species. Interestingly, the dietary and isotopic niche overlap was higher interspecifically than intraspecifically. Furthermore, considering our findings and those from other studies we illustrate implications for the conservation of these cryptic species.",

However, this more likely reflects rarity than low discovery effort, because in one large population (>1000 individuals) in Sonora, putatively negative records occurred at only 31% of 16 sampling dates. Currently, live individuals of\n                    P. cavernis\n                    are known from only one cave in the United States and one in Mexico.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Protecting these existing sites is necessary to preserve this charismatic animal but it should not release us from aiming to discover new sites.",

            "abstractNote": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of androgenmediated, prolonged sperm-storage in the female reproductive tract of the bat, Scotophilus heathii. The bat treated in vivo with ﬂutamide, an androgen antagonist, showed loss of spermatozoa at the storage site, utero-tubal junction. Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis revealed the presence of increased expression of Bcl2 in the epithelial cell lining of the utero-tubal junction during the period of spermstorage. Treatment with testosterone in vitro caused a signiﬁcant dose-dependent increase in expression of the survival factor Bcl2, whereas treatment with ﬂutamide together with testosterone caused a signiﬁcant decline in Bcl2 in the utero-tubal junction of S. heathii. Together with the expression of Bcl2, the utero-tubal junction also expresses the death signal, caspase3. Expression of caspase3 decreased during January, but increased in February during the late stage of sperm storage. Androgen stimulated Bcl2 synthesis in the utero-tubal junction via the non-genomic MAP kinase signaling pathway. In conclusion, this study suggests that androgen promotes sperm storage in S. heathii by stimulating the survival factor Bcl2 in the utero-tubal junction. It is further hypothesized that a balance between the survival factor, Bcl2, and the death signal, caspase3, determines the duration of sperm storage in S. heathii.",

In order to understand how sperm storage in the female genital tract of the vespertilionid bat,\n                Scotophilus heathi\n                (Greater yellow bat), is controlled, we compared concentrations of glucose and the fatty‐acid carrier carnitine in the blood, and carnitine concentrations and levels of expression of the glucose transporters (GLUTs) and the carnitine transporter OCTN2 in the utero‐tubal junction of females during non‐storage (early winter) and sperm‐storage periods (late winter‐early spring). During the sperm‐storage period (December–January) blood glucose concentrations declined, as did the expression of GLUT3 and GLUT5 in the utero‐tubal junction. At the same time there were increases in the concentration of carnitine, and expression of OCTN2 and hormone‐sensitive lipase (HSL) in the utero‐tubal junction. These results suggest that prolonged sperm storage is enhanced by decreased glucose availability but increased free fatty acid availability at the site of sperm storage. Increases in expression of GLUT4 and GLUT8 in late winter suggest a role for these GLUTs in increasing sperm motility prior to fertilization. J. Exp.

            "abstractNote": "Nyctalus noctula is one of the most common bats in the western Palearctic, whereas N. leisleri is relatively rare (except in Ireland, where N. noctula does not occur) and more limited to ancient forests. We radiotracked 26 N. noctula and 25 N. leisleri to 52 and 50 roost trees, respectively, from May to August in 1998–2002 in the Białowiez˙a Primeval Forest in eastern Poland to test the hypothesis that N. leiseri has more speciﬁc tree-roosting requirements than N. noctula. Both species selected roosts at the microscale (cavity level), mesoscale (tree level), and megascale (plot level). N. noctula signiﬁcantly preferred oaks, and avoided hornbeams and alders. N. leisleri roosted more often in oaks and ashes, and avoided hornbeams and alders. Roost trees occupied by both species were thicker and taller, with higher crowns than available trees. N. noctula and N. leisleri used oaks more frequently than ashes when average ambient temperatures were lower. Pregnant and lactating females of both species most often used oaks, whereas after the young could ﬂy most roosts were in other tree species, mainly ashes. Reproductive status inﬂuenced the choice of roosts used by N. noctula, whereas both the reproductive status and ambient temperature were inﬂuential for N. leisleri. Both taxa preferred dying trees and avoided healthy ones, although N. noctula used hollows in healthy trees signiﬁcantly more often than N. leisleri. In our opinion, more frequent use of healthy trees by N. noctula suggests a better ability to exploit younger, managed forests. However, differences in roost selection between these species were small.",

The naming of these new taxa has important bearings in conservation, as this is the first step needed for them to be recognised by the scientific community but also legally. The naming of new animal species, however, needs to follow the strict rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature in order to be available and to provide a stable basis for further taxonomic research. We report here a case where new names have been improperly proposed to designate distinctive lineages in the Natterer's bat species complex. As these new names do not follow several mandatory rules imposed by the Code, they are declared unavailable and are not to be used for further taxonomy studies.",

Por medio de capturas mensuales entre agosto de 1993 y julio de 1994 se determinó la dieta y el pacrón reproductivo del murciélago. Los resultados indicaron que\n                G. longirostris\n                consumió polen (53%) de cactáceas y de\n                Helicteris baruensis\n                (Sterculiaceae) y frutos (41%) de la cactácea columnar\n                Stenocereus\n                griseus y en menor cantidad los de\n                Muntingia calabura\n                (Elaeocarpaceae) y\n                Pilosocereus\n                sp. (Cactaceae). El polen apareció en las heces y pelaje de\n                G. longirostris\n                durante todo el año, siendo más fiecuente en los meses secos. Las semillas aparecieron en las muestras fecales en las dos épocas lluviosas. Estas variaciones estacionales en la dieta eSNvierOn correlacionadas con la disponibilidad de recursos en el área y no parecen reflejar una preferencia de alimento por pane de\n                G. longirostris\n                . Este glosofigno presentó dos picos reproductivos. Los picos de lactancia coincidieron con las dos épocas de lluvias y con la mayor oferta de frutos de\n                S. griseus\n                . Estas observaciones no fueron consistentes con las relaciones encontradas entre la disponibilidad de recursos de tra especies de cactáceas (\n                S. Griseus, Subpilocereus repandus y Pilosocereus tillianus\n                ) y el patrón reproductivo de este murciélago en la zona árida interandina de Lagunillas, Mérida, Venezuela. Las diferencias encontradas en la dieta y los períodos reproductivos de las dos poblaciones de\n                G. longirostris\n                , pueden ser un reflejo de diferencias en la distribución temporal y spacial de las fuentes de alimento. El grado de interacción entre\n                G. longirostris\n                y las cactáceas columnares, especialmente con\n                S. grieus\n                , parece ser muy estrecho.\n              \n            \n            \n              ABSTRACT\n              \n                Mutualistic relations between the bat\n                Glossophaga longirostris\n                and columnar cacti were studied in the Andean arid region of La Tatacoa, Huila, Colombia By means of monthly censuses between August 1993 and July 1994, the diet and reproductive pattern of this bat species was determined. This bat consumed pollen (53%) of cacti and of\n                Helicteris baruensis\n                (Sterculiaceae) and fruits (41%) of the columnar cactus\n                Stenocereus griseus\n                and, in lower quantities, of\n                Muntingia calabura\n                (Elaeocarpaceae) and\n                Pilosocereus\n                sp. (Cactaceae). Pollen appeared in feces and/or pelage of\n                G. longirostris\n                throughout the year, beiig more frequent during the dry season. Seeds appeared in the feces during the rainy season. The seasonal variations in diet were correlated with the availability of resources in the area and do not appear to reflect a dietary preference on the part of\n                G. longirostris\n                . This bat had two reproductive periods. The presence of lactating females coincided with the two rainy seasons and the months of highest fruit production of\n                S. griseus\n                . These results are not consistent with those reported for the Andean arid region of Lagunillas, Merida, Venezuela. In that region,\n                G. longirostris\n                depends for its diet and reproduction on three columnar cactus species (\n                S. griseus, Subpilocereus repandus\n                and\n                Pilosocereus tillianus\n                ). The differences found in the diet and periods of reproductive of these two populations of\n                G. longirostris\n                , may reflect differences in the temporal and spatial distribution of food resources. The mutualistic relation between\n                G. longirostris\n                and columnar cacti, specially with\n                S. griseus\n                appear to be tightly interdependent.",

            "abstractNote": "The Artibeus jamaicensis complex is an important component of the mammal biological diversity of the New World. Although there are numerous studies on the taxonomy and phylogeny of the complex, group relationships are still debated. Previous studies hypothesised that this species originated in South America and later colonised the Antilles Islands either through a northward migration or an eastward migration via Middle America. However, these studies do not include populations from Middle America west of the Yucatan Peninsula, making it difficult to obtain a clear description of the role of these populations in the evolutionary history of the species. In this study, we describe the phylogeography and demographic history of A. jamaicensis populations from Middle America west of the Yucatan Peninsula using cytochrome-b (612 bp) and D-loop (391 bp) mtDNA markers. Our phylogenetic analyses (maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference) did not recover clades corresponding to the previously recognised Middle American subspecies (A. j. triomylus and A. j. yucatanicus); rather, two haplogroups were observed, which showed extensive genetic diversity and strong genetic structure akin to that expected for a Middle American origin for the island populations. Bayesian skyline plots and mismatch distributions revealed that such haplogroups experienced a recent population expansion, which most likely took place in the late Pleistocene (100,000–216,000 BP). These estimates agree with earlier hypotheses that suggested a recent evolutionary history for A. jamaicensis, with hypotheses that suggested the existence of two different lineages migrating northwest from South America to Middle America, and with the possible colonisation of the Antilles Islands derived from both Yucatan Peninsula and northern South America.",

Bats feed on leaves by chewing a portion of leaf, extracting the liquid, and discarding the fibrous material. In the course of a study on the reproductive pattern of Artibeus amplus in the Venezuelan Andes, leaves were frequently observed in a cave used by this species as a roost. We took this opportunity to (1) identify the leaves consumed by this poorly known Neotropical bat species, and (2) test whether folivory is a temporal phenomenon, such as in other leaf-eating bat species. Artibeus amplus consumes the leaves of seven species of plants, and four of these were found in every month of the year during the study. We report for the first time: (1) folivory in A. amplus, (2) five plant species never reported before in the diet of a bat, and (3) folivory as a non-seasonal phenomenon.",
