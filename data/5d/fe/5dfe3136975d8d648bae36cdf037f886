The effects of this stochastic process can easily be confounded with those of gene flow, potentially leading to inaccurate estimates of dispersal capabilities or erroneous designation of evolutionarily significant units (ESUs). We have used phylogenetic, population genetic, and coalescent methods to examine genetic structuring in large populations of a widely dispersing bat species and to test hypotheses concerning the influences of coalescent stochasticity vs. gene flow. The Mexican free-tailed bat, Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana, exhibits variation in both migratory tendency and route over its range. Observations of the species’ migratory behaviour have led to the description of behaviourally and geographically defined migratory groups, with the prediction that these groups compose structured gene pools. Here, we used mtDNA sequence analyses coupled with existing information from allozyme, banding, and natural history studies to evaluate hypotheses regarding the relationship between migration and genetic structure. Analyses of molecular variance revealed no significant genetic structuring of behaviourally distinct migratory groups. Demographic analyses were consistent with population growth, although the timing of population expansion events differs between migratory and nonmigratory populations. Hypotheses concerning the role of gene flow vs. incomplete lineage sorting on these data are explored using coalescent simulations. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for coalescent stochasticity in formulating phylogeographical hypotheses, and indicates that analyses that do not take such processes into account can lead to false conclusions regarding a species’ phylogeographical history.",

Phylogenetic methods in combination with divergence time estimation can reveal biogeographical centres of origin, differentiate between hypotheses of vicariance and dispersal, and reveal the directionality of dispersal events. Despite their power, however, phylogenetic methods can sometimes yield patterns that are compatible with multiple, equally well-supported biogeographical hypotheses. In such cases, additional approaches must be integrated to differentiate among conflicting dispersal hypotheses. Here, we use a synthetic approach that draws upon the analytical strengths of coalescent and population genetic methods to augment phylogenetic analyses in order to assess the biogeographical history of Madagascar’s Triaenops bats (Chiroptera: Hipposideridae). Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequence data for Malagasy and east African Triaenops reveal a pattern that equally supports two competing hypotheses. While the phylogeny cannot determine whether Africa or Madagascar was the centre of origin for the species investigated, it serves as the essential backbone for the application of coalescent and population genetic methods. From the application of these methods, we conclude that a hypothesis of two independent but unidirectional dispersal events from Africa to Madagascar is best supported by the data.",

Taxa include T. persicus from east Africa and three Triaenops species from Madagascar (T. auritus, T. furculus, and T. rufus). The evolution of this bat family considerably post-dated the tectonic division of Madagascar from Africa, excluding vicariance as a viable hypothesis. Therefore, we consider three biogeographical scenarios to explain these species’ current ranges: (A) a single dispersal from Africa to Madagascar with subsequent speciation of the Malagasy species; (B) multiple, unidirectional dispersals from Africa to Madagascar resulting in multiple, independent Malagasy lineages; or (C) early dispersal of a proto-species from Africa to Madagascar, with later back-dispersal of a descendant Malagasy taxon to Africa.",

            "abstractNote": "The chiropteran family Myzopodidae is endemic to Madagascar and is characterized by several unique morphologies, such as sessile adhesive discs on the thumb and sole. A new species, Myzopoda schliemanni, was recently described from western Madagascar that is morphologically distinct and geographically disjunct from the eastern species, M. aurita, the only other member of this family. Geographic variation within Myzopoda has only recently been studied at the morphological level and has never been addressed at the genetic level. We used a combination of phylogenetic, coalescent, and population genetic analyses to characterize the speciation history of Myzopoda and to clarify current and former patterns of gene ﬂow within and between Myzopoda. Mitochondrial DNA sequences were used to determine whether genetic data support the morphologically distinct species M. schliemanni, to infer the distribution of the common ancestor of extant Myzopoda, to estimate effective population sizes (Ne) and levels of migration between species, and to determine patterns of population structure within species. Phylogenetic and network analyses revealed the existence of 4 well-supported clades in Myzopoda, but could not resolve relationships among those clades. Divergent haplotypes within species may result from either recent gene ﬂow between the 2 species or more likely from incomplete lineage sorting. Multiple coalescent-based methodologies produced concordant estimates of Ne for Myzopoda, but conﬂicting signals for migration between the species, probably reﬂecting differences in the underlying models used by the methods. We found signiﬁcant genetic structure within M. aurita, but no correlation with geography. This pattern may result from recent gene ﬂow facilitated by expansion of Ravenala stands, an important day-roost tree for Myzopoda, associated with anthropogenic deforestation and the opening up of new habitat for members of this genus.",

Variables of population composition such as abundance, sex proportion, and reproductive condition, together with biological tags (i.e., bat ﬂy prevalence), can provide information about spatiotemporal dynamics of habitats used by bats. In the central part of Veracruz, Mexico, we compared population variables and ectoparasite prevalence of the highland yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira ludovici) in two landscapes, one dominated by shade-coffee plantations and another by forest fragments. Comparing these attributes between these two landscapes will increase our knowledge about the role of this agro-ecosystem in the conservation of this species, which is an important seed disperser of cloud forest vegetation. Total abundance and proportion of females was greater in forest fragments than in coffee plantations, whereas the percentage of reproductive females and bat ﬂy prevalence was similar between landscapes. Our results show that landscapes with forest fragments harbor the greatest abundance of S. ludovici, but shade-coffee plantations also are utilized by S. ludovici and likely adjacent forest remnants provide enough food resources for this species and other frugivores. Moreover, this study provides more evidence documenting the importance of preserving the last cloud forest fragments in the central region of Veracruz, Mexico, and suggests that using shade-coffee plantations to connect forest fragments may be an effective way of maintaining populations of S. ludovici and likely other volant frugivores.",

Histoplasmosis is one of the most prevalent systemic mycoses in the Americas and occurs in several mammalian species. Bats are important in the epidemiological cycle of histoplasmosis because they disseminate the fungus throughout the environment. The aim of the present study was to investigate natural H. capsulatum infection in bats located in forested areas, which have undergone anthropogenic perturbations, as well as in the urban areas of the state of Pará. Twenty-two species of bats were captured in 18 municipalities of Pará; the samples obtained from these animals were subjected to nested PCR for amplification of H. capsulatum DNA. The HCI/HCII and HCIII/HCIV primers were used, and the final 210-pb fragment was amplified. Of the 100 bats analysed, two were confirmed to be positive for H. capsulatum. Samples amplified by nested PCR were sequenced and found to share identity and have 100% match with H. capsulatum DNA. H. capsulatum was detected in the area of study: the state of Pará has a wide diversity of bat species, and the region under investigation is situated in the north of the state, which suffers the most severe environmental and climatic changes. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the distribution of H. capsulatum hosts in this region to facilitate the implementation of effective disease surveillance.",

The ﬁrst analysis of habitat selection by R. mehelyi is provided, and the hypothesis explored that despite their close relatedness, in sympatry the two bat species showed different habitat preferences. For both species, the least preferred habitats were open habitats such as scrubland, grassland and arable land. As found elsewhere, R. euryale preferred broadleaved woodland. In addition, R. mehelyi also foraged in habitats characterized by loose trees, such as the ‘dehesa’, a semi-natural oak savanna. The progressive disappearance of the dehesa, jeopardized by land-use change, may not harm R. euryale, but could represent a threat to R. mehelyi, which would then be restricted to dense woodland, possibly competing with other bat species, including R. euryale. To conserve both species, the maintenance of a variety of wooded habitats of differing density is recommended.",

Switching behaviour was common to both sexes and did not depend on group size. We observed both individual and group switching, the latter often involving the abandonment of a roost tree on a single night. We suggest that behaviours such as flight activity around roosts or cavity inspection by bats play a role in recruiting group mates and coordinating their occupation of another site. Bats almost never crossed mountain ridges to use roosts located beyond them, possibly because ridges are regarded as boundaries delimiting main roosting areas. The rate of switching was lowest during the middle of the lactation period, probably to minimise problems related to the transportation of non‐volant young by their mothers. Although the maintenance of social relationship among bats spread over large forest areas may partly explain the occurrence of roost switching, the persistence of this behaviour in solitary bats and the movement of entire groups best fit the hypothesis that roost switching represents a way to maintain or increase knowledge of alternative roosts.",

They searched for insects in more or less open habitats, 2–50 m above ground, and usually established individual feeding territories, which were patrolled in straight or slightly curved flight paths at rather constant altitudes. Duration, bandwidth, amplitude, repetition rate and, to a lesser extent, terminal frequency of the echolocation pulses varied according to feeding habitat and situation. In general, long (13.0–17.7 ms), loud, shallow frequency‐modulated (FM) signals were used during search flight near treetop level (15 m) or above. At lower altitudes, steep FM‐components were added, and the terminal shallow‐sweep portions were shortened. These pulses were 6.3–13.4 ms long. Steep FM‐signals of short (0.4–8.4 ms) duration and relatively low amplitude were used in the vicinity of obstacles or targets.",

Herein, we provide the first account on prevalence and phenology of P. destructans in Poland. Bats were counted once per month, from October or January to May (2010-2013), in an abandoned ore mine in southern Poland. Presence of P. destructans in two samples was confirmed by sequencing of isolated fungal DNA. Observations of phenotypically identical mycosis on bats hibernating at this site in March 2006 are likely to be the first known records of P. destructans from Poland. All Pd-suspected individuals were Myotis myotis with an exception of one Myotis daubentonii. The first Pd-suspected bats were noted in mid-February, but their number was the highest in March, what overlapped with maximum numbers of hibernating M. myotis. The prevalence in March was 7%-27% of M. myotis individuals. No mass mortality of bats was observed in the mine, with only three dead individuals found in the hibernaculum which hosted up to 130 bats, representing 6-7 species.",

In the Neotropics, Peter’s tent-roosting bat (Uroderma bilobatum), known to roost in forests, has become abundant in human-modiﬁed areas. To understand how habitat characteristics in both intact forest and human-modiﬁed areas inﬂuence the presence and density of U. bilobatum, we characterized habitat use at two scales (macrohabitat and microhabitat) and used logistic and poisson regressions to determine which habitat characteristics best predicted the presence and density of U. bilobatum within each scale. Moreover, we performed a redundancy analysis to determine which habitat scale explained more variation. As these bats are obligate tent roosters, we used tent as a surrogate for bat presence and density. We found that both macrohabitat and microhabitat scales explained variation in presence and density. Characteristics of the microhabitat scale, however, had higher predictive power, revealing that U. bilobatum preferentially inhabits areas with high density of coconut palms. Coconut palms were introduced recently in the Neotropics and are found only in human-modiﬁed areas. Therefore, we hypothesize that U. bilobatum is expanding its range into these areas following the expanded distribution of this exotic plant species.",

This ﬁnding represents the ﬁrst record from the type locality one and a half century after Blyth (1848) ﬁrst described the species. C. frithii is considered near threaten in the IUCN Red List. The conﬁrmed occurrence through this record calls for future systematic surveys of this species within the Sundarbans.",

W. weberbaueri\n              exhibits pronounced interplant variation in floral color and size, and flowers exhibit traits corresponding to both bat and hummingbird pollination syndromes. Starch‐gel electrophoresis of flower bud tissue indicated that\n              W. weberbaueri\n              is an autotetraploid and that genetic diversity\n              (H\n              ep = 0.257) of the study population was high relative to diploid plants but similar to other tetraploid species. Initial fruit set from pollinator exclusion experiments conducted in 1991 and 1993, at the onset of and after a drought associated with the El Niño event of 1991–1992, revealed that bats were the most important pollinators in 1991, but that hummingbirds and diurnal insects were most important in 1993. In both years, however, autogamy and lepidopteran larval infestation of fruits reduced differences in mature fruit production among pollinator exclusion treatments so that differences in mature fruit set were not statistically significant. Reduced bat pollination in 1993 is attributed to the reduced abundance of bats at the study site during a drought caused by El Niño. I hypothesize that interaction among several factors, including tetraploidy, autogamy, larval infestation of developing fruits, and variation in pollinator abundance, may not result in strong selection for a bat vs. hummingbird floral morph, thus allowing the persistence of floral variation in this cactus.",

Eptesicus innoxius occurs in lowlands west of the Andes, with a geographic distribution restricted to northwestern and southern Ecuador, and northwestern Peru, at elevations from sea level to 1,200 m. It is listed as “Near Threatened” (NT) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature because of a suspected population reduction due to a significant decline of habitat where the species occurs.",

Traditionally, characteristics of the dispersal target sites that could increase survivorship of the dispersed plants are thought to be intrinsic to the sites. If directed dispersal is constant over extended periods of time, however, it is likely that nonrandom patterns of dispersal could modify the ecological characteristics of the target site in ways that could increase survivorship and ﬁtness of the dispersed plants. Here we report patterns of Piper diversity (richness, equitability, and similarity) and Piper folivory within plots near natural or artiﬁcial roosts of Carollia perspicillata vs. similar plots without bat roosts. Plots with bat roosts, both natural and artiﬁcial, had signiﬁcantly higher Piper species diversity. Additionally, we found that plots with a higher Piper species diversity showed less specialist folivory, higher generalist folivory, and lower total herbivore leaf damage than plots with low Piper diversity. Finally, plots with bat roosts also showed less specialist folivory, lower generalist folivory, and lower total folivory when compared to plots without roosts. We propose that long-lasting nonrandom patterns of seed dispersal can change the local ecological characteristics of target sites via changes in plant diversity, and that these changes are likely to reduce the local rates of folivory and, therefore, increase seed and adult plant survivorship Key words: artiﬁcial roost; bats; Carollia perspicillata; directed dispersal; folivory; herbivore; La Selva, Costa Rica; Piper spp.; plant diversity.",

Diet diversity in Neotropical frugivorous bats is based on core plant taxa that present different nutritional compositions and qualities. Sturnira bats eat fruits with high sugar concentration, while Artibeus species eat fruits with lower sugar content. In this study we investigated the intake sugar response of Sturnira ludovici and compare it with the intake response reported for Artibeus jamaicensis. Our results show that S. ludovici was unable to achieve compensatory feeding, ingesting twice the energy when feeding on the most concentrated solution with respect to the more diluted one. This finding suggests the existence of a physiological constraint limiting energy intake when this species feeds on low quality food. Intake response slope value for S. ludovici was lower than the one reported for A. jamaicensis, indicating that S. ludovici is less suited than A. jamaicensis to feed on food with low nutrient content. The role that a physiological limitation could have on the food intake of S. ludovici, and the ecological implications of our findings are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "Hibernation is a strategy used by some mammals to survive harsh winter conditions. Many small mammals, such as the little brown bat, Myotis lucifugus, enter a long-term state of hibernation characterized by a period of deep torpor that can range from days to weeks. Torpid bats undergo metabolic rate depression that not only results in physiological changes but also promotes biochemical changes that favor survival. The present study utilizes multiplex technology to assess key early apoptosis markers and a select group of antioxidant enzymes in muscle, heart, and liver in euthermic controls and torpid bats. Muscle showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p53 and the antioxidant enzyme catalase but a signiﬁcant increase in peroxiredoxin 2 levels. The heart responded similarly, with most proapoptotic proteins (caspase 8/9 and p53) remaining at low levels, while the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein signiﬁcantly increased during torpor. There was no signiﬁcant change in the antioxidant enzymes measured during torpor in the heart compared with the controls. The liver showed increases in catalase and Mn superoxide dismutase 2 enzymes during torpor, which correlated with activation of select antiapoptotic proteins and suppression of levels of proapoptotic ones. Overall, our data demonstrate that antiapoptotic and antioxidant defense responses have organ-speciﬁc regulation during torpor in bats. The induction of key antioxidant enzymes and antiapoptotic proteins may function as protective mechanisms that are necessary for surviving torpor.",

For hoary bats, Lasiurus cinereus, their ecology is largely known from summer with the exception that they move long distances during autumn and spring and maintain some level of activity year-round. Autumn is a critically important period for hoary bats as they complete long-distance migrations between summer and winter range and they mate, both of which are energetically expensive. We studied hoary bat roost selection during autumn in a migratory stopover area in redwood habitat in northwestern California. We hypothesized that hoary bats select day roosts during autumn migration that minimize energetic expenditures and improve mating opportunities. We located 24 day roost sites of male hoary bats and evaluated site-level roost selection by comparing roosts with 120 random locations. We used multiple logistic regression to compare remotely sensed habitat features derived from LiDAR and other spatial data. The three most important variables for distinguishing roost from random locations were distance to creek, roads, and meadow. We speculate that selection of roosts in proximity to open spaces and flyways facilitated social behaviors related to mating that are commonly observed in this area.",

It evolved from a continental ancestor related to the Leisler’s bat Nyctalus leisleri and is considered threatened because of its restricted and highly fragmented distribution. We studied the genetic variability in 159 individuals from 14 colonies sampled throughout the archipelago. Sequences of the D-loop region revealed moderate but highly structured genetic variability. Half of the 15 distinct haplotypes were restricted to a single island, but the most common was found throughout the archipelago, suggesting a single colonization event followed by limited interisland female gene flow. All N. azoreum haplotypes were closely related and formed a star-like structure typical of expanded populations. The inferred age of demographic expansions was consistent with the arrival of founder animals during the Holocene, well before the first humans inhabited the Azores. Comparisons with a population of N. leisleri from continental Portugal confirmed not only that all N. azoreum lineages were unique to the archipelago, but also that the current levels of genetic diversity were surprisingly high for an insular species. Our data imply that the Azorean bat has a high conservation value. We argue that geographical patterns of genetic structuring indicate the existence of two management units.",

Although the two species are phenotypically very different, mtDNA  studies detected very low genetic divergence between them, which could question the validity of the species status of N. azoreum. In order to assess the genetic variability in each species and check for present levels of gene flow between the two taxa, eight microsatellite loci were genotyped and analysed. The results indicated lower genetic diversity in the insular species. Many unshared alleles were found between the two species and no evidence of migrants, which provides strong support against any contemporary gene flow between them. The species status of the Azorean bat is discussed in the light of the cohesion species concept, and we conclude that it is an isolated species with a high conservation value.",

The fishing myotis (Myotis vivesi) is a species endemic to desert islands in the Gulf of California, where summers are extremely hot and winters are cold and windy. We explored thermoregulating abilities of M. vivesi measuring skin temperature (Tskin) on free-ranging individuals in winter 2010 and 2011, and in summer 2010. We also measured ambient (Ta) and roost (Troost) temperatures during the study, and we obtained data for wind speed at night time during winter periods. We found that all bats entered torpor in both winters and that at least three individuals hibernated for several days, which had not been reported previously for bats in subtropical deserts. In summer, three individuals entered short bouts of shallow torpor in early mornings. Roosts were slightly warmer than Ta in winter at nightime, and in summer they never reached temperatures > 38.7°C, even at Ta ≈ 45°C. Roost occupancy in winter was higher during windy nights in 2010 but no pattern was found in 2011. Therefore, in winter fishing myotis were more likely to remain in their night roosts and enter torpor when ambient conditions (e.g., strong winds) limit fishing on marine waters. In summer, roosts provide good insulation against high Ta, and bats might not need to resort to torpor to lower their metabolic rate except for a brief period during early mornings. When resources are limited the use of torpor may increase this insular species’ chances of survival.",

Morphology of the humerus of these taxa is described in a comparative framework to document taxonomic assessments and provide a basis for future studies of fossil bat faunas. The relevance of the new records reported here is evaluated at a broader continental scale, as well as in contrast with the recent bat fauna of the region. The record of Noctilio leporinus stands as the first fossil occurrence of this species on the South American continent.",

The second most important food items in the northern Mesopotamian plain and the mid-Zagros are beetles (Coleoptera, 12.6–28.2% volume), while in northern Zagros Homoptera (16% volume) are the next important food items. The diet of R. mehelyi in northern Zagros is characterized by a low proportion of Coleoptera (10%) and the presence of more diverse prey species (12 categories). In the northern Mesopotamian plain and in mid-Zagros, the food items consist mainly of lepidopteran and coleopteran species with fewer additional prey species. Species groups occurring only in the diet of Mehely’s Horseshoe Bat in the northern Zagros are Odonata, Trichoptera, Dictyoptera and Acarina.",

The pups at birth had a mean body mass of 3.74±0.09 g and forearm length of 24.3±0.31mm. The length of forearm and body mass increased linearly during first two weeks, and thereafter maintained an apparent stability. The epiphyseal gap of the fourth metacarpal phalangeal joint increased until the thirteenth day, then decreased linearly until the 70th day and thereafter fused. The rate of body mass gain and forearm growth during the first 13 days was 0.54 g/day and 1.39 mm/day, respectively. Initiation of flight occurred three weeks after birth. A method of estimating age was derived from the values of the forearm length and the total gap of the fourth metacarpal-phalangeal joint during the pre-flight and post-flight periods.",

After mating, some sperm remain in the male's epididymis, the organ where the sperm had matured. It has not yet been determined if apoptotic markers participate in the process of the maturation and/or elimination of these cells, so studying this topic is essential for our understanding of this species. Male bats were collected during three stages: Before mating; during the Mating phase; After mating and the final phase, which we call, Storage. Their epididymides were removed, weighed and measured. Sperm were extracted and the following sperm parameters were evaluated: active caspases, phosphatidylserine externalization, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Sperm from the testes enter the epididymis during Before mating, causing the organ to grow. During Mating phase, spermatozoa present a large amount of active caspases with externalization of phosphatidyl serine, even while still alive. This suggests that these two markers could participate in maturation and elimination, respectively.",

Until now, only one extant population is known to live in one single cave in the westernmost part of Cuba, within the Guanahacabibes National Park. Over multiple trips, we recorded ultrasonic vocalizations from several individuals of this species. We found short, high frequency-modulated multiharmonic calls for N. primus; these could be used to identify this species in acoustic inventories conducted in Cuba. Identifying N. primus through their echolocation calls will allow conducting passive acoustic monitoring, constituting a noninvasive approach to study this vulnerable species without causing disturbances on its roosts and foraging areas.",

Tests were devised to discern between interspeciﬁc interactions and regional responses to geographic and environmental variables, using extensive capture data from 18 montane rain forest sites. No signiﬁcant correlation between captures was found. Additionally and according to the hypothesis of historical occupation of highland versus lowland forests, each species has shown speciﬁcity in their response to the geographical and environmental variables. Our results indicated that abundance patterns in these bats likely result from the regional distribution of each species rather than local interactions between them, a pattern that may have ancient roots within the group.",

This cave is the only mating roost known for this species. Pollen grains from faeces and fur were examined. Little is known about the diet of this bat, especially in the southern half of its distribution. Pollen belonging to 10 plant species was found from five families: Cactaceae (Stenocereus beneckei), Bombacaceae (Ceiba aesculifolia, Pseudobombax ellipticum), Convolvulaceae (Ipomoea arborescens), Fabaceae (Calliandra houstoniana, Bauhinia ungulata), and Amaryllidaceae (Agave dasylirioides, A. horrida, A. inaequidens, A. salmiana). Bats showed the highest dietary diversity in November. There were no significant differences in diet between sexes. Of the four Agave species, two have paniculate inflorescences that are commonly attributed to bat pollination, while the other two had spicate inflorescences, which are considered to be primarily insect-pollinated.",

Despite their wide geographical radiation and advances in studies using evolutionary approaches, aspects related to the reproduction of these animals remain poorly explored, especially those related to the male reproductive accessory glands (RAGs). Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the morphophysiology of the male RAGs in the bat Artibeus lituratus. The RAGs in A. lituratus are composed of a compact intraabdominal glandular complex, consisting of the prostate with two prostatic regions (ventral and dorsal), plus Littre glands and a pair of extra-abdominal bulbourethral glands. The ventral region of the prostate has an epithelium with variable morphology, due to its holocrine type of secretion. In contrast, the dorsal region has a typical cubic-to-columnar pseudostratified epithelium. Both regions contain two cell types, basal and secretory cells. Similar to the epithelial morphology, the secretion also varies, with the ventral region containing numerous PAS-positive globular vesicles, whereas the dorsal region has a more fluid, hyaline and PAS-negative secretion. Littre glands are dispersed in the connective tissue of the urethra, while the bulbourethral glands are located in the penile root, both glands with cubic-to-columnar pseudostratified epithelium and globular PASpositive secretion. The results demonstrate that the RAGs of A. lituratus are composed of two prostatic regions, ventral and dorsal, and urethral and bulbourethral glands, with no seminal vesicles. Each prostatic region has unique and distinctive characteristics, with the ventral region presenting an exclusive holocrine nature and the dorsal region having similarities to the ventral prostate of rodents.",

We report an unexpected high diversity of malaria parasite genera in bats from West African forest ecosystems. Two lineages are closely related to\n              Plasmodium\n              parasites from rodents, which are common laboratory model systems, and the results are consistent with switches between these hosts over their evolutionary history. Bats are considered important reservoir hosts for many pathogens, particularly viruses, and have unusually high immunological tolerances. The abundant malaria parasite infections are consistent with this exceptional immunology and suggest that in bats the parasites repeatedly evolved life cycles away from disease-causing replication in red blood cells to less pathogenic propagation in liver tissue.\n            \n          , \n            \n              As the only volant mammals, bats are captivating for their high taxonomic diversity, for their vital roles in ecosystems—particularly as pollinators and insectivores—and, more recently, for their important roles in the maintenance and transmission of zoonotic viral diseases. Genome sequences have identified evidence for a striking expansion of and positive selection in gene families associated with immunity. Bats have also been known to be hosts of malaria parasites for over a century, and as hosts, they possess perhaps the most phylogenetically diverse set of hemosporidian genera and species. To provide a molecular framework for the study of these parasites, we surveyed bats in three remote areas of the Upper Guinean forest ecosystem. We detected four distinct genera of hemosporidian parasites:\n              Plasmodium\n              ,\n              Polychromophilus\n              ,\n              Nycteria\n              , and\n              Hepatocystis\n              . Intriguingly, the two species of\n              Plasmodium\n              in bats fall within the clade of rodent malaria parasites, indicative of multiple host switches across mammalian orders. We show that\n              Nycteria\n              species form a very distinct phylogenetic group and that\n              Hepatocystis\n              parasites display an unusually high diversity and prevalence in epauletted fruit bats. The diversity and high prevalence of novel lineages of chiropteran hemosporidians underscore the exceptional position of bats among all other mammalian hosts of hemosporidian parasites and support hypotheses of pathogen tolerance consistent with the exceptional immunology of bats.",

Although both bat species are considered the pollinators of N. tetetzo, the probability of pollination of each bat species has not been estimated. In this study, we determine the relative importance of C. mexicana and L. yerbabuenae as pollinators of N. tetetzo. The probability of pollination was estimated using two different approaches: (i) morphological correspondence between head (linear traits [total head length, snout length, and face height and width]) and cranial traits (shape traits) of bats and flower traits (linear [internal floral tube length including and excluding the nectary, corolla diameter, stamen length, style length, and corolla tube diameter] and shape traits), and (ii) pollen load analyses to estimate the percentage of occurrence (PO) and the pollination probability index (PPI). Our results showed a lack of a significant correspondence between both head and cranial traits of C. mexicana and the flowers of N. tetetzo, and linear morphological correspondence between total head length of L. yerbabuenae and flower length. Pollen loads of C. mexicana were composed by seven different pollen types, its PO and PPI were 41.87 ± 9.53% and 0.29, respectively. Leptonycteris yerbabuenae pollen loads were composed by three pollen types, with a PO of 78.29 ± 13.67% and a PPI of 0.67. Our results suggest that whereas C. mexicana has a low constancy to the flowers of N. tetetzo, L. yerbabuenae has a higher probability of pollination.",

This sequence was placed with Vespertilio sinensis (Asian parti-colored bat) in a COI gene tree but with Hypsugo alashanicus (Alashanian pipistrelle) in a cytochrome b gene tree. Direct comparison of mitogenomes showed that 92.4% of this mitogenome is similar to Vespertilio sinensis, 5.9% to Hypsugo alaschanicus, and that 1.6% of the mitogenome could not be attributed to either species, or any other species. This mitogenome has been re-used in at least 17 phylogenies. Our findings suggest that mitogenomes are best verified with multiple gene trees, followed by direct comparison of sequences. We conclude that greater vigilance is warranted to ensure that problematic sequences do not enter the scientific record, and are not re-used in subsequent studies.",

However, a casual observation revealed R. ferrumequinum overcame serious accidental human disturbance by securing a new maternity cave and forming a new colony. The ability of R. ferrumequinum to respond flexibly to unexpected disturbance may be advantageous for the prosperity as the dominant Japanese cave-dwelling bat.",

However, very few studies have confirmed these relationships in free‐ranging mammals.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  This study uses an ecologically diverse sample of bats to document the variation in bite force with respect to gape angle, and applies three‐dimensional models of the feeding apparatus to identify the major morphological and biomechanical predictors of the gape‐bite force relationship.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    In vivo\n                    and model data corroborated that bite force decreases significantly at wide gapes across species, but there is substantial intraspecific variation in the data obtained from live bats. Results from biomechanical models, analysed within a phylogenetic framework, revealed that species with larger temporalis muscles, higher temporalis stretch factors and high mechanical advantages experience a steeper reduction in bite force with increasing gape. These trends are illustrated by short‐faced durophagous frugivores.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  The results from this study suggest that gape‐mediated changes in bite force can be explained both by behavioural effects and cranial morphology, and that these links are relevant for functional analyses of mammal dietary ecology.",

Given its great importance, this work aimed to evaluate the uterine hormonal control of A. lituratus during its different reproductive phases. The uteri of 30 sexually mature adult females, five specimens for each of the six sample groups (NON, nonreproductive; P1, initial pregnancy; P2, intermediate pregnancy; P3, advanced pregnancy; LAC, lactating; P + LAC, pregnant-lactating), were submitted to analyses of serum estradiol and progesterone concentrations, in addition to immunohistochemical analyses. Both estradiol and progesterone, gradually increased during pregnancy, with a marked significant increase in P3 females. Both returned to low levels in LAC-females; however, estradiol levels decreased further in P + LAC-females, while progesterone increased in the same group. In general, signs indicative of aromatase expression were observed in the endometrium of all analyzed groups and in the placenta of bats in the gestation groups. Similarly, ERα and PR were expressed in the myometrium, endometrium and placenta at varying levels of intensity. The results indicate that the uterine microenvironment of A. lituratus is directly regulated by serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone, and fluctuations in these concentrations control morphological and physiological changes of this organ during different phases of the reproductive cycle.",

            "abstractNote": "For elusive mammals like bats, colonization of new areas and colony formation are poorly understood, as is their relationship with the genetic structure of populations. Understanding dispersal and group formation behaviors is critical not only for a better comprehension of mammalian social dynamics, but also for guiding conservation efforts of rare and endangered species. Using nuclear and mitochondrial markers, we studied patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation among and within breeding colonies of giant noctule bats (Nyctalus lasiopterus), their relation to a new colony still in formation, and the impact of this ongoing process on the regionwide genetic makeup. Nuclear differentiation among colonies was relatively low and mostly nonsigniﬁcant. Mitochondrial variation followed this pattern, contrasting with ﬁndings for other temperate bat species. Our results suggest that this may indicate a recent population expansion. On average, female giant noctules were not more closely related to other colony members than to foreign individuals. This was also true for members of the newly forming colony and those of another, older group sampled shortly after its formation, suggesting that contrary to ﬁndings for other temperate bats, giant noctule colonies are not founded by relatives. However, mother–daughter pairs were found in the same populations more often than expected under random dispersal. Given this indication of philopatry, the lack of mitochondrial differentiation among most colonies in the region is probably due to the combination of a recent population expansion and group formation events.",

The Y1 chromosome showed a small block in the pericentromeric region and Y2 was found to be almost completely heterochromatic. Slides treated for C-banding and stained with DAPI/DA or DAPI/AMD (CB-DAPI) showed a heterochromatin block pattern similar to that obtained by C-banding. Triple staining with CMA3/DA/DAPI revealed CMA3-positive blocks in the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and DAPI-positive blocks in the interstitial region of the short arm of chromosome 1 and in the telomeric regions of the short arms of chromosomes 2, 3 and 5. Triple staining also showed Rand G-banding patterns rich in GC and AT base pairs, respectively. The nucleolar or.ganizer region on the long arm of the X chromosome was CMA3 neutral and DAPI negative.",

            "abstractNote": "Use of roosts by the golden-tipped bat Kerivoula papuensis was investigated principally in the Richmond Range National Park, north-eastern New South Wales and Mt Baldy State Forest in north-eastern Queensland, Australia. Roosts were located primarily using radiotelemetry; although others were found by light tagging, visual location and nest searching techniques. In the main study site in the Richmond Range a total of 54 K. papuensis diurnal roosts were located, 96.5% occurring in the suspended nests of the yellowthroated scrubwren Sericornis citreogularis (Pardalotidae) (93%) and the brown gerygone Gerygone mouki (Pardalotidae) (3.5%). At Mt Baldy, K. papuensis displayed greater variation in day roost selection, although 73% were in S. citreogularis nests. In both sites, day roosts were con®ned to the lower stratum of rainforest with a small proportion in eucalypt tall open forest with a rainforest subcanopy. Diurnal roosts were located at distances varying from 20 to 1200 m to the nearest major vegetation ecotone, ranging from along watercourses upslope to ridgelines. Diurnal roosts were predominantly occupied by single bats, with a maximum group size of eight individuals. All roosts in hanging nests were modi®ed by the presence of a basal hole. Strong circumstantial evidence was provided that K. papuensis modi®ed these roost structures in a manner allied to tent-making bats. A single maternity roost was located in the hollow of a rainforest canopy tree, Flindersia australis (Rutaceae).",

This report describes the management and evaluation of a group of straw-colored fruit bats, Eidolon helvum, that were exposed to carbaryl. Cholinesterase activity of blood, retina, and brain was evaluated to further investigate whether carbaryl was the causative agent. Decreased whole blood and retinal cholinesterase activity coupled with the response to atropine suggests that the cause of the clinical signs in this bat colony was due to carbaryl exposure. Whole blood and retinal tissue may be the best samples for conﬁrming carbamate exposure in this species.",

Grisebach in the biome of the Atlantic rain forest, southern Brazil. On Santa Catarina Island, ﬂowering extends from mid-September to the end of December, with diurnal anthesis. The reproductive system is obligatory xenogamy, thus pollinator-dependent. Flowers secrete 31.84 ll of nectar per day, with a mean sugar concentration of 23.2%. Highest nectar volume and sugar concentration occur at the beginning of anthesis. Most ﬂoral traits are characteristic for ornithophily, and nectar production appears to be adapted to the energy demand of hummingbirds. Continued secretion of the sucrose-dominated nectar attracts and binds visitors to inﬂorescences, strengthening trapline foraging behaviour. Experiments assessing seed set after single ﬂower visits were performed with the most frequent visitors, revealing the hummingbird Thalurania glaucopis as the most effective pollen vector. In addition, bees are also functional pollinators, as substantiated by their high visitation frequency. We conclude that this pollination system is bimodal. Thus, there is redundancy in the pollination service provided by birds and bees, granting a high probability of successful reproduction in Ae. nudicaulis.",

However, despite these similarities, their foraging behaviour is noticeably different. Our aim was to examine the extent to which these different foraging strategies reﬂect morphological adaptation. We assessed whether the morphology of the wing, body, and tail differed between M. myotis and M. blythii. In addition, in a laboratory experiment involving an obstacle course, we compared differences in manoeuvrability by relating them to our morphological measurements. The two species differed in their overall size, wing-tip shape, and tail-to-body length ratio. The generally smaller sized M. blythii performed better in the obstacle course and was therefore considered to be more manoeuvrable. Although differences in wing-tip shape were observed, we found the most important characteristic affecting manoeuvrability in both species to be the tail-to-body length ratio. Additionally, when we compared two bats with injured wing membranes with unharmed bats of the same species, we found no difference in manoeuvrability, even when the wing shape was asymmetric. We therefore postulate that morphometric differences between the two species in their overall size and, more importantly, in their tail-to-body length ratio are the main physical characteristics providing proof of adaptation to different foraging and feeding strategies.",

Because the immune system is energetically costly, spleen size is expected to be condition-dependent. Parasites also can influence spleen size. Parasites draw resources from their host, with consequences for host body condition. Male American mink (Neovison vison) were examined for parasite prevalence, intensity, and richness to test several predictions: individuals in good condition have large spleens; heavily parasitized individuals have large spleens; and heavily parasitized individuals are in poorer condition than individuals with few parasites. Spleen mass was related positively to both body condition and parasite richness, but spleen mass was not associated with prevalence or intensity of individual parasites. Body condition was related weakly to the intensity of parasitism by the giant kidney worm and sinus worm, but otherwise parasite prevalence, intensity, or richness were not associated with body condition. These results are similar to those found in studies of birds, suggesting that comparable processes occur in mammals.",

PAS, Alcian Blue (pH 2.5) and Alcian Blue (pH 1.0) stainings detected only neutral glycoconjugates. Lectin-binding analyses included LTA, UEA-I, ConA, SBA, BSI-B4, AAA, DBA, PNA, and WGA. WGAand PNA-bindings were also tested after β-elimination to detect O-linked glycans. Parietal cells were negative for binding to LTA and UEA-I, and to PNA and WGA after β-elimination, indicating the lack of (1,2) fucosylated residues and of N-linked glycans, respectively. Immunohistochemical tests with anti-α- and anti-β-H+,K+-ATPase were positive. Two alternative patterns of glycoconjugate distribution were found, i.e. a perinuclear and a diffuse one, indicating localization in the intracellular canaliculus and in the tubulovesicular system of the parietal cells, respectively. Both the subunits of the H+,K+-ATPase and the galactosyl/galactosaminyl residues were co-distributed in both the perinuclear and the diffuse patterns, suggesting that the residues are part of the protonic pump. Glycosyl/glycosaminyl and mannosyl groups were concentrated in the tubulovesicular system, and fucosylated residues were found almost exclusively in the intracellular canaliculi; thus they are probably not included in the oligosaccharide chains of β-H+,K+-ATPase. These findings indicate that the oligosaccharide chains linked to the β-H+,K+-ATPase subunit in R. ferrumequinum have distinct features compared to the other mammals studied and confirms the taxon specificity of the chains in the proton pump.",

            "abstractNote": "Most insectivorous bat species in the Neotropical family Phyllostomidae glean insects from ground, water or vegetation surfaces. They use similar and stereotypical echolocation calls that are generally very short (less than 1–3 ms), multi-harmonic and frequency-modulated (FM). By contrast, the common sword-nosed bat,\n              Lonchorhina aurita\n              , which has the longest noseleaf in the entire phyllostomid family, produces distinctly different echolocation calls. They are composed of a constant frequency (CF) component with a peak frequency of 45 kHz, followed by a short FM down-sweep at the end. With a mean call duration of 6.6 ms (max. 8.7 ms) when flying in the open they have the longest echolocation calls reported from phyllostomid bats. In cluttered environments, the CF-component is very short. In open habitats, however,\n              L. aurita\n              can emit pure CF-calls without the terminal FM-component. We also recorded in the field a distinct terminal group that closely resembles the feeding buzzes of aerial hawking bat species from other bat families. This is the first time the echolocation call design of\n              L. aurita\n              is presented. In addition, we contrast the echolocation behaviour of individuals flying in open and confined situations. Our results suggest that the unique echolocation system of\n              L. aurita\n              represents an adaptation to aerial hawking, a very unusual hunting mode within the phyllostomid family.",

            "abstractNote": "Gleaning insectivorous bats that forage by using echolocation within dense forest vegetation face the sensorial challenge of acoustic masking effects. Active perception of silent and motionless prey in acoustically cluttered environments by echolocation alone has thus been regarded impossible. The gleaning insectivorous bat\n              Micronycteris microtis\n              however, forages in dense understory vegetation and preys on insects, including dragonflies, which rest silent and motionless on vegetation. From behavioural experiments, we show that\n              M. microtis\n              uses echolocation as the sole sensorial modality for successful prey perception within a complex acoustic environment. All individuals performed a stereotypical three-dimensional hovering flight in front of prey items, while continuously emitting short, multi-harmonic, broadband echolocation calls. We observed a high precision in target localization which suggests that\n              M. microtis\n              perceives a detailed acoustic image of the prey based on shape, surface structure and material. Our experiments provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence that a gleaning bat uses echolocation alone for successful detection, classification and precise localization of silent and motionless prey in acoustic clutter. Overall, we conclude that the three-dimensional hovering flight of\n              M. microtis\n              in combination with a frequent emission of short, high-frequency echolocation calls is the key for active prey perception in acoustically highly cluttered environments.",

Understanding how WNS, or other threats, impacts western bats may require monitoring other roosts, such as maternity roosts and night roosts, where bats aggregate in large numbers.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Little brown bats (\n                    Myotis lucifugus\n                    ) are experiencing some of the greatest declines from WNS. Estimating survival and understanding population dynamics can provide valuable data for assessing population declines and informing conservation efforts.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    We conducted a 5‐year mark–recapture study of two\n                    M. lucifugus\n                    roosts in Colorado. We used the robust design model to estimate apparent survival, fidelity, and abundance to understand population dynamics, and environmental covariates to understand how summer and winter weather conditions impact adult female survival. We compared the fidelity and capture probability of\n                    M. lucifugus\n                    between colonies to understand how bats use such roosts.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Overwinter survival increased with the number of days with temperatures below freezing (\n                    β\n                     > 0.100,\n                    SE\n                     = 0.003) and decreased with the number of days with snow cover (\n                    β\n                     < −0.40,\n                    SE\n                     < 0.13). Adult female fidelity was higher at one maternity roost than the other. Overwinter and oversummer adult female survival was high (>0.90), and based on survival estimates and fungal‐swabbing results, we believe these populations have yet to experience WNS.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    Recapture of\n                    M\n                    .\n                    lucifugus\n                    using antennas that continuously read passive integrated transponder tags allows rigorous estimation of bat population parameters that can elucidate trends in abundance and changes in survival. Monitoring populations at summer roosts can provide unique population ecology data that monitoring hibernacula alone may not. Because few adult males are captured at maternity colonies, and juvenile males have low fidelity, additional effort should focus on understanding male\n                    M. lucifugus\n                    population dynamics.",

            "abstractNote": "This study investigated allozyme and morphometric variability within the genus Cynopterus, with particular emphasis on C. nusatenggara, which is endemic to Wallacea, the area encompassing the Oriental-Australian biogeographic interface. The genetic distances between Cynopterus species are small by mammalian standards and suggest that this genus has undergone a recent series of speciation events. The genetic distance between populations of C. nusatenggara is strongly correlated with both the contemporary sea-crossing distance between islands and the estimated sea crossing at the time of the last Pleistocene glacial maximum, 18,000 B.P. This observation, together with low levels of population substructure within islands as shown by F-statistics, indicates that the sea is a primary and formidable barrier to gene exchange. The genetic distance and the great-circle geographical distance between the populations of C. nusatenggara are not correlated, although a principal-coordinates analysis of genetic distance reveals relationships between the populations that are similar to their geographical arrangement. A strong negative correlation exists between the level of heterozygosity within island populations of C. nusatenggara and the minimum sea-crossing distance to the nearest large source population. This is interpreted as reflecting an isolation effect of the sea, leading to reduced heterozygosity in populations that have larger sea barriers between them and the large source islands. Independently of this, heterozygosity is negatively associated with longitude, which in turn is associated with systematic changes in the environment such as a gradual decline in rainfall from west to east. The association between heterozygosity and longitude is interpreted as reflecting an association between genetic and environmental variance and supports the niche-width theory of genetic variance. Morphometric variability did not show any of the main effects demonstrated in the genetic data. Furthermore, there was no evidence that, at the level of individuals, genetic and morphometric variability were associated.",

            "abstractNote": "Summary Two decades ago D. J. Keegan reported results on Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus, Megachiroptera) that were strangely at odds with the prevailing understanding of how glucose is absorbed in the mammalian intestine. Keegan’s in vitro tests for glucose transport against a concentration gradient and with phloridzin inhibition in fruit bat intestine were all negative, although he used several different tissue preparations and had positive control results with laboratory rats. Because glucose absorption by fruit bats is nonetheless efficient, Keegan postulated that the rapid glucose absorption from the fruit bat intestine is not through the enterocytes, but must occur via spaces between the cells. Thus, we hypothesized that absorption of water-soluble compounds that are not actively transported would be extensive in these bats, and would decline with increasing molecular mass in accord with sieve-like paracellular absorption. We did not presume from Keegan’s studies that there is no Na+-coupled, mediated sugar transport in these bats, and our study was not designed to rule it out, but rather to quantify the level of possible non-mediated absorption. Using a standard pharmacokinetic technique, we fed, or injected intraperitonealy, the metabolically inert carbohydrates Lrhamnose (molecular mass=164·Da) and cellobiose (molecular mass=342·Da), which are absorbed by paracellular uptake, and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3OMDglucose), a D-glucose analog that is absorbed via both mediated (active) and paracellular uptake. As predicted, the bioavailability of paracellular probes declined with increasing molecular mass (rhamnose, 62±4%; cellobiose, 22±4%) and was significantly higher in bats than has been reported for rats and other mammals. In addition, fractional absorption of 3OMD-glucose was high (91±2%). We estimated that Egyptian fruit bats rely on passive, paracellular absorption for the majority of their glucose absorption (at least 55% of 3OMD-glucose absorption), much more than in non-flying mammals.",

Nevertheless, there was a significant interaction between the prey category and season, suggesting that these two factors are not independent from each other. Coleoptera (49.6% in the culled parts, calculated as percent composition) dominated in spring (SeptemberNovember), Orthoptera (38.8%) in summer (DecemberFebruary), Hemiptera (42.8%) in autumn (MarchMay), and Lepidoptera (36.3%) in winter (JuneAugust). The diet also included a frog and a small fish (n = 2 parts).",

The reproductive cycle is characterized by a three-month period of delayed implantation and the total length of pregnancy may be as much as 10 months. A histochemical study of the gonadotrophs and mammotrophs of the anterior pituitary, in conjunction with assays of LH-like, progesterone-like and prolactin-like immunoreactivity in the plasma suggest that during delayed implantation the gonadotrophs were inactive while the mammotrophs were active and plasma PRL-like immunoreactivity high. We interpret this as indicating that, in the straw-coloured fruit bat, implantation was inhibited by high levels of prolactin and, as such, the endocrine control of delayed implantation may be quite different from that described for other mammals.",

            "abstractNote": "Bats account for one-fifth of mammalian species, are the only mammals with powered flight, and are among the few animals that echolocate. The insect-eating Brandt's bat (Myotis brandtii) is the longest-lived bat species known to date (lifespan exceeds 40 years) and, at 4-8 g adult body weight, is the most extreme mammal with regard to disparity between body mass and longevity. Here we report sequencing and analysis of the Brandt's bat genome and transcriptome, which suggest adaptations consistent with echolocation and hibernation, as well as altered metabolism, reproduction and visual function. Unique sequence changes in growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors are also observed. The data suggest that an altered growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1 axis, which may be common to other long-lived bat species, together with adaptations such as hibernation and low reproductive rate, contribute to the exceptional lifespan of the Brandt's bat.",

Intensive land management practices, such as logging and agriculture, frequently reduce cavity availability and potentially affect the long‐term viability of populations.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    The New Zealand long‐tailed bat\n                    Chalinolobus tuberculatus\n                    selects roosts in small knot‐hole cavities with specific structural properties relative to available cavities. They also change roosts daily among a large pool of different roosts. Such behaviour is likely to make\n                    C. tuberculatus\n                    vulnerable to human‐induced deterioration in roosting habitat.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    This study represents a case study of the degree of sophistication sometimes required to assess availability and quality of roost sites, by testing whether roosts selected by\n                    C. tuberculatus\n                    also have specific microclimates.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Selection for microclimate was demonstrated by comparing temperature and humidity inside unoccupied maternity roosts with available, apparently unused, knot‐hole cavities, large trunk‐hollows and ambient conditions.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    Compared with ambient conditions, roost and available knot‐hole cavities had stable microclimates displaying only small ranges in temperature and humidity. Temperature inside cavities was lower than ambient temperature in the day and was warmer (and peaked) at night. Humidity in cavities was constantly high. Mean temperatures within trunk‐hollows (not known to be used by\n                    C. tuberculatus\n                    ) were cooler than mean ambient and roost temperatures, and temperature ranges in hollows were large and fluctuated similarly to ambient temperatures.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  Compared with available cavities and hollows, roost cavities had higher minimum temperatures, and maximum temperatures occurred significantly later in the day and continued for significantly longer. Humidity ranges were less and high humidity was maintained for longer.\n                \n                \n                  \n                    The results suggest that\n                    C. tuberculatus\n                    selects maternity roost sites with microclimatic conditions that are likely to accrue substantial energetic benefits. Predicted energy savings for adult bats using roost cavities compared with available knot‐holes were 1·1–3·3%, and compared with hollows 3·4–7·3%. Greater energy savings would occur at night and benefit non‐volant young.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  In order to evaluate adequately and mitigate the full impacts of land‐use practices, there is a need for wider tests to provide direct evidence of interactions between habitat management, cavity provision and survival of cavity‐dependent wildlife.",

In bats with a vast geographic distribution this can give the ability to perform different reproductive patterns throughout their geographic range. Delayed implantation has been observed in several species of bats of which one, the Schreiber’s Long-Fingered Bat Miniopterus schreibersii, occurs in Iran. Information obtained from two females provided evidence on delayed implantation in Miniopterus schreibersii through microscopic observation of the corpus luteum in late October. Assuming that fertilization takes place immediately after follicogenesis, evidence on approximate parturition time provided sufficient information to construct the annual reproductive cycle for this bat in western Iran. The total gestation length of Miniopterus schreibersii in western Iran is 7.5 to 8 months.",

Most of the values are similar to values previously seen in other pteropodid bat species. Differences included a lower than expected reference interval for the total white blood cell count, a wider reference interval for glucose, and a higher reference interval for 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Establishing reference intervals for hematologic and biochemistry analytes for bats that were maintained on the same diet and under the same husbandry parameters for several years will help in the future assessment of other bats maintained in a similar manner.",

We radio-tracked 73 bats during spring±autumn of 1993 ±1997 to 155 day roosts, all of which were in trees. One hundred and forty-nine roosts were in cavities: 84 in live trunks, 33 in dead trunks, 32 in large branches (seven in dead branches, 25 in live); and the remaining six (occupied by solitary bats) were beneath loose bark. We compared characteristics of the 84 roost cavities in live trunks with 57 random available cavities also in live trunks. Cavities used by C. tuberculatus were not a random subset of available cavities. In comparison to available cavities, bat roosts were all located in knot hole cavities, were high from the ground, and had little surrounding vegetation. All roosts were dry inside. Bats used a higher proportion of cavities which had medium sized entrances and internal cavities, and thicker cavity walls. A logistic regression model incorporating nine cavity variables classi®ed roost and available cavities correctly 97% and 91% of the time, respectively. Distance to the nearest vegetation, cavity condition (wet or dry inside), height from the ground, and to a lesser extent internal cavity height, explained signi®cant proportions of the variation between roost and available cavities. Bats changed roost sites virtually every day and it appeared that suitable cavities were abundant in the unlogged forests of the study area. It is unlikely that modi®ed forests and forests managed for timber production contain such a large pool of potential roosting cavities.",

Length of forearm and body mass followed a linear pattern of growth until day 14 (at mean rates of 1.44 mm/day and 0.43 g/day respectively), and subsequently decreased to reach a stable level. The length of the total gap of the metacarpalphalangeal joint increased up to 10 days and decreased when it closed at over 70 days. Initiation of flight occurred 3-4 weeks after birth. A method of estimation of age was derived from values of length of forearm and the total gap of the fourth metacarpal-phalangeal joint during the preflight and post flight periods.",

Light at night is particularly problematic for bats as most species are nocturnal and often cross relatively large distances when commuting between roosts and foraging grounds. Earlier studies have shown that illumination of linear structures in the landscape disturbs commuting bats, and that the response of bats to light may strongly depend on the light spectrum. Here, we studied the impact of white, green, and red light on commuting Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii). We used a unique location where commuting bats cross a road by flying through two identical, parallel culverts underneath. We illuminated the culverts with white, red, and green light, with an intensity of 5 lux at the water surface. Bats had to choose between the two culverts, each with a different lighting condition every night. We presented all paired combinations of white, green, and red light and dark control in a factorial design. Contrary to our expectations, the number of bat passes through a culvert was unaffected by the presence of light. Furthermore, bats did not show any preference for light color. These results show that the response of commuting Daubenton's bats to different colors of light at night with a realistic intensity may be limited when passing through culverts.",

Nine microsatellite loci were isolated and tested on a population of 39 samples from Yunnan Province, China. These nine loci had three to 22 alleles per locus. Observed and expected heterozygosity values ranged from 0.079 to 0.963 and from 0.078 to 0.959. Two loci revealed significant departure from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and no linkage disequilibrium was found between loci pairs. These microsatellites can be a powerful molecular tool for population-level studies of E. spelaea.",

A cartilaginous baculum anlage was evident at late embryonic stages. Initially, the distal part of the baculum develops during embryogenesis as a cartilage. Then the growth of the shaft and formation of the proximal portion occurs and it is shortly followed by ossification of the whole structure. The baculum continues to grows during the first months of the postnatal life and its length is correlated with that of the forearm. The baculum reaches its definitive shape and size by the age of 1.5 month in N. noctula and two months in V. murinus. Therefore, after this time period, the shape and size of the baculum cannot be used for age determination.",

Length of forearm and body mass followed a linear pattern of growth until day 14 and subsequently decreased to reach a stable level. The length of the gap of the metacarpal-phalangeal joint showed an increase up to 10 days and decreased until it had closed at over 55 days. Initiation of flight occurred approximately four weeks after birth. During the first two weeks of postnatal growth, the body mass and the length of forearm of pups increased linearly at mean rates of 0.58 g/day and 1.55 mm/day, respectively. A method of estimation of age was derived from values of forearm length and the total gap of the four metacarpal-phalangeal joint during the preflight and post flight periods.",

The results show that this bat remains primarily a Coleoptera feeder in both maternity and summer quarters, although a more diverse feeding habit is found in the summer roosts. Data indicate that in the summer roosts a high dominance of beetles (Coleoptera) accounted for 77 and 89% of the recovered items by volume, while in the maternity roost 86% of the volume belongs to the beetles. Prey types recovered in the summer quarters which were not represented in the maternity roost included small numbers of Diptera, Neuroptera and Hymenoptera.",

Phylogenetic analysis shows that Pipistrellini is multiline origin, Pipistrellus-like bats can be divided into three groups: PipistrelliniNyctalini, Vespertilionini-Eptesicini, and Asian Pipistrelles. Hypsugo alone become a clade, Vespertilio and Eptesicus phylogenetic relationship are closer, Pipistrellus and Nyctalus have a close phylogenetic relationship.",

Estimates of species diversity based on classical morphological criteria (current taxonomy) were compared to diversity estimates based on monophyly and cytochrome-b sequence divergence. The most recent taxonomic list included nine species, whereas the genetic based list contained 11: anderseni, azteca, bogotensis, cinerea, glauca, gnoma, phaeotis, rava, rosenbergi, tolteca, and watsoni, of which three (bogotensis Andersen, rava Miller, and rosenbergi Thomas) have been considered synonyms of cinerea, glauca, phaeotis, and tolteca by previous authors. In addition, we consider incomitata to be a synonym of watsoni. Phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA sequences resolved the interrelationships among taxa and prompted us to re-evaluate some morphological characters that support the distinction of all the recognized taxa, therefore providing a robust estimate of species status. A phylogenetic tree revealed a geographic component to the diversification of Dermanura, including a historical connection between western Andean and Middle American biota. In South America, no species has been recorded from both sides of the Andes Mountains, and at least one clade (glauca, gnoma, and bogotensis) is restricted to the eastern versant of the Andes. Using genetic data (monophyly and genetic distance) to identify species we were able to produce testable genealogical and biogeographic hypotheses to facilitate further studies.",

            "abstractNote": "Abstract\n            \n              Invasive pathogens threaten wildlife health and biodiversity. Physiological responses of species highly susceptible to pathogen infections following invasion are well described. However, the responses of less susceptible species (relative to highly susceptible species) are not well known. Latitudinal gradients, which can influence body condition via Bergmann's rule and/or reflect the time it takes for an introduced pathogen to spread geographically, add an additional layer for how mammalian species respond to pathogen exposure. Our goal was to understand how hosts less susceptible to pathogen infections respond to long‐term pathogen exposure across a broad latitudinal gradient. We examined changes in body mass throughout pathogen exposure time across the eastern United States (latitude ranging 30.5° N–44.8° N) in\n              Eptesicus fuscus\n              , a bat species classified as less susceptible to infection (relative to highly susceptible species) by the invasive fungal pathogen that causes white‐nose syndrome,\n              Pseudogymnoascus destructans\n              (\n              Pd\n              ). Using 30 years of spring through fall adult capture records, we created linear mixed‐effects models for female and male bats to determine how mass or mass variation changed across the eastern United States from pre‐\n              Pd\n              invasion years through\n              Pd\n              invasion (0–1 years with\n              Pd\n              ), epidemic (2–4 years with\n              Pd\n              ), and established years (5+ years with\n              Pd\n              ). By\n              Pd\n              establishment, all female and male bats decreased body mass with increasing latitude across a spatial threshold at 39.6° N. Differences in bat mass north and south of the spatial threshold progressively increased over\n              Pd\n              exposure time‐steps such that body mass was lower in northern latitudes compared to southern latitudes by\n              Pd\n              establishment. Results indicated that the progressive differences in\n              E. fuscus\n              body mass with latitude across the eastern United States are due to long‐term pathogen exposure; however, other environmental and ecological pressures may contribute to decreases in\n              E. fuscus\n              body mass with latitude and long‐term pathogen exposure. As pathogen introductions and emerging infectious diseases become more prevalent on the landscape, it is imperative that we understand how less susceptible species directly and indirectly respond to long‐term pathogen exposure in order to maintain population health in surviving species.",

This study revealed new records of pond bats in the area including a small maternity roost. Recorded activity was high over broad waterways, lower over large ponds and medium sized waterways and very low over small waterways. Pond bats were observed hunting over waterways with different pollution levels from mild to heavier pollution. However more activity was recorded over waterways with mild and moderate pollution than over polluted waterways, whereas Daubenton’s bat Myotis daubentonii was found hunting over all waterways regardless the pollution level.",

In Bolivia Micronycteris is represented by 4 species: M. hirsuta, M. megalotis, M. minuta, and M. sanborni. Through examination of morphological characters and analyses of cranial measurements and genetic data, we determine that M. sanborni is not found in Bolivia and describe a new species closely related to it. The new species is morphometrically distinct from its congeners, forming a cluster separate from M. schmidtorum, M. minuta, and M. brosseti along principal component (PC) 1 (explaining 57.3% of the variation and correlated with maxillary toothrow length) and also separate from M. sanborni along PC 2 (explaining 35.4% of the variation and correlated with condylobasal length). The new species forms a statistically supported clade in all phylogenetic analyses; however, a sister relationship to M. sanborni is not supported. Genetic distance values that separate Micronycteris sp. nov. from its closest relatives range from 5.3% (versus M. sanborni) to 10.4% (versus M. minuta from Guyana). We diagnose and describe the new species in detail and name it in honor of the late Terry Lamon Yates for his contributions to Bolivian mammalogy. Micronycteris sp. nov. is Bolivia’s 1st endemic bat species and because of its importance, the conservation implications are discussed.",

            "abstractNote": "The pteropodid fruit bat genus Eidolon is comprised of two extant species: E. dupreanum on Madagascar and E. helvum on the African mainland and offshore islands. Recent population genetic studies of E. helvum indicate widespread panmixia across the continent, although island populations off western Africa show genetic structure. Little is known about the genetic connectivity of E. dupreanum or the divergence time between these two sister species. We examine sequence data for one mitochondrial (cyt-b) and three nuclear regions (β-fib, RAG1, and RAG2) to assess population genetic structure within E. dupreanum and divergence between the two Eidolon spp. In addition, we characterize the demographic history of both taxa using coalescent-based methods. We find little evidence for population structure within E. dupreanum, and suggest that this reflects dispersal based on seasonal fruit availability and a preference for roosting sites in exposed rock outcrops. However, despite apparent panmixia in both Eidolon spp. and large dispersal distances reported in previous studies for E. helvum, these two taxa diverged in the mid-to-late Miocene. Both species are also characterized by population expansion and young, Pleistocene clade ages, although slower population growth in E. dupreanum is likely explained by its divergence via colonization from the mainland. Finally, we discuss the implications of population connectivity in E. dupreanum in the context of its potential role as a reservoir host for pathogens capable of infecting humans.",

We studied western long-eared bats (Myotis evotis (H. Allen, 1864)) in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta to test the hypothesis that different costs of torpor result in different patterns of thermoregulation and roosting behaviour for reproductive and nonreproductive females. We radio-tracked bats to monitor body temperatures and locate roosts. We took roost measurements and inserted temperature data loggers to measure roost microclimate. Bats entered torpor frequently, but nonreproductive females spent longer periods in torpor, had lower minimum body temperatures, and entered deep torpor more often than reproductive females did, supporting the hypothesis that entering torpor is more costly for reproductive individuals. Roosts were located mainly in rock fields on steep, open, south-facing slopes. Reproductive females roosted in crevices between rocks located above or on the surface of the ground. Roosts warmed rapidly and reached warm daytime temperatures. Females roosted alone during pregnancy but formed small colonies within roosts during lactation when ambient conditions were cooler. Clustering may reduce thermoregulatory costs for both adults and young. Nonreproductive females roosted mainly alone in crevices in the ground. These roosts had cooler, more stable microclimates, allowing females to enter deeper bouts of torpor and remain torpid longer.",

They commuted directly to foraging sites up to 13.4 km away at speeds often exceeding 40 km h-1. Except during lactation, individuals occasionally day-roosted away from the nursery in buildings or hollow trees. These were also sometimes used as night roosts, especially during rain, which also stimulated return to the nursery. On most nights the ®rst ¯ight lasted the longest. During preparturition, when distances from roost to foraging site were greatest, and time spent ¯ying per night (tF) was least, there was often only one ¯ight, with a second towards dawn on warmer nights, and occasionally a third. After parturition, in June, tF and the number of ¯ights (N F) increased up to weaning, corresponding to rising energy demands. But distances to foraging sites fell, rising only slightly in postlactation, presumably because insects, and thus feeding patches, were more abundant than in preparturition. N F fell to preparturition levels after lactation. Exploratory behaviour by juveniles intensi®ed with time ± distances to feeding sites, tF and the total distance ¯own each night all increased; the distance ¯own each night was eventually greater than any recorded for adults. Roosting away from the nursery was also more common. Before dispersal, there were extended migrations by juveniles outside the summer range of the adults. Distances moved by two dispersed juveniles exceeded 34 km. Two-thirds of the recorded foraging time was over pasture or drainage canals. Foraging over other habitats, particularly lake and conifer forest, was greatest in preparturition. Other habitats foraged included lights, estuary, stream, beach and dunes.",

            "abstractNote": "Bite force is a performance metric commonly used to link cranial morphology with dietary ecology, as the strength of forces produced by the feeding apparatus largely constrains the foods an individual can consume. At a macroevolutionary scale, there is evidence that evolutionary changes in the anatomical elements involved in producing bite force have contributed to dietary diversification in mammals. Much less is known about how these elements change over postnatal ontogeny. Mammalian diets drastically shift over ontogeny—from drinking mother's milk to feeding on adult foods—presumably with equally drastic changes in the morphology of the feeding apparatus and bite performance. Here, we investigate ontogenetic morphological changes in the insectivorous big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), which has an extreme, positive allometric increase in bite force during development. Using contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography scans of a developmental series from birth to adult morphology, we quantified skull shape and measured skeletal and muscular parameters directly related to bite force production. We found pronounced changes in the skull over ontogeny, including a large increase in the volume of the temporalis and masseter muscles, and an expansion of the skull dome and sagittal crest that would serve to increase the temporalis attachment area. These changes indicate that development of the jaw adductors play an important role in the development of biting performance of these bats. Notably, static bite force increases with positive allometry with respect to all anatomical measures examined, suggesting that modifications in biting dynamics and/or improved motor coordination also contribute to increases in biting performance.",

This revision focuses on the pale-bellied members of the genus using phylogenetic and morphometric tools, an increased sample size with all recognized taxa, and an expanded geographic coverage relative to prior studies. For the genetic analyses (n = 166), four molecular markers were concatenated, one mitochondrial (cytb), one nuclear (Fgb-I7), and two Y-chromosomal (DBY5 and DBY7). In the Bayesian and maximum likelihood analyses, the recognized subgenera Schizonycteris, Leuconycteris, Xenoctenes, and Micronycteris were recovered as monophyletic. The pale-bellied subgenera, Schizonycteris and Leuconycteris, were not sister clades; thus, venter coloration was not monophyletic. Leuconycteris was sister to the dark-bellied Micronycteris, and Schizonycteris was sister to the rest of the genus. Micronycteris schmidtorum was genetically defined for the first time, and it was determined all previous phylogenetic studies used a misidentified M. minuta from Bolivia. Our results showed a sister relationship between M. schmidtorum and M. brosseti, which redefines Leuconycteris. The subgenus Schizonycteris was also redefined, and it presented two well-supported clades from Central America and western Ecuador that are described as new species. Results are supported by a multivariate morphometric analyses (n = 114), karyological, and morphological comparisons. The taxonomic implications are discussed and emended diagnoses presented for the pale-bellied subgenera and for M. schmidtorum.",

Many landmasses in the Indo‐Australian Archipelago (IAA) are oceanic islands, and founder‐event speciation is expected to be the predominant form of speciation of volant taxa on these islands. We studied the biogeographic history of flying foxes, a group with many endemic species and a predilection for islands, to test this hypothesis and infer the biogeographic origin of the group.",

We extracted DNA from the holotypes of V. elisabethae and V. sinchi using strict ancient DNA protocols and sequenced the complete cytochrome-b gene of the mtDNA to investigate the phylogenetic relationships within the genus and employed species-delimitation tests to evaluate the validity of all the currently named species of Vampyressa. The resulting tree topology and our species-delimitation analyses corroborate the validity of V. elisabethae and V. voragine, but places V. sinchi in V. melissa. Based on these results and phenotypic variation, we recognize five valid species in Vampyressa and treat sinchi as a subspecies of a polytypic V. melissa; for which we provide a rediagnosis. Our results show that V. elisabethae is as highly divergent genetically as it is morphologically, and suggest that V. thyone, one of the two species of Vampyressa known to have wide distributions, is a species complex requiring further investigation.",

            "abstractNote": "Leptospirosis is a bacterial zoonosis that occurs in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Chiroptera are known to be a formidable reservoir of zoonotic pathogens, including leptospires. The epidemiology of leptospirosis in bats in the Pacific Islands is poorly known, both in terms of prevalence and in terms of the bacterial strains involved. A strong host specificity between leptospiral strains and their mammalian reservoir is recognized. This phenomenon has notably been studied recently in bat communities, providing strong evidence of co-evolution. In New Caledonia, a biodiversity hotspot where leptospirosis is endemic and enzootic, Chiroptera are the only indigenous terrestrial mammals. In this study, we aimed to investigate leptospires associated with three flying fox species in New Caledonia. Kidneys and urine samples of Pteropus spp. from captures and seizures were analysed. Among 254 flying foxes analysed, 24 harboured pathogenic leptospires corresponding to an observed prevalence of 9.45% with 15.8% on the Main Island and 4.3% on Loyalty Islands. The analysis of the rrs gene, lfb1, and MLST sequences evidenced four distinct clusters of undescribed strains, likely corresponding to undescribed species. All four strains belong to the Group I of pathogenic Leptospira spp., which includes Leptospira interrogans, Leptospira noguchii, and Leptospira kirschneri. We detected pathogenic leptospires in all three Pteropus spp. studied (including two endemic species) with no evidence of host specificity in two co-roosting species. For a better understanding of Leptospira–host co-evolution, notably to genetically characterize and evaluate the virulence of these original bat-associated leptospires, it is essential to improve isolation techniques. Flying foxes are traditionally hunted and eaten in New Caledonia, a massive cause of bat–human interactions. Our results should encourage vigilance during these contacts to limit the spillover risk of these pathogens to humans.",
