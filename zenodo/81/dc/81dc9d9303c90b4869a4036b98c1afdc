We used novel acoustic tomography to convert echoes into visual representations and compare these cues to traditional echo measurements. We provide a new hypothesis for the echo-acoustic basis of prey detection on surfaces. We propose that bats perceive a change in depth profile and an 'acoustic shadow' cast by prey. The shadow is more salient than prey echoes and particularly strong on smooth surfaces. This may explain why bats look for prey on flat surfaces like leaves using scanning behaviour. We propose that rather than forming search images for prey, whose characteristics are unpredictable, predators may look for disruptions to the resting surface (acoustic shadows). The fact that the acoustic shadow is much fainter on rougher resting surfaces provides the first empirical evidence for 'acoustic camouflage' as an anti-predator defence mechanism.\n          , \n            While bats are far from blind, they are famed for their use of sound waves to home in on their prey. As they fly, bats send out a series of high-frequency calls that bounce off nearby objects, including insects. By listening to the echoes, the bats are able to build up an auditory image of their environment and thus pinpoint the location of their prey.\n            Although echolocation is effective for localizing flying insects, it is less suited to detecting those that are resting on surfaces. This is due to the difficulty of distinguishing sound waves that bounce off the insect from those that are reflected by the surrounding surface. While some species of bats get around this problem by listening for faint sounds made by prey, such as mating calls or the fluttering of insect wings, a number of bat species have found a way to detect entirely motionless prey using echolocation.\n            Clare and Holderied have now worked out how bats might do this. A method was devised to convert the sound waves that bounce off an object into visual signals, and thus, open them up for analysis by human observers. This technique was used to scan moths of various shapes and sizes resting on different surfaces: smooth slate, leaves, coarse limestone, and rough bark. These experiments showed that the difference in the strength of the echoes from the moth and its surroundings varied depending on the texture of the surface.\n            Specifically, the difference was greatest when the insect was resting on smooth slate and smallest when it was on rough bark, suggesting that choice of surface affects how easy it is to spot an insect. Unexpectedly, however, the data also indicate that bats may search for insects by seeking out interruptions in the echoes from the surface, rather than trying to detect echoes from the prey itself. This makes the bats' task a little easier as it means that they do not have to make adjustments for the differing sizes and shapes of insects. Instead, they can use an acoustic search image for what the surface is like and look for missing parts covered up by the prey.\n            Clare and Holderied's findings thus generate a number of predictions about the behaviour of bats and insects in their natural environment. Bats should prefer searching for insects on smooth surfaces rather than rough ones; but insects might attempt 'acoustic camouflage' by choosing to rest on rough surfaces rather than smooth.",
